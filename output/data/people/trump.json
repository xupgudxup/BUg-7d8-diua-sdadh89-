    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Trump called for interest on credit cards to be capped for a year. UBS thinks that would end up hurting credit availability for some borrowers.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's idea to cap credit card interest could have far-reaching unintended consequences, UBS said on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was calling for a one-year, 10% rate cap for credit card interest, stating that the industry has been taking advantage of consumers.\n\nThe idea sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.\n\nWhile investors reacted to the latest threat to lenders' bottom line, UBS said that Trump's plan would have a negative impact on Main Street despite its intention to relieve high borrowing costs for many Americans.\n\nUBS analyst Erika Najarian said that the proposed credit card rate cap would likely backfire, as it would likely reduce consumer spending and curtail lending to certain borrower groups.\n\nNajarian said that credit card providers are more likely to dial back the availability of credit to certain borrowers, rather than simply offer cheaper credit.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that a 10% credit card rate cap would cut off credit availability to those that need it most: middle- and lower-income Americans,\" she added.\n\nThe team of analysts at UBS said that while they see a low likelihood of the plan becoming law, the overall impact on credit availability would be felt by both investors and consumers.\n\n\"According to the Boston Fed, the aggregate credit card spend by annual household income was as follows in May '25: 1) <$39k: ~$26bn; 2) $59-83k: ~$37bn; 3) >$121k: $175bn. Based on Boston Fed data, this means 26% of credit card spend, at least, would be at severe risk, implying a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP on average. Additionally, credit card spending accounts for nearly half of Visa's payment volume and more than half of Mastercard's. The kind of pullback predicted by UBS could severely compromise US economic growth.\n\nNajarian isn't the only finance pro to suggest that Trump's credit card rate cap plan could backfire. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman described it as a \"mistake\" and claimed that millions of credit cards could be cancelled as a result.",

Lower courts have found those tariffs to be illegal, and bettors on prediction market sites like Polymarket and Kalshi currently put the odds of a ruling against Trump at around 70%.\n\nIf that happens, the US may have to refund the billions of dollars in revenue that the government has collected from the IEEPA tariffs.\n\nTrump argued that the amount was worth \"Trillions of Dollars\" when accounting for investments that US companies have made to avoid tariffs.\n\n\"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about potential tariff refunds over the weekend, when he told Reuters that it \"won't be a problem if we have to do it.\"",

    "title": "Why the attack on Fed Chair Jerome Powell follows Donald Trump's typical playbook — and isn't going to stop there",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent from the president. The Justice Department investigation into Jerome Powell could change that.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump wants Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to do something Powell doesn't want to do.\n\nNow, Trump's federal prosecutors are now investigating Powell.\n\nThat's the shortest version of the news story that broke Sunday night, when Powell released an extraordinary statement and video, which I urge you to watch and read for yourself.\n\nKey quote from Powell, who Trump picked as Fed chair in 2017: \"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n(Trump told NBC on Sunday that he didn't have any knowledge of the investigation and that the DOJ wasn't trying to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. If you find that hard to believe, you might point to the fact that the investigation was reportedly authorized by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News anchor who is a longtime Trump ally.)\n\nAs Powell notes, using the threat of a criminal prosecution — fueled by a pretext — to pressure the Fed, which is meant to be independent of the White House but accountable to Congress, is unprecedented.\n\nBut the pattern most definitely has precedent in the Trump administration: Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen.\n\nIn this case, it's about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to lower rates. And more broadly, about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to answer to him.\n\nThat's why, prior to investigating Powell, he has also tried to remove Fed member Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee the Trump administration has accused of mortgage fraud. Cook fought Trump in court, and later this month the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case — and eventually rule on whether Trump can remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\n\nIt's easy to see many other examples of Trump trying the same thing. Trump, for instance, insisted that political enemies like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James should be prosecuted for … something. And when a Trump-appointed prosecutor declined to bring charges, Trump had him replaced with another appointee who would. Both of those cases have been dismissed by a federal judge, who said Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-installed US attorney who brought the cases, had been unlawfully appointed. The DOJ is appealing.\n\nOftentimes, the reactions to Trump's pressure campaigns amount to a shrug — Democrats complain, Republicans usually back him (or say nothing), and markets move around a bit before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nMaybe this time will be different: The Fed is supposed to be an institution that investors care about as a steady, guiding hand that doesn't swing wildly with political winds. Markets can ignore a lot of political ugliness; pressure on the Fed is harder to dismiss.\n\nThe broader pattern Powell is underlining goes well beyond monetary policy or even political score-settling. The administration has repeatedly paired aggressive action with a justification that is often strained at best. Prior to the raid that removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump and his proxies repeatedly insisted that Maduro and his country were killing countless Americans by bringing fentanyl into the US — which is not true. Last week, Kristi Noem, Trump's head of Homeland Security, said the shooting of a Minneapolis woman protesting an ICE raid was justified in part because she was a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\nSome of you will look at Trump's behavior and find something in there that you like, in an ends justify means formulation. Maduro was a terrible leader, so maybe you think that making up reasons to depose him doesn't matter much. Maybe you like Trump's deportation agenda, and aren't worried about him using masked agents with guns on city streets to make that happen.\n\nGive it time. We're still just a year into the second Trump administration, and his impulse to act without restraint has yet to find real pushback. \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me,\" he told The New York Times last week, when asked about the relevance of international laws and treaties. A president with an infinite target list and unchecked power is never finished.",

The White House did not provide additional information when reached by Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China and the United Arab Emirates are Iran's major trading partners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to reach a trade deal with China after both countries backed down from a tariff war in 2025. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the trade volume between China and Iran reached $13.37 billion in 2024, with China exporting $8.93 billion worth of goods to Iran and importing around $4.44 billion from the country. More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity shows that China exported $456 million and imported $208 million from Iran in October 2025.\n\nTrump's targeting of Iran comes as the country is experiencing mass protests against its government.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.\n\nThe approximately 15-minute call came after Sheinbaum said Friday she had requested dialogue with the Trump administration at the end of a week in which he had said he was ready to confront drug cartels on the ground and repeated the accusation that cartels were running Mexico.\n\nTrump has repeatedly offered to send the U.S. military after the cartels and Sheinbaum has always declined, but after the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.\n\n“He (Trump) asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrump “still insisted that if we ask for it, they could help” with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. “We told him, so far it’s going very well, it’s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch.”\n\nSheinbaum said Monday the two leaders agreed to continue working together.\n\nMexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente spoke Sunday with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for “tangible results” and more cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico shared those results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and fentanyl overdose deaths.\n\nExperts still see U.S. intervention in Mexico as unlikely because Mexico is doing what the U.S. asks and is a critical economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to do more.\n\nSheinbaum said the two leaders did not speak about Cuba, which Trump threatened Sunday. Mexico is an important ally of the island nation, including selling it oil that it will need even more desperately now that the Trump administration says it will not allow any more oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating nearly $12 million in grant funding awarded to the American Academy of Pediatrics that was canceled ​after the medical group clashed with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over changes ‌to vaccine policy.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction late on Sunday after finding the medical group ‌was likely to prevail on its claim that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services retaliated against it because of its advocacy in violation of its free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nShe said \"pejorative\" statements HHS officials had made attacking AAP because of its support of childhood vaccinations and gender-affirming care indicated they ⁠had \"clear animus\" toward the group when ‌its grants were terminated.\n\n\"When force and coercion replace reason in the marketplace of ideas, the public suffers by denial of access to high-quality information,\" wrote Howell, who was ‍appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama.\n\nAAP and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.\n\nHowell's ruling came after a judge in Boston last week cleared the way for AAP and other medical groups to move forward ​with a separate, earlier lawsuit they brought challenging HHS policies adopted under Kennedy that they say will ‌reduce U.S. vaccination rates.\n\nAAP said the seven grants were abruptly canceled on December 16, a day before the Boston judge heard arguments in that case, as part of an effort to discredit the group after it emerged as a vocal critic of major changes to federal vaccine policy under Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense before becoming the head of HHS.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ⁠and the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration administered the ​grants, which supported initiatives to reduce sudden infant death and improve care ​in rural communities, among other things.\n\nAAP broke with federal policy in August when it recommended that all young children get vaccinated against COVID-19, diverging from the U.S. Centers for ‍Disease Control and Prevention under ⁠Kennedy, which in May said healthy children can take the shots if parents and doctors agree they are needed.\n\nThe group sharply criticized a separate move by the CDC on January 5 to ⁠cut the number of vaccines it recommends every child receive as \"dangerous and unnecessary,\" and AAP continues to support gender-affirming care for ‌transgender youth, which the Trump administration has sought to restrict.",

    "description": "Stocks, bonds, and the dollar fell amid the DOJ's investigation into Powell. Credit card stocks plunged after Trump said interest should be capped.",
    "fullText": "The \"sell America\" trade is seeing a revival on Monday.\n\nInvestors were reacting to developments over the weekend, including a proposal to cap credit card interest rates and the Department of Justice's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMajor indexes were down in early morning trading, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points as investors took in the news.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Monday:\n\nThe Justice Department's probe relates to the Fed Chair's testimony last year about the renovation of the Fed's office buildings, a project Trump has criticized for its cost.\n\nTrump, who said he has decided on his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term ends his May, said he had no knowledge of the probe when speaking to NBC Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe market has a complicated reaction to situations when it appears that Trump is applying pressure on Powell. The president has demanded that the Fed chief lower interest rates for years, including in his first term. The concern is that if rates are lowered prematurely, it could backfire and cause inflation to flare up again, which would force the central bank to turn hawkish and potentially hike rates down the road.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction among investors is something markets have seen before.\n\n\"All these moves suggest a possible return of the 'sell America' trade,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note on Monday, referring to the broad sell-off in US assets in 2025 as investors fretted over tariffs and the health of the economy.\n\n\"Investors rushed to cut their exposure to US assets,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note, pointing to concerns about the Fed's independence. \"Investors were also rattled by the Fed Chair's robust response,\" he added, referring to the video statement from Powell released on Sunday.\n\nHere were the moves investors saw Monday morning.\n\nTreasury yields were up as US debt securities faced selling pressure. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield climbed two basis points.\n\n\"Treasury yields are higher, and the curve is steeper amid fresh attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence,\" John Canavan, a lead analyst at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors have shed Treasurys in other times when the president has meddled with the Fed or threatened Powell. Yields spiked last April when Trump first said he could fire the Fed chair, with the president tempering his views following big bouts of selling in the Treasury market.\n\nGold, which acts as a hedge against inflation and a haven during bouts of geopolitical turmoil, soared to records, rising 2% and breaking through $4,600 for the first time on Monday.\n\nThe precious metal is up 4% from levels at the start of the year and just recorded its best-ever annual run since 1979, around the time inflation began to soar in the US.\n\nDemand for safe havens looks \"strong,\" particularly as investors continue to weigh tensions between the US and other countries, like Venezuela and Greenland, Trade Nation's Morrison said.\n\nOther metals that typically rally alongside gold, like silver and copper, were also up.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, declined 0.4% on Monday, a possible sign that investors are reducing their exposure to dollar assets due to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"The investigation into Mr Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy, an unfavourable backdrop for the greenback,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The broader fear is that the move could continue to erode Fed autonomy, which may raise long-term inflation expectations and be bearish for the greenback,\" Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, wrote in a note.\n\nThe financial sector was rocked after Trump proposed that credit card interest rates be capped at 10% for a one-year period in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration. AFFORDABILITY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\n\"Trump's proposal to cap credit card rates at 10% for a year added another layer of uncertainty, particularly for banks,\" Morrison added.",

    "fullText": "Meta has a new president — and she's a former advisor to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tech giant named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman on Monday. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April before resigning in December.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as a deputy national security advisor to Trump. The president applauded her appointment on Truth Social: \"A great choice by Mark Z!!\"\n\nPowell McCormick is the second former Trump official appointed to a Meta leadership position in 2026. Last week, the company hired C.J. Mahoney, a deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, as its chief legal officer.\n\nHere are three things to know about Dina Powell McCormick:\n\nPowell McCormick worked as a Trump advisor during his first term, with a focus on the Middle East.\n\nShe had a personal tie to the region. Powell McCormick was born in Cairo, where her father was a captain in the Egyptian army. In 1977, her family moved to Dallas.\n\nDuring her stint with the Trump administration, Powell McCormick oversaw a $200 billion US-Saudi arms deal, spearheaded Trump's Middle East tour, and was considered to take over as Trump's chief of staff or representative to the United Nations.\n\nShe left the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nPowell McCormick also served under President George W. Bush. She started in a personnel role, before rising to senior White House assistant and assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAt the time of her resignation in 2007, Powell McCormick was the highest-ranking Arab American in the Bush administration.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell McCormick went to Goldman Sachs, where she was hired as a managing director.\n\nPowell McCormick shot up in stature, making partner in three years. Her rapid rise sparked some bitterness among Goldman's underclass, according to The New York Times and Vanity Fair.\n\nUnder her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women program. She also oversaw the 10,000 Small Businesses program and served as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nPowell McCormick was popular among some of Goldman's biggest names, including Anne Black, the former president of Goldman Sachs Gives and current managing partner at JP Morgan.\n\n\"She was really a steadfast champion for me and others of us on the team, who were all promoted thanks to her,\" Black told Vanity Fair. \"She elevated my game, inspired me to be creative and bold, and expected us to show results.\"\n\nPowell McCormick left Goldman Sachs in 2023.\n\nWhile Powell McCormick no longer works in politics, she's still involved through her husband: Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick.\n\nThe couple wed in 2019. Soon after, Dave began eyeing a Senate run, and Dina became involved in the campaign. She made trips to Mar-a-Lago with her husband and appeared in several ads.\n\nDave ended up conceding the Republican nomination to Mehmet Oz — also known as television's Dr. Oz — in the 2022 race. Oz lost the general election to John Fetterman and was later appointed by Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nIn 2024, Dave ran again, narrowly winning a Senate seat and beating incumbent Bob Casey. Dina accompanied him to his swearing-in.",

    "fullText": "All three living former chairs of the Federal Reserve rushed to Jerome Powell's defense after the current Fed chair said he is under criminal investigation.\n\nThe former chairs, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, led the central bank under presidents of both major political parties, dating back to Greenspan's first appointment by President Reagan in 1987.\n\nThe statement is also signed by five former Treasury secretaries, including former Secretary Hank Paulson, who was President George W. Bush's final full-time leader of the department. Three other Treasury secretaries, Yellen, Jack Lew, and Timothy F. Geithner, served under President Obama. Former Treasury Secretary Richard Rubin served under President Clinton.\n\nThe entire statement is included below:\n\nOn Sunday night, Powell said that the Federal Reserve had received grand jury subpoenas related to his testimony before the Senate in the summer. A subpoena is not an indictment, but it does demonstrate the extent to which the Justice Department is willing to pursue the case.\n\nFor months, Trump and the White House have argued that Powell misled Congress in his discussion of the renovations to the Federal Reserve building. In July, Powell led Trump and reporters on a tour of the $2.5 billion renovation, although the episode did not end the tensions between the pair.\n\nIn his statement, Powell said that the criminal investigation was \"not about Congress's oversight role\" but rather retaliation for the Fed's repeated decisions to hold interest rates steady before voting to lower rates in September.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell (a power that no president may have over the central bank chair) and has engaged in a very public search for Powell's replacement. Powell's term runs through May.",

    "description": "Venezuela is home to the world’s largest reported oil reserves. The country’s other commodities have also caught the Trump administration’s attention.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

    "description": "SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said that enacting Trump's credit card interest cap would cause a void in the industry that could be filled by personal loans.",
    "fullText": "Some billionaire CEOs and banking groups balked at President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest.\n\nIn an X post on Saturday, Noto wrote that the cap could encourage consumers to shift from credit cards to personal loans.\n\n\"If this is enacted—and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is—we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending. Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap,\" Noto wrote. \"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill.\"\n\nNoto wrote that personal loans could be an alternative for consumers looking to address debt.\n\n\"Also if this scenario plays out, underwriting discipline and borrower education become even more important,\" Noto wrote.\n\nTrump called for the cap in a Truth Social post on Friday, writing that his administration would \"no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies\" charging interest rates of 20% to 30% or more.\n\nEnacting the proposed cap would require an act of Congress. Additional details about the proposed cap haven't been released, but it has drawn concern from various corners of the financial world.\n\nBill Ackman, the billionaire CEO and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, called the decision a \"mistake\" in a now-deleted X post on Friday.\n\n\"This is a mistake President,\" Ackman wrote. \"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid.\"\n\nAckman shared a separate X post on Saturday, writing that reducing credit card interest rates was a \"worthy and important\" goal, but still disagreed with the cap.\n\n\"My concern about capping rates at 10% is that doing so will inevitably cause millions of Americans to have their cards cancelled as credit card companies lose the ability to adequately price subprime credit risk,\" Ackman wrote. \"Consumers denied credit cards will be forced to turn to loan sharks whose rates and terms will be vastly worse for borrowers.\"\n\nSeveral banking associations — including the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association — also criticized the proposed cap in a joint statement on Friday.\n\n\"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the statement said. \"We look forward to working with the administration to ensure Americans have access to the credit they need.\"",

    "fullText": "Republican Senator Rand Paul says President Donald Trump is shooting himself in the foot with his aggressive posturing towards Greenland.\n\nTrump has escalated his threats to take over the mineral-rich island, telling reporters Friday, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not.” The 79-year-old president said he would “do it the hard way” if he couldn’t strike a deal to acquire the territory.\n\nOn Sunday, Paul warned that Trump’s “denigrating” saber-rattling is backfiring by alienating GOP lawmakers in Washington and people in Greenland.\n\n“Let’s say you wanted to buy Greenland—and I’m not disputing that that might be something we might want,” the 63-year-old Kentucky senator said on ABC News’s This Week. “You don’t get there by angering and denigrating the people who live there and saying, ‘We’re going to march the Marines in and take it if you don’t sell it to us.’ It doesn’t make them very willing to sell to us.”\n\nPaul continued, “So really, if your goal is somehow we’re going to rattle the saber, then they’re going to sell it to us, I think it’s having the opposite effect. I think you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in Greenland for it, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find somebody in Washington who’s for a military invasion on either side of the aisle.”\n\nThe senator, one of the few Republicans who regularly challenges Trump, appears to be correct.\n\nGreenland’s party leaders issued a joint statement Friday night rejecting Trump in response to his latest assertions that the U.S. “needs” the island, a semi-autonomous territory within the Danish kingdom, and his refusal to rule out the use of military force.\n\n“We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people,” the statement said. “We would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States’ contempt for our country ends.”\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also rebuked Trump, reminding him that the U.S. has “no legal basis to annex” the territory.\n\nIn Congress, several GOP lawmakers, including Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, and Maine Senator Susan Collins, have openly condemned talk of the U.S. taking over Greenland.\n\nPaul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS Mornings last week that U.S. military action “won’t happen under my watch.”\n\n“I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland,” he said.\n\nABC News’s Martha Raddatz asked Paul on Sunday, “Do you actually think he would use military force, or are we overreacting to that?”\n\n“I would hope not,” Paul replied, reiterating his belief that Congress should decide if the military is deployed, whether in Greenland, Venezuela, or Colombia.\n\n“It’s about whether or not the people get a say in whether we go to war,” added the senator, who was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act last week. The resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nA White House official previously told the Daily Beast that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.”",

I didn't like their response. They're playing too cute,\" Trump said to the reporter.\n\nHe said that he did not like Exxon's response to his $100 billion plan to invest in the Venezuelan oil industry. On Friday, Exxon's CEO, Darren Woods, told the president that he does not think Venezuela is currently ripe for investment.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said in the meeting with Trump and oil executives at the White House.\n\nHe said that Exxon, which is based in Texas, has a long history in Venezuela, having operated in the country twice. He said the company has had its assets in Venezuela seized on both those occasions.\n\nWoods said that significant changes need to happen in the country to consider reentering, but he was confident the Trump administration could work with the Venezuelan government to implement those changes.\n\nHowever, other oil executives were more optimistic. Chevron's vice chairman, Mark Nelson, told Trump that the company plans to increase its current production with oil partners in Venezuela by 100% \"effective immediately.\"\n\nTrump's comments about Exxon come more than a week after US military forces launched a strike in Venezuela and captured the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Maduro is being tried by a New York court for drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nExxon's stock price has remained largely flat after the bell on Friday.

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday delivered a warning to Cuba, advising Havana to strike a deal \"before it is too late.\"\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the island nation would no longer receive oil or money from Venezuela.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump wrote. \"In return, Cuba provided 'Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!\"\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!\" he continued. \"I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"\n\nTrump turned his attention to Venezuela's oil industry after the US captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in Caracas last week. Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York on weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, American oil executives met with Trump and senior administration officials to discuss a proposed $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil operations.\n\nTrump earlier said the government may reimburse oil companies for growing their operations in Venezuela. The Big Oil executives at the meeting, for their part, appeared largely hesitant to reenter the volatile country before major reforms are made.\n\nFor Cuba, losing access to Venezuelan oil would be a big blow to its already uncertain economy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Cuba imports the majority of its oil from Venezuela — about 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day, per most estimates.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week on board Air Force One, Trump said Cuba appeared \"ready to fall.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they're going to hold out,\" he said. \"But Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"\n\nAsked whether the US would take military action in Cuba, Trump said he did not think it would be necessary, adding: \"I think it's just going to fall.\"\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump also positioned the US as Venezuela's protector moving forward, saying that most of the Cuban security personnel stationed in Caracas had been killed in the operation to seize Maduro.\n\nThe Cuban government announced that 32 of its nationals died during the US raid on the capital.",

    "description": "Hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle, an American oil company is attempting to extract billions of barrels of oil on Greenland, just as Trump is escalating tensions with the territory.",
    "fullText": "TASIILAQ, GREENLAND — Oil executives looking for the next massive source of petroleum have turned toward the Arctic for decades. Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "title": "We heard from over 400 student-loan borrowers. Here's what's on their minds, from repayment to relief.",
    "description": "Since December 5, over 400 student-loan borrowers have shared their stories while gearing up for Trump's major repayment overhaul this year.",
    "fullText": "\"I got student-loan forgiveness!\"\n\n\"I'm working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nIn one month, over 400 student-loan borrowers shared their experiences of repayment and relief with me in a brief survey.\n\nEach story was unique and touched on a range of themes, which will feed more in-depth stories on respondents' experiences throughout the year.\n\nAs 2026 shapes up to be a year of turmoil for student-loan borrowers due to President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul, I wanted to start by looking broadly at the main concerns on the minds of those who reached out.\n\nSome borrowers told me that they achieved student-loan forgiveness or repaid their loans in full. However, the majority of respondents reported a range of concerns about the future of their balances, including worries about losing a key affordable repayment plan, struggling to get help from their servicers, being in default on their loans, and more.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation includes the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two less generous options. It also eliminates the SAVE plan, which promised affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. Nearly half of the survey's respondents said they're enrolled in SAVE.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your student-loan story and having it highlighted in future coverage, fill out the survey here, and I'll be in touch. Here are some of the main themes that student-loan borrowers have shared so far.\n\nOn December 9, the Department of Education announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan, established by former President Joe Biden. A court has not yet approved the settlement. However, upon approval, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in SAVE, deny pending applications, and move all enrolled borrowers to existing repayment plans.\n\nWhile the department intended to eliminate SAVE by 2028, the settlement accelerates the timeline and would push the 7 million enrolled borrowers into new repayment plans with higher payments sooner than anticipated. Some borrowers in the survey described SAVE as a lifeline for them, and they expressed concerns about their ability to afford higher monthly payments on a new plan.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, told me.\n\nSome survey respondents said that they had their balances wiped out through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nOver 60 respondents said that they're pursuing PSLF, and while they're at different stages, the majority said that they're concerned about the future of the program. Trump's Department of Education finalized a rule to limit eligibility for PSLF following a March executive order that directed the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nThe new rule, set to go into effect in July, would exclude employers from PSLF who the department determines to have engaged in \"illegal activities\" that do not align with the administration's views.\n\nRespondents who are pursuing PSLF described feeling like a \"pawn\" and being \"held hostage\" due to the program's uncertainty.\n\nThe consequences of default are also weighing on some borrowers' minds. Beginning January 7, the Department of Education said it would start notifying about 1,000 borrowers in default that their wages will be garnished. It follows the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans in May 2025 after a five-year pause.\n\nOver 5 million borrowers are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made payments in more than 270 days. Some borrowers in default said they're expecting wage garnishment notices, while those who are not yet in default but are concerned about affording payments said they're worried garnishments are in their future.\n\nBorrowers in default described feeling \"depressed\" and \"anxious\" due to their repayment statuses.\n\nParent PLUS loans allow parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' education. It's also facing changes in Trump's spending legislation: the department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, which would limit parents' ability to help finance their kids' college experiences.\n\nSome Parent PLUS borrowers said they've been struggling with repayment long before Trump's proposed changes. For example, some are struggling to pay back the loans years after their kids graduated while balancing their own debt and expenses.\n\nParent borrowers described paying more than what they borrowed, with some saying taking out the loans was a \"mistake.\"\n\nIn addition to facing the changing federal student-loan landscape, some survey respondents reported balancing both federal and private student loans. Private student loans often have higher interest rates, and they're not eligible for federal relief programs, such as PSLF.\n\nHowever, some borrowers turn to the private lending market for additional financing, and the Department of Education's new proposed caps on borrowing could lead more borrowers to turn to private student loans to help pay for programs that federal aid would no longer cover.",

Their resources are infinite, while mine, even with the generosity of tens of thousands, are ultimately fixed.

    "fullText": "Some in the Trump administration are reportedly concerned with the speed at which officials claimed “domestic terrorism” in the aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting death of Minnesota mom Renee Good.\n\nGood was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who captured the incident on his own phone as he let off three rounds after Good refused to exit her van.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem immediately accused Good of “domestic terrorism” for trying to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nVice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump all repeated Noem’s talking points, with Vance accusing the media of lying about the incident.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that “even supporters of the president” are afraid the aggressive approach “risks undermining public confidence in the ongoing investigation.”\n\nOne person close to the administration told Politico, “Do I think it’s domestic terrorism? Yeah, I do. But it might not have been wise to say that at the outset, how [Noem] said it.”\n\nAnother administration official concerned about the incident widening the political divide told Politico, “I don’t know how we recover from this.”\n\nThey continued, “This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in.”\n\nVideos of the shooting incident have been circulating on social media, and some pundits have called them a “Rorschach test” for conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn Friday, Vance posted a new video angle that he claimed vindicated the officer for firing in self-defense, but liberals noted Good’s demeanor and words to the agent — “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you” — before she appears to turn the steering wheel away from the agent in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin commented on the video Vance posted, telling Politico, “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer, that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such.”\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he supported the FBI’s unusual move to block state officials from investigating the incident because Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is “a stupid person.”\n\nThe post ‘I Don’t Know How We Recover From This’: Trump Officials Reportedly Worried About Quick Claims of ‘Domestic Terrorism’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday called for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.",
    "fullText": "Bill Ackman did not mince words when giving his opinion of President Donald Trump's call for a temporary cap on credit card rates.\n\nIn a since-deleted X post, the hedge fund billionaire said late on Friday that Trump's call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year was a \"mistake\" that could lead to millions having their cards canceled.\n\n\"This is a mistake President,\" Ackman wrote. \"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid.\"\n\nTrump had taken to Truth Social earlier on Friday in a fresh effort to address the hot political issue of \"affordability,\" saying his administration intended to target lenders charging interest rates of \"20 to 30%.\"\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off,'\" he said. \"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%.\"\n\nSuch a cap would likely require authorization by Congress. It is unclear what moves the president could make to bypass this.\n\nIn a new post on Saturday, Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, said Trump's \"goal of reducing credit card interest rates\" was a \"worthy and important one,\" but he reiterated his concerns over a 10% cap.\n\n\"I have no investments in the credit card space so I am not the expert, but the market for credit cards appears highly competitive,\" Ackman continued. \"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies.\"\n\nTrump, who pledged to \"immediately bring prices down\" in office, has recently honed in on the topic of affordability.\n\nNew York City mayor Zohran Mamdani swept to victory in November after running a campaign focused on voters' cost-of-living concerns.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil industry was met with a muted response from US energy executives on Friday.\n\nWhile the promise to revive Venezuela's oil industry drew praise from many in attendance at the White House meeting, no concrete pledges were made, and Exxon CEO Darren Woods went as far as to describe the country as \"uninvestable\" at present.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said.\n\n\"Significant changes have to be made to those commercial frameworks, the legal system,\" he continued. \"There has to be durable investment protections, and there has to be change to the hydrocarbon laws in the country.\"\n\nWoods said he was nevertheless \"confident\" the US could help bring about the necessary changes, adding that Exxon would look to send a technical team to Venezuela to assess the state of operations.\n\nTrump has been pushing for major US oil firms to pump money into Venezuelan energy infrastructure since the capture of Nicolás Maduro last week.\n\nTrump, who promised companies \"total safety and security\" to operate in Venezuela, previously said the US could reimburse oil companies for expanding their operations in the South American nation, which has the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources and a longtime Trump supporter, appeared to dodge a question on whether his firm would be entering the country, saying it presented \"challenges\" but that it excited him \"as an explorationist.\"\n\nTrump appeared unfazed by the notes of caution, but he reminded those present that he had \"25 people that aren't here today that are willing to take your place.\"\n\nMark Nelson, the vice chairman of Chevron — which partners with Venezuela's national oil company PDVSA on production projects in the country — sounded a more positive tone.\n\nNelson said Chevron was \"committed\" to the country and that it may increase production by around 50% over the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nThe oil industry had gathered with Trump and other senior figures from his administration to discuss how the US planned to move forward in Venezuela following the ouster of Maduro.\n\nThe US has said the raid on Caracas was a law enforcement operation and has indicted Maduro on drugs and weapons charges.",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

    "fullText": "Nick and Brooke Shirley have for years published conspiracy-minded takes on hot-button rightwing issues\n\nYouTube influencer Nick Shirley, whose viral video alleging fraud by daycare centers servicing Minneapolis’s Somali American community came days ahead of the Trump administration’s declaration of a national funding freeze, has for years published conspiracy-minded takes on hot-button rightwing issues.\n\nHe also has close ties to the White House, Republicans, and to representatives of an earlier generation of rightwing partisan “ambush journalists” such as James O’Keefe. He worked with Minnesota Republicans to produce the viral video on Somali-run daycares.\n\nShirley has collaborated closely with his mother and fellow influencer Brooke Shirley, with the pair traveling together to flashpoints elevated by rightwing discourse online and in conservative media, and publishing across platforms including TikTok and YouTube.\n\nTheir US destinations have included the southern border, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, but they have also traveled overseas for big-ticket rightwing and anti-immigrant events including the Tommy Robinson-organized “Unite the Kingdom” rally last September.\n\nShirley’s videos frequently sensationalize conflict, or focus on street violence. The titles of recent videos include Dearborn Michigan has Fallen… Christians and Muslims Battle, Portland has Fallen… ANTIFA has Taken Control of City, and I Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street, the latter of which highlights a physical confrontation between Shirley and a street vendor in New York.\n\nShirley’s 26 December video, which targeted Minnesota’s Somali community with allegations of widespread fraud, became the basis for a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Somali content across social media, including in Truth Social posts by Donald Trump.\n\nFollow-up reporting by local outlets including CBS Minnesota and the Minnesota Star-Tribune, has found little factual basis for Shirley’s claims that daycare centers were claiming federal funding without caring for any children.\n\nMore than 90 people in Minnesota have been charged since 2022 in a $250m Covid-19 relief fraud scheme involving a non-profit that falsely claimed to provide meals to children, and a federal prosecutor estimated that $9bn or \n\nBut no fraud charges have been filed against the daycare centers featured by Shirley, though state records show some had code violations unrelated to fraud\n\nShirley’s latest video was the culmination of a years-long, peripatetic effort by the mother-and-son pairing to entrench themselves at the head of a burgeoning milieu of Maga-verse content creators.\n\nBrooke Shirley, 55, has posted hundreds of videos to her TikTok account beginning just two weeks after the January 6 protests at the United States Capitol, which Nick Shirley filmed himself attending.\n\nShe has also publicly defended the veracity of her son’s work. In November she told the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) that “what Nick is doing is journalism”, adding: “He’s documenting what is going on in America and in the world. And independent journalists are the ones that are out there.”\n\nThey also have a shared self-perception as truth-telling citizen journalists.\n\nThe Guardian contacted Brooke Shirley for comment via voice and text message on a cellphone number identified as an active connection in her name by several data brokers. Nick Shirley was contacted for comment via the contact email listed on his YouTube page, and which he has invited people to send tips on in the description field of his videos.\n\nPetros Iosifidos, professor of media and communications policy at City St George’s, University of London, and the co-author of the 2021 book Digital Democracy, Social Media and Disinformation, said: “Such a usage of social media does not aid democratic representation and instead contributes to a greater destabilisation of modern politics.\n\nHe added, “The situation has worsened in more recent years with widespread mis/disinformation that deprives the public of their fundamental right to have access to reliable, accurate information so to make informed decisions.”\n\nNick Shirley has emerged in the last two years as one of a new crop of news influencers who achieved a new level of salience at the tail end of the Biden years and have been actively cultivated by Trump’s White House.\n\nShirley was one of the invitees to a White House Antifa roundtable in October, at which influencers and administration officials aired their grievances about the amorphous social movement that has served as a Maga target since Trump’s first presidency.\n\nShirley dutifully posted a video of his speech at the event on his YouTube channel.\n\nReportedly, the attention from Shirley and other news influencers such as Savanah Hernandez led to an Ice sweep of the vendors, which was met by resistance from New York residents, and earned a rebuke from Zohran Mamdani, then a mayoral candidate, who called the tactics “aggressive and reckless”.\n\nOne media report quoted a resident of the Chinatown district where the vendors have been located for decades as saying that Ice “just take advantage of this because suddenly the rightwing media and online influencers came down into the area”.\n\nIn November, Shirley was awarded the “citizen journalist of the year” at the Citizen Journalism Gala held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, and hosted by James O’Keefe.\n\nThe month after the Mar-a-Lago ceremony, Shirley was collaborating with Minnesota Republicans to put the issue of purported fraud in the state’s Somali immigrant community on the national agenda.\n\nOn 29 December, House Republican leaders held a press conference in the wake of his videos.\n\nAt that conference, Lisa DeMuth not only backed the veracity of the video, telling reporters: “By now, everyone has seen the viral video that in under an hour exposed more than a million dollars in fraud.”\n\nShe also added: “Our caucus has been working to expose fraud for years, including working with Nick Shirley and agency whistleblowers to get the information out to the public and to hold the Walz administration accountable.”\n\nThe Guardian emailed DeMuth to ask for specifics on the collaboration, and whether the apparent inaccuracies unveiled by subsequent reporting were Shirley’s alone, or as a result of information provided by the caucus.\n\nA spokesperson referred to a man who appears prominently in the video, referred to only as “David” by Shirley, but who was later identified by the Minnesota Star-Tribune as David Hoch, a Minnesotan whose several paid political campaigns included an incident in which he campaigned “in nothing but shorts and a sandwich board on Minneapolis’ Nicollet Mall”.\n\nThey wrote: “Some of the information they used, including daycare locations, CCAP numbers, violations, etc, was given to David by caucus staff who found it in the official DHS licensing database and other publicly available sources.”\n\nShirley reportedly built his channel with shock and prank videos in the late teens, while he was still a high school student. After graduating in 2020, Shirley, a Mormon, took a hiatus during 2021 and 2022 while he completed a religiously ordained mission.\n\nAfter he returned from his mission in 2023, according to NPR, Shirley’s content took on a more sharply political and partisan character.\n\nPer Columbia Journalism Review reporting, this pivot was encouraged by Brooke: “It was Brooke – who was a former journalism student and a content creator herself – who pushed her son to cover the southern border,” the topic of several Nick Shirley videos in 2023.\n\nBrooke Shirley not only encouraged her son to make such content, but arguably led the way for him, having published pro-Maga content to TikTok since late January 2021, according to a Guardian review of the account.\n\nShe has also been closely involved in his work. In his acceptance speech at Mar-a-Lago, according to CJR, he thanked Brooke “for filming many of his videos”.\n\nEach has registered companies that appear to be related to their public output.\n\nAccording to Utah company records, Shirley was the organizer of Honey Badger LLC, whose purpose was “online media and related activities”, which was registered in April 2024 and administratively dissolved on 21 September 2025. Brooke Shirley, meanwhile, is the organizer of BT Outlook LLC, whose purpose is “social media and related activities”, which was incorporated on 30 September 2024.\n\nBoth companies were registered at the same residential address in suburban Farmington, Utah. It’s not known if BT Outlook LLC is the underlying entity for the pair’s news influencer activities.\n\nWhile Nick Shirley promotes his YouTube channel as being “here to entertain and bring the truth to all”, on Brooke’s TikTok account, which at the time of reporting had more than 290,000 followers, Brooke describes herself as a “boots on the ground Citizen Journalist!”, adding, “follow me for true news!”.\n\nBrooke’s boots frequently tread the same ground as Nick’s.\n\nThe pair’s video output indicates that they travel to the same places that have been the focus of conservative media and social media, and produce often-inflammatory content that reinforces conspiracy narratives about locales, individuals and groups that have been demonized in rightwing discourse.\n\nNick Shirley’s videos are usually longer, more complex, and more intensively edited than his mother’s, but the pair often cover the same ground.\n\nOn 28 October, for example, Nick Shirley published a video on YouTube which purported to offer an account of events on the ground in Portland, Oregon. His video played up stereotypes of the city which have emerged during the Trump era, focusing on homeless encampments, and scuffles outside the city’s ICE facility, which has been a focus for protesters and counter-protesters since the summer, and attracted a Trump-ordered national guard deployment, which has since ended after the supreme court judged it unconstitutional.\n\nIn a section of the video Shirley entitled “ANTIFA receives a new shipment”, Shirley showed a U-Haul truck resupplying protesters with barbecue ingredients and inflatable animal costumes.\n\nBetween 12 and 16 October, Brooke Shirley published five TikTok videos shot in the city. In one published on 17 October, Shirley features footage of the same costumes, groceries and charcoal grills highlighted by Nick in his longer YouTube video.\n\nIn the video, which features throughout a text insert reading “Antifa camp receives gear in Portland”, Brooke Shirley intones over footage of the set-up outside the ICE facility: “I’m in Portland, Oregon, and I’m going to show you what the ICE facility looks like,” adding: “Right over there you can get inflatables to put on. There’s food to eat. There’s tents to take a nap in, I guess.”\n\nAnother of Brooke Shirley’s Portland videos published on 15 October is focused on protesters wearing Tyrannosaurus rex costumes.\n\nIn that video, over footage of the blow-up theropods dancing with other protesters, Shirley asked viewers to “imagine if for 100 days this has been going on in front of your apartment complex. Because this has been going on for more than 100 days, 24/7”.\n\nThe same pattern repeats itself in the pair’s trips throughout the US and beyond to cover hot-button rightwing issues and events.\n\nOn 15 September, Nick Shirley posted video taken at the anti-immigrant Unite the Kingdom rally in London held two days earlier, where interviewees included a woman in a Union Jack bikini, and a man with severe facial contusions who was later seen confronting police officers.\n\nThe video also heavily featured the far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, who was one of the rally’s key organizers.\n\nShirley published a separate sit-down interview with Robinson.\n\nAround the rally, Brooke Shirley published interviews with attenders who offered praise for Donald Trump and the recently assassinated Charlie Kirk. The previous year, on a separate trip, Brooke Shirley published her own interview with Tommy Robinson.\n\nFollowing established practice, Brooke Shirley posted versions of the Minnesota story to her TikTok channel.\n\nOn 27 December, she posted a video captioned “The Somalians are masters at fraud and the government is dumb enough to allow it to continue to go on it. It’s easy to find the fraud. All you need to do is a little bit of research and visit the businesses. #minnesota #minneapolis”.\n\nA text insert on the video, which shows Brooke Shirley standing outside a purportedly empty ABC Learning daycare center in Minneapolis, reads: “Somalian-run Daycares all over Minnesota are closed yet collecting millions every year from the government.”\n\nIn the video, Brooke Shirley says: “This daycare right here, ran by Somalians, has taken in from the Minnesota government $1.1m.”\n\nShirley adds: “This daycare says it can hold up to 40 children. I went up to the door. The door is locked, and as you can see, the windows are blacked out. I can’t hear any children inside this daycare.”\n\nShirley continues: “It’s midday right now. You’d think there’d be children in there playing, being taught, but no one is in there.”\n\nFurther on, she asserts: “The Somalians are robbing the taxpayers in Minnesota blind.”\n\nNick Shirley’s identical claims about ABC Learning Center have been refuted by multiple outlets, including CBS Minnesota, who found timestamped security footage of children arriving on the day they visited the facility, with reporters seeing children being cared for when they visited.\n\nBrooke Shirley’s video had been viewed almost 360,000 times at the time of reporting.\n\nIn the past, Brooke Shirley has credited her son for her success on TikTok.\n\nOn 18 January 2025, following a brief TikTok shutdown arising from Biden-era legislation aimed at forcing the site’s Chinese parent company to divest, Shirley posted a video whose caption explicitly credited her son for her success on the platform.\n\n“I am saying goodbye for a moment hopefully we will be back! Thank you my TikTok family and friends!” Shirley wrote, adding “Thank you to my amazing son @Nick Shirley for making my dreams come true here on TikTok!!”\n\nThe accompanying video, soundtracked by Green Day’s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), featured a montage of still images of Shirley interviewing migrants at the southern border and cities around the country, attending Trump rallies and student protests, and standing outside homeless encampments.\n\nDespite persistent concerns about the quality of the information passed on by self-described “citizen journalists” like Shirley, Pew research suggests that one in five Americans regularly get news from social media content creators.",

    "fullText": "US President Donald Trump announced Thursday that American forces would begin ground operations in Mexico targeting drug cartels, following months of naval strikes in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\n\"We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,\" Trump said in an interview with broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News.\n\nTrump provided no additional information on the timing or scope of the planned land attacks.\n\nAny military strikes on Mexican territory without Mexico City's consent would violate international law and mark an unprecedented attack on a US ally and major trading partner.\n\nThe statement follows Saturday's Delta Forces-led capture of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro at a Caracas compound where he was sheltering, the culmination of an extended US military and economic campaign against his government. Maduro now faces drug trafficking charges in New York.\n\nUS strikes on narcoboats have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people since September, according to US officials. Trump has also recently revealed that US forces struck a docking facility for such boats in Venezuela.\n\nThe naval campaign has targeted vessels suspected of smuggling cocaine and fentanyl in international waters and near Venezuela's coast. Trump has described the operations as enforcing a blockade on drug trafficking.\n\nGround strikes on cartels in Mexico would represent a substantial expansion of US military involvement in the region.\n\nMexico's two most powerful criminal organisations, the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel, control vast territories and have been locked in violent competition that killed more than 30,000 people last year.\n\nTrump designated six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organisations in February 2025, a move Mexico condemned as threatening its sovereignty and potentially justifying military intervention.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has proposed constitutional reforms to strengthen protections against unauthorised foreign operations and has consistently rejected any US military presence on Mexican soil.\n\nSheinbaum said Monday that the Americas \"do not belong\" to any single nation, responding to Trump's assertion of Washington's \"dominance\" over the hemisphere after Maduro's capture.\n\nTrump said Sunday he has pressed Sheinbaum to allow deployment of US troops against Mexican cartels, an offer he said she previously rejected.\n\nOverdoses from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have caused more than 100,000 deaths in the US per year since 2021. Mexican cartels produce most of the fentanyl entering the US using chemical precursors sourced primarily from China.\n\nTrump designated the drug as a weapon of mass destruction in December 2025.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Trump would seek Congressional authorisation for strikes in Mexico. The US constitution grants Congress authority to declare war, although presidents have historically launched military operations without formal declarations.",

    "title": "Why Is Greenland Part of the Kingdom of Denmark? A Short History",
    "description": "From the Vikings to Trump: Greenland’s historic development negates recent White House territorial demands.",
    "fullText": "The first Nordic presence in Greenland dates back to Erik the Red, a Norse Viking banished from Iceland for manslaughter, who sought a new future in Greenland around the end of the 10th century. The name “Greenland” referred to the vegetation around Southern Greenland’s fjords, but the name was likely also given in an attempt to lure more Norse settlers to Erik’s settlement in Southeast Greenland. The Norse settlements in Greenland became part of a North Atlantic empire ruled from Norway.\n\nThe Norse stayed in Greenland for centuries. At the start of the 15th century, they disappeared with little trace. There are numerous possible reasons, including: a colder climate that made the island less habitable and conflict with the Inuit, who began to arrive in the areas that were populated by the Norse.\n\nIn 1721, Hans Egede, a Norwegian priest and missionary with support from the united Dano-Norwegian crown, reestablished contact with Greenland. A concern at the time was that the Norse settlers had missed the Reformation and were still Catholics. When Hans Egede arrived, however, he found only the Inuit, by then firmly established in most of Greenland, and he decided to focus his efforts on converting them to Christianity.\n\nThat marked the beginning of the colonial period. It was a slow start, and Norwegian-Danish influence in Greenland had to compete with other foreign powers, notably the Dutch. In a process that spanned generations, the Inuit were converted to Christianity, and Greenland was both politically and economically tied to Denmark-Norway in a colonial relationship.\n\nWhen the monarchy of Denmark and Norway broke apart in 1814, Denmark kept Greenland. Danish-Greenlandic colonial relations in the 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by a Danish paternalistic policy for cautious development, ensuring that Greenland would be a profitable colony. In 1916, Denmark’s rights to Greenland were confirmed by the United States, as part of a deal that facilitated the American purchase of the Danish West Indies. A controversy concerning a Norwegian claim to parts of Greenland ended in 1933, when the Permanent Court of International Justice, founded by the League of Nations, ruled against Norway.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the United Nations pushed for decolonization in Greenland. In 1953, the former colony was incorporated into Denmark and granted two seats in the Danish Parliament. In 1979, Greenland achieved Home Rule, which included the formation of the Greenlandic Parliament, and it gained self-rule in 2009 through the passage of a law that included a ‘blueprint’ for seeking independence. The 2009 law firmly established that the decision to go for independence from Denmark would now rest with the Greenlandic people.\n\nThere is no doubt that the majority of Greenlanders want to use this option eventually. Polls show this. Independence has been accepted in Denmark as well. However, polls also consistently show that Greenlanders do not want independence if the price is the collapse of the Greenlandic welfare state. Herein lies the challenge. Greenland is vast, stretching over more than 800,000 square miles, but its population is tiny, consisting of only 56,000 people. Furthermore, the climate remains harsh for most of the year, especially in the North. For these reasons, among others, the Greenlandic government remains dependent on a yearly block grant from Denmark of roughly $600 million, as well as on the Danish state supporting services in areas such as defense, coast guard, and law enforcement. Greenlandic independence, therefore, depends on substantial continued Danish assistance after independence, something the Greenlandic government has yet to convince Denmark to accept.\n\nIt is in this context that President Donald Trump saw an opening to acquire Greenland. American strategic interests in Greenland are not new, but stretch back into the 19th century. Extensive U.S. involvement in Greenland, however, did not materialize until the Second World War, triggered by the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. As such, the German occupation of Denmark put Greenland in a peculiar position and caused worry in the United States that Greenland’s geography could eventually be used against it. For that reason, Washington reacted favorably when the Danish ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, took the rather unusual step of proposing himself as the true representative of free Denmark, cutting bonds with the occupied country. Kauffmann offered the United States base rights in Greenland for the duration of the war.\n\nThis was the start of the U.S. presence in Greenland. After the Second World War, a liberated Denmark honored Kauffmann’s commitments, and from 1949, the United States and Denmark became allies through NATO. During the Cold War and the decades after, the U.S. safeguarded its security interests in Greenland: tracking Russian missiles, bomber planes, and nuclear-armed submarines from that location. This became the basis for the “Greenland card” in U.S.-Danish relations: the idea that base rights in Greenland constituted an important contribution from Denmark and Greenland to the U.S. and NATO.\n\nThis state of affairs changed with Donald Trump. In the broader context of U.S.-European relations in the age of “America First,” the U.S. had to push its ‘free-riding’ European allies to do more on every front. No longer would Washington be satisfied with having a free hand in Greenland. Instead, Denmark was now a bad ally for not taking responsibility for U.S. security concerning Greenland. In Trump’s narrative, this perceived Danish lapse justified an American takeover of Greenland in its entirety. Trump even went so far as to refuse to rule out the use of military force. Other reasons, voiced by Trump, included securing mineral wealth, especially rare earth minerals, as well as a more general ambition to make the U.S. greater through territorial expansion.\n\nThe Greenlandic right to self-determination should form the bedrock for any future developments. For that reason, as well as for many other reasons, the U.S. military conquest of Greenland is beyond unacceptable. The American public agrees: in a February 2025 poll, only 11% expressed support for using military force to take control of Greenland, while 69% opposed it. This may be why the Trump administration has not mentioned the military ‘option’ recently. Instead, the Trump administration now seems focused on winning over the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Greenlanders. At the same time, stories about US influence agents compiling lists of pro-American and anti-American individuals caused understandable worry in Nuuk and Copenhagen – a behavior that few countries would expect from their allies.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has not been particularly successful. A poll from January shows that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of joining the U.S., with 85% against it. Greenlandic politicians have rejected the idea on numerous occasions, and in March, the party leaders of all Greenlandic parties issued a joint rejection of American attempts to annex Greenland. Most telling, the Trump team had to give up on finding Greenlandic hosts willing to meet the Second Lady Usha Vance during her planned trip to Nuuk that month.\n\nWhere do we go from here? The United States should cease its ill-fated adventurism and work with Greenland and Denmark to secure its legitimate security interests. This would be nothing new, but a return to policies that served the United States well for the last 75 years.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes, people with no experience or talent, closet alcoholic wife beaters, inexperienced leaders who only know how to lie to keep favor with Trump’s falseness so they can hold their unearned positions in his inept government, a Congress full of Republicans acting like idiots with no conscience…He has divided us. How did we elect these creeps who have no spin, no values, no conscience, no way to save the USA.\n\n\"We need to take Trump at his word,\" he continues. \"Make America Great Again. It won't be easy while he is trying to turn our cities into battlegrounds so he can cancel our elections with marshal law and escape all accountability…Something has to change this. We know what to do. Rise up. Peacefully in millions. Too many innocence [sic] people are dying.\n\n\"It’s ICE cold here in America. There was no ICE before Trump. No soldiers in the streets before Trump. Every move he makes is to build instability so he can stay in power.\n\n\"He knows nothing about love,\" Young concludes. \"He does not know you are. Use your love of life, your love of one another, your love of children and theirs and ours. Peacefully. Now.\"\n\nWake up, people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America\n\nYoung's editiorial follows on from another piece where he expressed his outrage at the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a US immigration agent in Minneapolis on January 7. \n\n\"This morning an ICE officer shot a woman in the face three times for no reason in Minneapolis,\" he wrote. \"These ICE people do not operate like police. They are thugs. poor ID. Covered faces. Is ICE the new American Thug police?\"\n\nYoung also hit out at the administration's controversial comments on taking over Greenland, and at the removal of women and people of colour from military leadership.\n\nThis is not the first time Young has condemned Donald Trump's presidency. Last August, the singer-songwriter released a track called Big Crime in which he offered a searing indictment of Trump's second term in the White House.\n\nThe lyrics for one section of the song run:\n\n\"Got to get the fascists out\nGot to clean the White House out\nDon’t want soldiers on our streets\nThere’s big crime in DC at the White House\"",

    "description": "The White House claims \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure\" but it says the media shouldn't be \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"",
    "fullText": "The White House said Friday that it is “reviewing protocols” around economic data releases after President Donald Trump appeared to disclose sensitive jobs information ahead of its official publication, a move that economists described as “unprecedented” and potentially in violation of long-standing federal policy.\n\nIn a statement provided on background, a White House official said the episode stemmed from “an inadvertent public disclosure” following routine presidential briefings on economic data.\n\nThis occurred “following the regular procedure of presidents being prebriefed on economic data releases,” the official said. “The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.”\n\nThe official bristled at the criticism of the disclosure, arguing that media coverage had overplayed its significance.\n\n“Instead of grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy, however, the media would be better off covering what today’s job report actually shows,” the official said, adding that President Trump’s policies are “laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.”\n\nThe comments come after Trump posted an image to Truth Social late Thursday evening that included figures from Friday morning’s nonfarm payrolls report, hours before the data was released publicly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nOffice of Management and Budget policy bars executive branch officials from commenting on or releasing market-moving economic statistics prior to their official publication, and also prohibits public statements until at least 30 minutes after release. While presidents are briefed on jobs data in advance, those briefings are treated as confidential.\n\nBharat Kumar, an economist at the financial firm Futures First, spotted that the figures in Trump’s post matched the final numbers released Friday morning. Economist and professor at University of Michigan Justin Wolfers said on X the disclosure “unprecedented,” saying no prior White House had ever released market-moving jobs data ahead of schedule.\n\n“No serious country does this,” Wolfers wrote.\n\nThe figures would have been difficult to interpret, anyway, because the large revisions to earlier months meant that the actually new numbers could not be cleanly isolated to show what happened in December alone, Nick Timaraos, the Wall Street Journal’s chief economics correspondent, noted.\n\nFriday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 in December, with nearly all of the gains coming from healthcare and social assistance. Stocks edged higher following the release, easing fears of a sharper employment slowdown.\n\nThe leak had drawn limited attention before Kumar’s post, likely because the disclosure occurred on Truth Social, a platform with a very small audience. According to Pew Research Center, just 3% of U.S. adults say they have ever used Truth Social, compared with 84% who use YouTube, 71% Facebook, 50% Instagram, and 21% X.\n\nSome media outlets, instead of decrying a scandal, had fun with that element of the mishap, with the Financial Times’ voicey Alphaville paraphrasing the old hypothetical about a tree falling in the forest: “If a jobs report leaks on a social media platform no one uses, does it move the market?” (This reporter was delayed in filing this story because Truth Social appeared to malfunction, preventing access to both the post and the President’s page.)\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge said Friday that she expects to temporarily block efforts by the Trump administration to end a program that offered temporary legal protections for more than 10,000 family members of citizens and green card holders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said at a hearing that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order but did not say when it would be issued. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to end temporary legal protection for numerous groups and comes just over a week since another judge ruled that hundreds of people from South Sudan may live and work in the United States legally.\n\n“The government, having invited people to apply, is now laying traps between those people and getting the green card,” Justin Cox, an attorney who works with Justice Action Center and who argued the case for the plaintiffs, said. “That is incredibly inequitable.”\n\nThis case involved a program called Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, and impacts people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. Most of them are set to lose their legal protections, which were put in place during the Biden administration, by Jan. 14. The Department of Homeland Security terminated protections late last year.\n\nThe case involves five plaintiffs but lawyers are seeking to have any ruling cover everyone that is part of the program.\n\n“Although in a temporary status, these parolees did not come temporarily; they came to get a jump-start on their new lives in the United States, typically bringing immediate family members with them,” plaintiffs wrote in their motion. “Since they arrived, FRP parolees have gotten employment authorization documents, jobs, and enrolled their kids in school.”\n\nThe government, in its brief and in court, argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to terminate any parole program and gave adequate notice by publishing the termination in the federal registry. It also argued that the program's termination was necessary on national security grounds because the people had not been property vetted. It also said resources to maintain this program would be better used in other immigration programs.\n\n“Parole can be terminated at any time,” Katie Rose Talley, a lawyer for the government told the court. \"That is what is being done. There is nothing unlawful about that.\"\n\nTalwani conceded that the government can end the program but she took issue with the way it was done.\n\nThe government argued that just announcing in the federal registry that it was ending the program was sufficient. But Talwani demanded the government show how it has alerted people through a written notice — a letter or email — that the program was ending.\n\n“I understand why plaintiffs feel like they came here and made all these plans and were going to be here for a very long time,” Talwani said. “I have a group of people who are trying to follow the law. I am saying to you that, we as Americans, the United States needs to.”\n\nLower courts have largely supported keeping temporary protections for many groups. But in May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants for now, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million.\n\nThe justices lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.\n\nThe court did not explain its reasoning in the brief order, as is typical on its emergency docket. Two justices publicly dissented.",

    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "description": "Trump's Education Department concluded another round of negotiations focused on gainful employment, aimed at protecting student-loan borrowers.",
    "fullText": "How do you make sure you can afford the student debt you're taking on?\n\nIt's a complicated question that President Donald Trump's Education Department spent a week hashing out. On Friday, the department concluded negotiations and reached consensus on its proposal to strengthen accountability in student-loan borrowing, including revising the gainful employment rule.\n\n\"This is a game changer,\" Nicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, said in his closing remarks. \"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results.\"\n\nSome of these changes are part of Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The Department of Education has already completed negotiations on some of the student-loan provisions in the bill, including the creation of new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will begin taking effect in July.\n\nThe revisions debated this week include eliminating the debt-to-earnings ratio test, which ensured a borrower's student-loan payments are no more than 8% of their annual earnings. It said this would reduce complexity. Some education policy experts worry it would weaken protections for students.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that it \"makes a lot of sense\" for the Department of Education to streamline the metrics, but the proposal risks leaving students with debt they're unable to repay with the elimination of the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nGainful employment, first established by former President Barack Obama in 2014, cut off federal student aid for schools that offered programs that left students with unaffordable debt compared to their likely postgrad income. Trump repealed the rule during his first term in 2019, and former President Joe Biden reinstated it. The existing version went into effect in July 2024.\n\nBiden's version of the rule used two separate metrics to determine whether a program met gainful employment requirements: a debt-to-earnings test and an earnings premium test, which measured whether a typical graduate from the program is earning at least as much as they typical high school graduate in their state.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the debt-to-earnings test, the Department of Education's proposal would allow programs to continue receiving Pell Grant funding even if they fail the earnings premium test. However, if at least half of Title IV funds, which include Pell Grant funds, are going toward programs that fail the earnings premium test, the department would strip all funding from the failing program.\n\nWhile removing Pell eligibility for some failing programs is better than nothing, the two changes could weaken protections for students, Fast said.\n\n\"We're worried that low-income students will exhaust their limited Pell Grant eligibility on programs that don't provide a return on their investment,\" Fast said.\n\nResearch that Fast coauthored, for example, found that in 2022, about 169,000 students received Title IV aid to enroll in programs that would pass the earnings premium test but fail the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nThe department's negotiator said that the gainful employment changes will not be ready by the start of the 2026 academic year, so the new requirements are set to go into effect in the fall of 2027.\n\nLawmakers have previously pushed for a strengthened gainful employment rule. A group of Democratic lawmakers in 2023 called on the Biden administration to put forth a rule that protects students who enroll in \"postsecondary programs that saddle students with unaffordable debt and provide low financial returns.\"",

    "description": "In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he would impose a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has taken another shot at big business, targeting banks this time.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he added. \"Coincidentally, the January 20th date will coincide with the one year anniversary of the historic and very successful Trump Administration.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The president cannot unilaterally impose such a cap; it would require an act of Congress. Similar efforts that have been advanced in Congress have yet to become law.\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, representatives for Chase and Citi pointed to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America. The statement said that the trade organizations \"share the President's goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.\"\n\n\"At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the joint statement read. \"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a jab against the president on X for not yet having introduced a proposal to cap credit card interest — a pledge Trump made during his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders wrote. \"The result? Last year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made $770 million. Unacceptable.\"\n\nIn the first few months of his second term, the Trump administration slashed funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency responsible for protecting consumers by ensuring that financial markets are fair and competitive.\n\nTrump's announcement, made on Truth Social, is the latest in a series of swipes at big business the president has made this week.\n\nEarlier this week, he said that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments. He also said he was barring \"large institutional investors\" from buying up single-family homes and signed an executive order that would limit defense contractors' corporate spending.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

After Trump called on Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips to speak, Rubio could be seen passing a handwritten note to Trump while Vance, 41, seemed to look on with confusion.\n\n\"Marco just gave me a note,\" Trump told the room of executives. Rubio capped his pen and glanced down, but as the president began reading the note aloud, he immediately looked at him.\n\n\"Go back to Chevron,\" Trump read from Rubio's note. \"They want to discuss something. Go back to Chevron.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Vance was clearly amused, laughing on one side of the president as Rubio smiled in apparent discomfort on the other.\n\n\"Go ahead, I'm going back to Chevron,\" Trump said as he placed the note back down on the table.\n\nHe then patted Rubio on the back as he told him, \"Thank you, Marco.\"\n\n\"Was there a question, Mr. President?\" a voice off camera could be heard asking Trump, who then picked up the paper again as he said, \"Yes, go ahead,\" before asking, \"Marco, what was the, what are you saying here?\"\n\nSecretary of energy Chris Wright then took over, asking Mark Nelson of Chevron to share updates from the company. As Nelson spoke, Rubio took the note back and folded it up before tucking it away.\n\nRubio also made headlines in the fall for another note written to Trump, which he gave the president during an Oct. 8, 2025 meeting with conservative influencers and the press.\n\nThe contents of the note, which were captured by photographers in the room, told Trump he needed to approve a statement on social media about a tentative peace agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRubio signaled for Trump's attention during the meeting before sharing the private update with the president concerning the need for him to \"approve\" a social media post, suggesting Trump hadn't written the post himself.\n\nA photo captured by The Associated Press revealed the message, which read: “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Trump quickly told meeting attendees that he had good news.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” he said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”\n\nAP reported at the time that Trump continued the meeting for 10 more minutes before telling the group he had to \"try and solve some problems in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows,” he continued. “We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that.\"",

    "title": "How banning big investors from buying homes could affect prices",
    "description": "Big investors own a small fraction of America's single-family homes. But they're big players in certain Sun Belt markets. Trump wants to ban them.",
    "fullText": "Industry watchers on both sides of the aisle say President Donald Trump's recently announced goal of banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes won't address the root cause of high home prices: a shortage of homes.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nThese mega landlords own only a tiny fraction of the overall US housing market, although they control a significantly larger share of single-family rental homes in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Studies have found that they may have contributed to increased home prices and rents in certain areas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, large investors bought thousands of distressed properties, particularly in Southeastern cities. They correctly predicted that home values and rents in many of the targeted areas would rise over time with population growth.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, and interest rates dropped, investors again snapped up thousands of homes, particularly in cities across the South and Sun Belt. This sparked alarm in communities where individual homebuyers struggled to compete with all-cash offers from major investors.\n\nOverall, large investors own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, large investors have slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. Some major investors have shifted their business model to buying homes in bulk directly from homebuilders, rather than purchasing them one by one.\n\n\"You're seeing this huge increase in debt costs to buy a home, and rents have softened mostly or been flat, and then with prospects of potentially declining home prices, or at least flat home prices, it's just tough,\" said Glenn Hull, CEO of SFR Analytics, which provides software and data tools to real estate investors and others.\n\nInstitutional investors have tended to cluster their purchases, resulting in more concentrated investments in certain neighborhoods in a handful of markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Charlotte, and Tampa. The 2024 GAO report found that they own 25% of single-family rental homes in Atlanta and 21% of those in Jacksonville. Researchers have found that mega landlords may have contributed to the rise in housing costs, particularly in areas where they're heavily concentrated.\n\n\"The studies reviewed by GAO indicate that institutional investment may increase rents and home prices, particularly in places with high rates of institutional ownership,\" the GAO report said. It added that there are some indications that big investors are more likely to file evictions.\n\nStill, the evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\n\"It is unclear whether institutional investors crowd out individual home buyers, and evidence about whether they behave differently than other landlords is thin,\" a 2023 report by the Brookings Institution found.\n\nTo the extent that mega landlords are hurting affordability, it's a local problem in the most affected neighborhoods, industry watchers say.\n\n\"It's not a national story,\" said Jason Lewris, cofounder of Parcl Labs, which tracks institutional investors in housing. \"If you look within those markets, it's a handful of zip codes.\"\n\nMuch remains unknown about what kind of ban Trump intends to pursue. The administration hasn't defined \"large\" institutional investor. Trump said he would ban these investors \"from buying more single-family homes,\" but it's not clear whether they would also be required to sell their current portfolios.\n\nA White House spokesman, Davis Ingle, said in an emailed statement, \"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs.\"\n\nTrump's proposed ban is part of a recent White House effort to address housing affordability concerns. The president announced on Thursday that he's directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds in an attempt to bring down mortgage interest rates.\n\nHousing economists say that banning major investors from buying additional homes would do little to improve affordability.\n\n\"Targeting a small subset of landlords without addressing underlying market conditions and policy gaps will not meaningfully improve the well-being of renters and prospective homebuyers,\" Jenny Schuetz, a former senior fellow focused on housing at the Brookings Institution, told the House Financial Services Committee during a 2022 hearing on corporate investors in residential real estate.\n\nSchuetz, in an interview with Business Insider, called Trump's proposed ban a \"red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nThat's in part because investors don't change the demand for or supply of housing.\n\n\"The housing demand is the same regardless of whether a household rents or buys a home, and housing supply is the same regardless of whether a landlord supplies the unit or a household owns it,\" researchers at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a 2024 report in which they called institutional investors a \"scapegoat\" that distracts from the supply shortage driving higher prices.\n\n\"Periods of rapid rent increases correspond to periods of greater household formation coupled with supply shortages, not institutional investor buyers,\" they added. \"It is hard to argue that institutional rental operators drive up home prices over any reasonable period.\"\n\nInstead, economists argue that an undersupply of homes is the major underlying reason for rising prices.\n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin.\n\nMom-and-pop landlords and other smaller investors own the vast majority of single-family rentals in the US. Stopping a large investor from buying a home doesn't necessarily mean a first-time homebuyer or other individual would end up purchasing the house, Fairweather said. Instead, many of these homes would be snapped up by the main competitors of big investors: smaller landlords.\n\nFrom the tenant's perspective, having a mom-and-pop landlord isn't necessarily better than renting a home from a large investor. And when it comes to enforcing laws that protect tenants, including fair housing laws, it can be easier to prove a pattern of behavior by larger landlords, Fairweather said.\n\nIf the federal government succeeds in passing a ban, enforcing it could be tricky. Large investors could break themselves up into smaller shell companies to avoid the prohibition, Lewris said.\n\nThere are other ways to stop investors from buying up more homes that could be more effective. One alternative is to discourage the behavior by raising property taxes on homes owned by institutional investors, thereby making the practice less lucrative, Hull and Fairweather said.\n\n\"In general, bans don't really work, because people find a way around them,\" Fairweather said, \"but if you tax something, at least you get tax revenue out of it that could be used to support things like first-time homebuyer programs or building more affordable housing.\"\n\nInvestors often argue that they actually boost quality housing options for lower-income people by offering rentals in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Tenants tend to have far lower incomes and wealth than homebuyers. And the neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes often have attractive amenities, including good schools and jobs.\n\n\"The narrative today is that what my business does is wrong, that buying homes and renting them is a bad thing because I'm keeping people from buying homes,\" Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst, a single-family rental company heavily invested in the Sun Belt, said at the real estate conference ResiDay in November 2025. \"It couldn't be any further from the truth, but it's a powerful message.\"\n\nInstead, he argued, his firm helps its tenants live in homes that they couldn't afford a down payment for or wouldn't qualify for a mortgage to buy.\n\nFairweather agreed that banning large landlords from owning single-family homes would mean fewer tenants could live in these wealthier neighborhoods. \"In a way, it boxes out renters and exacerbates some of the inequalities that exist in the country,\" she said.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Trump's plan has already pushed mortgage rates down, but industry experts say they're skeptical of a long-term impact on housing affordability.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump this week has zeroed in on an issue that's at the heart of America's affordability crisis: housing costs.\n\nBut it's not clear if his latest proposal, which involves instructing his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, will move the needle for the housing market in the long run, economists and analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe mortgage-bond purchasing plan, which Trump announced on Truth Social Thursday night, is a lot to grapple with for people unfamiliar with the mortgage market. But the logic behind how this could make buying a home easier goes something like this:\n\nThe plan could have a quantitative easing-like impact on the market, Oliver Allen, a senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told Business Insider. QE refers to the Fed's bond-buying program aimed at adding liquidity to the debt market and stimulating economic activity by encouraging more borrowing. However, the Fed has generally undertaken QE in times of economic turmoil, while Trump is piling into mortgage bonds while the economy is doing pretty well.\n\nThe president's plan has already moved mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped from 6.21% to 5.99% on Friday morning, according to Mortgage News Daily. That's the lowest level in about three years, and experts are optimistic that rates could fall further.\n\nZelman & Associates, a boutique housing research firm, estimated that mortgage rates could fall slightly below 6% under the new MBS purchasing plan, down from its most recent mortgage rate forecast of 6.2% for 2026.\n\nJoel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com, estimated that the purchasing plan could drive mortgage rates as much as 50 basis points.\n\nBut the move might be a one-time drop, and the plan may not alter the picture for housing affordability in the long run, Berner and Allen said.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump meant when he said he told his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The timing and mechanism behind the bond purchases also remain unclear, Zelman & Associates wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nIt's also murky how much of a difference $200 billion will make in the $9 trillion MBS market, analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday. The Fed, for reference, has around $2 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, Realtor.com's Berner said.\n\nThe MBS market is the largest and most liquid in the world after US Treasurys, and buyers are plentiful. Purchasing around 2% of the total outstanding value of bonds in the market might amount to a drop in the bucket a far as impact.\n\n\"Without that same level of scale and credibility, any impact on mortgage rates would likely be modest and short-lived,\" Berner wrote.\n\n\"I don't think this policy on its own can really do very much,\" Allen said.\n\nWhile borrowing costs have been a barrier to homebuyers in recent years, the real issue is supply. A lack of available homes has been the key constraint to truly making housing affordable for more Americans, Berner said. By some estimates, the US is short 5 million homes, or 3.7% of the current supply.\n\nShould rates come down without an increase in housing inventory, that could actually worsen affordability by intensifying competition in the housing market and causing home prices to rise.\n\n\"The long-term real impact is on the supply side. So this demand boost might help in the short run, might boost sales activity, potentially might boost prices or stabilize prices at least, but we don't really see this as a long-run solution,\" Berner told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think even if you can nudge down mortgage rates at the margin, you're still going to have very high home prices and very stretched affordability as a result,\" Allen said.\n\nTaken along with Trump's ban on large investors buying single-family homes, the MBS plan shows that the administration is keenly aware that affordability is an issue for many Americans—and a potential political liability as the midterms approach.\n\nHousing has been a crucial focus for Trump all throughout his second term, but the president's zeal for making housing cheaper appears to have picked up as campaign season approaches, Allen noted.\n\n\"They're throwing a lot of darts at the board right now,\" Berner said, referring to the president's other initiatives, like introducing a 50-year mortgage and banning big investors from purchasing homes. \"I think they're just trying to pull out all the stops.\"",

    "title": "Why Trump is suing The New York Times — and giving them 2-hour interviews",
    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "description": ": Just refreshed to avoid 5G interference? Do it again, FAA tells industry, as Upper C-band auction looms",
    "fullText": "Airlines operating in the US may have to upgrade their aircraft radio altimeters again at a cost of billions of dollars, to avoid potential interference with cell networks following the Trump administration's decision last year to auction off additional spectrum to bidders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice of proposed new regulations. If implemented, these will require all radio altimeters to meet specific minimum performance requirements.\n\nThose requirements are for altimeters to able to withstand interference from wireless signals in neighboring spectrum bands, while continuing to provide accurate altitude readings to both pilots and integrated aircraft safety systems.\n\nAnd the cost for all this? The FAA estimates the total bill to retrofit aircraft with interference-tolerant altimeters will be $4.49 billion, or $424 million annualized at a 7 percent discount rate over 20 years.\n\nAccording to the FAA, the blame for this move lies with the Trump administration and its US budget bill signed into law last year that directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open up more radio frequencies to be auctioned off for commercial use.\n\nThis sell-off must include at least 100 MHz and possibly as much as 180 MHz of the 3.98 to 4.2 GHz band (Upper C-band), which the FCC intends to make available for terrestrial wireless flexible use, as disclosed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [PDF] last year.\n\nHowever, aircraft radio altimeter (RA) systems operate in the adjacent 4.2 to 4.4-GHz band, and the FAA is clearly worried about the possibility of interference if cellular network operators start using the Upper C-band to deliver services.\n\n\"FAA expects future wireless services in the Upper C-band aligned with service rules in the Lower C-band to cause interference to current RA systems. Existing RA systems are not compatible with this envisioned use, and airworthiness directives issued by FAA in 2023 are insufficient to address the unsafe condition that will result from wireless services in the Upper C-band,\" the agency says in its proposal document.\n\nWireless service providers have already taken voluntary measures in the proximity of airports, the FAA says, but these commitments will hit a sunset date at the start of 2028 unless extended by mutual agreement, and long-term compatibility between Lower C-band wireless services and RA systems has not been resolved beyond that date.\n\nIt believes that a single retrofit of RA systems will be able to address compatibility issues with wireless services in both the Lower and Upper C-band, and says the aviation industry has been working to develop standards for next-generation RA systems for several years now.\n\nThe deadline for making these changes is proposed to coincide with the FCC's date authorizing the initiation of new wireless services in the Upper C-band, which the FAA currently expects to be sometime between 2029 and 2032.\n\nThis isn't the first time this issue has arisen. Back in 2021, The Register reported that the FAA was concerned enough to consider restricting flights once 5G services were up and running. European aviation regulators declared that this wasn't an issue on their side of the Atlantic, however.\n\nThe solution from the FAA back then was also to replace the affected RA systems, and the agency set a deadline of February 1, 2024 for all updates to be carried out. It later declared that, as of the end of September 2023, the entire US airline fleet had upgraded their equipment and the risk of 5G interference had been mitigated.\n\nUntil last year, of course, when the newly installed Trump administration decided to start re-allocating spectrum in order to generate more revenue from license fees.\n\nThe FAA's notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) document is open for comments for 60 days, a period that ends on March 9.\n\nA spokesperson for Airlines for America - a trade association for US passenger and cargo airlines - sent a statement to The Register:\n\n\"We have been working collaboratively with the telecommunications industry, the FAA and the FCC to identify solutions that ensure our nation's airspace remains safe while allowing the spectrum to be used.\n\n\"We were expecting this NPRM, which was published to fulfill requirements included in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and are currently evaluating all of the details in the proposal and will be providing comments.\"\n\nThe Reg also asked International Air Transport Association (IATA) for comment. ®",

    "fullText": "Secret Service code names, which Secret Service agents use when communicating about the security of the first family, are among the worst-kept secrets in Washington.\n\nThough they're meant to be secret, the code names quickly become public either through government filings, sources who leak them to news outlets, or when agents are overheard at public events. Since new technology has allowed security agents to monitor officials in a variety of ways, the names aren't so top-secret anymore.\n\nThe White House Communications Agency assigns each member of the first family a code name for Secret Service agents to use during their time in the White House. These names come from a list of agency-approved choices that either the president chooses from or agents pick.\n\nOther members of the family are then assigned names that share the same first letter. Sometimes, it's the same letter as the family's last name, but not always.\n\nHere are the Secret Service code names used by the past 12 presidents and first ladies.\n\nKennedy's code name harkens back to Lancelot, one of King Arthur's heroic Knights of the Round Table. After his death, Jacqueline Kennedy popularized the moniker \"Camelot\" in reference to his presidency.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's code name was fitting for her image as one of the most elegant residents in the history of the White House, who wore lace for her high-profile wedding and during events like a widely covered state visit to France.\n\nJohnson kept the same Secret Service code name that he used as Kennedy's vice president.\n\nLady Bird Johnson was a woman of many names. Her birth name was Claudia Alta Taylor, but a nursemaid nicknamed her Lady Bird, according to the White House Historical Association. To the Secret Service, she was known as Victoria.\n\nNixon's given code name adds an ironic tinge to his legacy in the context of the night raid that set off the Watergate scandal and led to his resignation.\n\nPat Nixon chose the code name \"Starlight,\" corresponding to her husband's choice of \"Searchlight.\"\n\nFord used the same Secret Service code name when he served as vice president under Nixon.\n\nA pinafore is a type of women's dress, but Betty Ford famously wore pants while dancing on top of the Cabinet Room table on her last day as first lady in 1977.\n\nCarter's open devotion to his Christian faith made this codename spot-on. After his retirement from politics, Carter even spent time teaching Sunday school.\n\nRosalynn Carter also used the code name \"Lotus Petal.\"\n\nThe former actor had appeared as a cowboy on-screen, but Reagan's passion for all things Western also shaped his image as president.\n\nThe code name \"Rainbow\" was a nod to Nancy Reagan's affinity for wearing bright colors.\n\nSome of Bush's Secret Service agents served as pallbearers at his funeral in 2018, AP reported.\n\nAfter her death, former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow wrote for CNN that her code name \"exemplified her demeanor and its calming, humanizing and gentle effect on those around her.\"\n\nThough he never reached the rank of Eagle during his time as a Boy Scout, Clinton was given the patriotic code name.\n\nHillary Clinton's codename used during the 2016 presidential election was the same security code name that she had during her time in the White House.\n\nBush originally used the code name \"Tumbler\" when his father was president. It was changed to \"Trailblazer\" when he became president.\n\nThe Bushes' twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, went by the code names \"Turquoise\" and Twinkle.\"\n\nThough the name matched the bold optimism of Obama's campaign, the president reportedly just chose his favorite from an approved list of proposed words that started with the letter \"r.\"\n\nThe Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, were known as \"Radiance\" and \"Rosebud.\"\n\nBiden's Secret Service code name served as a tribute to his Irish Catholic heritage. He also used the code name \"Celtic\" as vice president.\n\nJill Biden also kept her Secret Service code name from her time as second lady.\n\nThough he said in a 2015 candidate debate that he would choose the name \"Humble\" for himself, the one he was ultimately assigned was likely inspired by decades spent in a real-estate dynasty handed down from his father. Trump has used the same code name during both of his terms.\n\nIt's been suggested the first lady's name refers to her career in front of the camera as a model in New York City before she met her mogul husband.\n\nThe name of Melania Trump's production company, Muse Films, is a nod to her Secret Service code name. Muse Films will release the documentary \"MELANIA,\" which chronicles the lead-up to Trump's 2025 inauguration, on January 30.",

The increase was less than expected. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.4%.\n\nHistorically, presidents are briefed a day ahead of the report's publication. By protocol, the president and White House staff are not supposed to comment on the report until it is released.\n\nEconomist Justin Wolfers called the episode \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"No White House has ever before leaked such important market-moving numbers,\" Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, wrote on X. \"No serious country does this.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nTrump had a similar episode during his first term.

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its next rulings on January 14 as several major cases remain pending including the legality ​of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe court indicated on its website on Friday that ‌it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday. The court ‌does not announce in advance what cases will be decided.\n\nThe justices issued one ruling on Friday in a criminal case.\n\nThe challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to ⁠office in January 2025. The outcome ‌will also impact the global economy.\n\nDuring arguments in the case heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the ‍legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.\n\nTrump has said tariffs have made the United ​States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ‌ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl ⁠and illicit drugs into the United States as a national ​emergency.\n\nThe challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the ​Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.\n\nOther important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which ‍has a 6-3 conservative majority, ⁠including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting.\n\nAnother involves a challenge on free ⁠speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting \"conversion therapy\" that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation ‌or gender identity.",

    "description": "White House officials believe that Marjorie Taylor Greene may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Donald Trump's dinner plans last September.",
    "fullText": "White House officials believe that former congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the superfan-turned-intraparty foe of President Donald Trump, may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Trump’s dinner plans last September.\n\nAccording to Axios’s Alex Isenstadt, a “chaotic confrontation” between Code Pink protesters and Trump at Joe’s Seafood, a Washington, D.C., restaurant that Greene had recommended to the commander-in-chief, “embarrassed the president and intensified concerns in the White House about his safety.”\n\nOfficials told the Secret Service that they suspected that Greene may have informed Code Pink of Trump’s intention of dining at Joe’s that evening.\n\nPer Isenstadt, the White House’s theory relies on two pillars:\n\n1. Her suggesting where Trump should dine\n\nOfficials say that after recommending the president go to Joe’s, Greene repeatedly called White House staffers the day of the dinner to confirm he was going.\n\nAfter Trump heard about Greene’s calls, he called her shortly before leaving the White House and confirmed his planned visit, the sources said.\n\nGreene — who was a regular at the restaurant — didn’t show up there when Trump and other officials were there, which struck some Trump aides as odd.\n\n2. Greene’s relationship with Code Pink\n\nWhite House aides note Greene is friends with Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin.\n\nGreene and the organization are aligned in their opposition to the U.S. providing military aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nBenjamin last year praised Greene for opposing Trump’s bombing of nuclear sites in Iran and for calling to strip foreign aid from the Pentagon’s budget.\n\nBoth Greene and Code Pink denied the accusation. The former told Axios that the charge is “an absolute lie, a dangerous lie,” and insisted that while she recommended the establishment to Trump, she didn’t know when he might go.\n\n“That absolutely did not happen, to the point it is comical,” commented Code Pink’s Melissa Garriga.\n\nTrump criticized Greene in a November Oval Office Q&A after Greene broke with him on a number of hot-button issues.\n\n“Yeah, so I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think,” said Trump at the time. “when somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s now catering to the other side—I don’t know what, you know, I guess she’s got some kind of an act going—but I’m surprised at her. But when somebody like Marjorie goes over and starts making statements like that, it shows she doesn’t know.”\n\nThe feud only escalated from there.\n\nThe post White House Reportedly Suspects Marjorie Taylor Greene Tipped Off Left-Wing Protesters About Trump Dinner Plans first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\"",
    "fullText": "As a neurologist, I care for some of society’s most vulnerable individuals — children with severe disabilities who are often mocked, dismissed or misunderstood. My career is rooted in supporting people with physical and cognitive differences, educating about empathy and respect for human diversity, and applying the principles of science and medicine to improve the lives of those facing challenges of one kind or another.\n\nFrom that perspective, President Donald Trump’s public admonition of a female reporter in November — “Quiet, piggy” — was gut-wrenching and continues to resonate weeks later. To some, it was an offhand, albeit misogynistic, fat-shaming insult. To me, the remark instantly evoked Piggy, the vulnerable and marginalized character in William Golding’s novel “Lord of the Flies” and revealed something far more troubling: a display of dominance, denigration and the subjugation of those deemed less worthy.\n\nAlso Read: After My Baby Died, I Saw 4 Words On A Standard Form At The Doctor's Office That Stopped Me Cold\n\nThe rapid spread of the phrase across media platforms underscored a deeper danger — one that has only grown more unsettling as public displays of intimidation and condemnation increase. It is not just the cruelty of the words but the authority of the speaker, and the delight of many in his audience, that makes them so corrosive.\n\nAs some media outlets bow to Trump, HuffPost won’t back down. We’re committed to relentlessly reporting on his actions and holding power accountable every step of the way. Support fearless journalism — join our membership program today.\n\n“Quiet, piggy” is not a joke. It is an illustration of how normalized bullying has become, and an affront to the people I care for and the values that guide my work.\n\nOthers have drawn parallels between “Lord of the Flies” and our political moment. In 2020, The New York Times published Jennifer Finney Boylan’s essay “President of the Flies,” in which she described feeling cast onto “some cruel and hostile strand ... where people with disabilities were mocked, immigrants ... were reviled, and grabbing women by their private parts was ... A-OK.”\n\nHealth: Therapists Warn This Normalized Trump Behavior Is Causing Real-World Harm\n\nBoylan compared the “Flies” boys’ descent into savagery with a society in which democratic norms erode, expertise is dismissed and cruelty is sanctioned. Her metaphor captured profound moral decay and warned of the danger of unchecked power divorced from reason, science and shared truth.\n\nYet even as Boylan wrote, darker chapters still lay ahead: the attack on the U.S. Capitol; the dismantling of asylum protections; and the normalization of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics stripping primarily people of color of due process. What began as boasts about grabbing women’s bodies metastasized into a broader posture of possession — an expanding sense of what can be seized without consequence: democratic institutions, marginalized populations beyond our borders and — most recently — entire territories and nations framed as objects to be claimed. Golding captured this descent in “Lord of the Flies,” where casual cruelty gradually hardens into loss of restraint and hunger for control.\n\nThese events raise a troubling question: What has become of a society that greets such assertions of entitlement with indifference — or even approval? When the targets are distant, vulnerable or politically inconvenient, outrage seems to dissipate. Increasingly, the United States feels less like a democratic exemplar than a cautionary tale of how quickly ethical bearings can be lost.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, Piggy is intelligent, physically fragile and socially marginalized. He is mocked — and ultimately killed — for the very qualities that make him indispensable. When his glasses, the symbol of knowledge and reason, are shattered, civilization collapses into savagery.\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\nThe parallels today are difficult to ignore. Scientific expertise is ridiculed. Anti-vaccine rhetoric is elevated. Universities are portrayed as threats. Books are banned, history sanitized and facts themselves rendered suspect. Like Piggy’s broken glasses, our collective means of illumination is being smashed.\n\nAs a physician, I see the consequences of this erosion. Public health experts are harassed. Families distrust lifesaving medical advice. Vulnerable children absorb a cultural message that intellect and difference make them contemptible. What makes this moment especially dangerous is not merely who initiates the cruelty but who echoes it.\n\nIn “Lord of the Flies,” it is not Jack, the overt villain, who says “Quiet, Piggy,” but Ralph, the boy aligned with order and conscience. This is the moral creep Boylan warned about: the moment when those who believe themselves principled begin to accommodate degradation. That is what made the aftermath of this remark so disturbing. Piggy memes spread widely — not only among Trump supporters, but among critics and political leaders who claim to reject his politics. The very behaviors we teach children to avoid — mockery, humiliation, ridicule — have become entertainment, modeled by adults in positions of authority.\n\nThis casual embrace of cruelty — and the willingness to look away as acts of intimidation, coercion and lawlessness accumulate — reveals something deeper. “Quiet, piggy” conveys that bullying is acceptable, vulnerability is shameful, intellect is unwelcome and force — not dialogue — is the currency of public life. It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\n\nAlso Read: My Parents Wanted To Adopt More Kids — After I Started Having My Own. Here's What I Didn't Expect To Feel.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, the Beast is an imagined external threat, but it is Simon who speaks the most unsettling truth before he, too, is murdered: “Maybe there is a beast. Maybe it’s only us.”\n\nThe greatest danger is not a single leader, but a collective moral drift — a human capacity for dehumanization when norms collapse. Leaders do not invent this darkness; they unlock it.\n\nWe are not innocent bystanders. History shows where dehumanization leads — not through lone tyrants, but through ordinary people who acclimate to the erosion of decency. Like Golding’s boys, we have shown ourselves willing to normalize cruelty, relish humiliation and allow the expanding reach of those in power to go unchallenged. We cannot reclaim innocence, but as professionals, parents, educators and voters, we can resist the further unraveling of our civic soul.\n\nAlso Read: What’s The Secret To A Longer Life?

    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "description": "The Treasury Secretary said that Trump's proposal to keep big players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell current holdings.",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump's proposal to keep Wall Street players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said on Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would ban institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes in an effort to make housing more affordable for Americans. Single-family homes refer to standalone residential buildings with their own entrance designed for one household.\n\n\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nShares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6% on Wednesday after Trump's post. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up. Blackstone closed 1.1% higher at the end of the trading day on Thursday.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nIn Minnesota on Thursday, Bessent said that the administration has not decided on the \"exact contours\" of this new proposal.\n\n\"We want to keep the traditional mom and pop owners in. We want to keep families who rent out to their other family members,\" he said.\n\nBessent said that this practice of large firms buying up single-family homes started during the 2008 financial crisis, when private equity companies were among the few parties with the money to buy these homes.\n\n\"They hoovered up the single-family housing stock,\" he said.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office found that in 2022, the five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of single-family rental homes.",
