    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",

    "description": "Major indexes rose on Friday, with investors looking past a weak GDP report after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's tariffs are illegal.",
    "fullText": "Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.\n\nUS stocks reversed earlier losses after the Supreme Court struck down the sweeping trade policy the president unveiled last April. The decision is a major update to an issue that's been a source of intense uncertainty and volatility for much of the last year, and will also raise new questions about how Trump might pursue his landmark policy push.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around noon ET on Friday:\n\nThe news on tariffs outweighed a disappointing update on economic growth, while PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, heated up faster than expected. GDP grew 1.4% year-over-year last quarter, falling far short of estimates, while PCE rose 0.4% in December, slightly above the anticipated 0.3% gain.\n\n\"The market just totally erupted,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider. \"In the short run, it's good for corporate earnings.\"\n\nHere are four big takeaways for investors.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Trump's ability to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that allows the president to regulate economic activity in emergency events.\n\nBut there are a handful of other legal avenues the president could use to try to impose tariffs again, according to Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The Trump administration can impose pretty much the equivalent levies if they so wish to, which you'd imagine they do,\" he told Business Insider, adding that his outlook on US trade policy hadn't changed significantly over the long term.\n\n\"The president has already signalled that he will quickly pivot to other legal tools to achieve similar trade restrictions, and he has at his disposal multiple levers to pull in order to circumvent the verdict,\" Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at Ebury, wrote on Friday, adding that Trump's longer-term strategy for tariffs was \"unlikely to be derailed.\"\n\n\"The ball is now in the administration's court—specifically the willingness and ability to impose tariffs under alternative legal authorities,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a top economist and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in a post on X.\n\nShould Trump impose new tariffs, it's likely that import duties will be lower due to the legal precedent set by the SCOTUS ruling, according to Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"In particular, it will be harder for the White House to impose tariffs without clear justification and due process. Businesses and consumers will get more clarity and lower rates going forward,\" Long wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nThe positive market reaction on Friday suggests that investors think tariff refunds are a possibility, according to Pepperstone's Brown.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, said he believed the US would likely issue between $100 billion and $130 billion in tariff refunds.\n\n\"When one thinks about the fiscal tailwind that may inject $100-150 billion in cash to American households this year in addition to tariff refunds we are talking real money,\" he wrote in a post on X, referring to the amount households are expected to get in tax refunds this year.\n\nIt's unclear how the refunds, if the US will issue any, will work, Long said.\n\n\"The refund process will be a mess,\" she wrote. \"It's likely the White House will fight against issuing refunds at all.\n\nBond yields ticked higher shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, a sign that concerns are beginning to swell over the US debt picture again, now that tariff revenue, for the moment, has been taken off the table.\n\n\"Tariffs had been functioning as a shadow tax that helped fund spending without explicitly raising taxes. Remove that and the deficit widens, borrowing rises, and historically that is the type of development that leans on the bond market and pressures yields higher,\" Mark Malek, the CIO of Siebert Financial, wrote in a note on Friday.",

    "title": "Now That Trump's Tariffs Have Been Ruled Illegal, Will Tech Prices Lower?",
    "description": "It's not clear whether prices will come down now that these tariffs are ending.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The Supreme Court struck down the president's signature economic orders on Friday in a 6-3 ruling, spelling the end of a controversial policy that added an estimated $1,000 tax increase for each American household, raised prices on consumer goods, and alienated key U.S. allies.\n\nNot all of Trump's tariffs need to end because of this ruling. The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "description": "President Trump was the first to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.\n\n“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision on Friday left uncertain the extent to which those who paid tariffs might be able to obtain refunds, with Justice Kavanaugh warning that any refund process could be a substantial “mess.”\n\nThe United States “may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid” the tariffs, he wrote, “even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.”\n\nThe court’s ruling, backed by justices from across the ideological spectrum, was a rare and significant example of the Supreme Court pushing back on Mr. Trump’s agenda. Since he returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority had overwhelmingly issued emergency orders allowing the president to carry out his policies on a temporary basis. But the decision on Friday will have a more lasting impact.\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees — Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Chief Justice Roberts and the three liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump called the Supreme Court’s ruling “a disgrace” while speaking to the nation’s governors on Friday, according to two people familiar with his comments.\n\nEarly last year, Mr. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations.\n\nA dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing.\n\nPratik Shah, the lead lawyer for the toy company, said in a statement that the justices had “upheld the foundational separation-of-powers principle that our small-business client has been fighting for: no president has boundless power to tax Americans.”\n\nIn court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has collected roughly $240 billion in tariff revenue since April 2, 2025 labeled “Liberation Day,” by President Trump. The research firm Capital Economics estimated that if the Treasury is forced to issue refunds, the cost would run to about $120 billion or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nBut even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law.\n\nMr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThe affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nDuring oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers.\n\nIn its 21-page opinion, the majority said it was telling that for half a century, no other president had invoked the statute to impose “any tariffs — let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.”\n\nThe two words “regulate” and “importation,” the court said, do not give the president the power to “impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.”\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the president’s use of the statute had run afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch. The court relied on the same doctrine to strike down President Joseph R. Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe three liberal justices agreed with the overall ruling, but insisted the same result could have been reached without applying the doctrine, which they have been critical of in the past.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a lengthy and forceful separate opinion agreeing that Mr. Trump had overstepped his authority and defending Congress as the proper branch to impose taxes.\n\n“Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” he wrote. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Kavanaugh said the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs and noted that they had helped the administration negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars.\n\nEven so, Justice Kavanaugh laid out other ways the president could set duties through different federal statutes.\n\n“So the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward,” he wrote. “But the court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.\n\nAbbie VanSickle Tyler Pager and @Patti Cohen contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "MAGA’s hate machine is—at least temporarily—sputtering.\n\nOn Monday, late-night host Stephen Colbert attempted to interview Texas Senate hopeful James Talarico. Instead of this being a routine nothing-to-write-home-about few minutes chat with a little-known Texas state representative, Colbert ran into a legal wall: CBS’s attorneys told the broadcaster to pull the interview after Trump’s FCC argued that late-night-show interviews of political candidates from one party but not the other violate federal regulations. The network allegedly advised the host that he shouldn’t even discuss on-air that it had put the kibosh on the interview.\n\nColbert wasn’t amused. Not only did he proceed to talk about it on the air; he interviewed Talarico and posted it on YouTube, where, within two days, the clip had garnered some 7.8 million views.\n\nA week ago, polls showed Representative Jasmine Crockett leading Talarico by eight points. If Talarico ends up winning his primary in Texas and then goes on to win the general election against the front-runner to be the GOP’s nominee, Texas’s far-right attorney general, Ken Paxton—who avoided a likely conviction for securities fraud two years ago by taking a plea bargain and agreeing to do community service—he will have Trump’s anti–First Amendment FCC to thank for his meteoric rise to national prominence.\n\nPolling conducted before the Colbert interview of a hypothetical Talarico-Paxton matchup shows the race to be a toss-up. And now CBS’s pandering to the Trump administration over the Colbert interview has given the Democrat a crucial publicity boost just as early voting in the March 3 primaries gets underway. Indeed, many of the more than 65,000 commenters on the YouTube video specifically thanked the FCC for bringing the interview, and the candidate, to their attention.\n\n“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights,” Talarico explained to Colbert, in reacting to the attempts to censor him. The audience roared its approval. For the next 14 minutes, Talarico hit rhetorical home run after home run, denouncing the hypocrisies of Christian Nationalism—“people baptizing their partisanship and calling that Christianity”—attacking the xenophobia of the MAGA movement, and explaining how the real fight in America is “not left versus right; it’s top versus bottom.” That’s as succinct a summary of the problem of oligarchy as any I have heard.\n\nOver the last few weeks, there has been something remarkably ham-handed and asinine about the authoritarianism that Trump 2.0 is serving up. The ambition remains. The administration is still trying to curtail free speech, chill political participation, and take over election processes in the run-up to the November vote, but some of the enthusiasm and efficiency of the administration that we saw last year seems to have at least temporarily dissipated.\n\nSince the Department of Homeland Security announced that the ICE surge in Minneapolis was ending, Stephen Miller, the most outspoken proponent of Trump’s might-is-right worldview, has been remarkably silent. Greg Bovino, the Gestapo-trenchcoat-wearing public face of ICE, has largely vanished from view. (Bovino was last seen with some drinking buddies being unceremoniously kicked out of a bar on the Las Vegas strip.)\n\nKristi Noem also went largely silent, though in her case she couldn’t quite go a whole week without doing something blitheringly stupid, entirely offensive, cruel, or patently unconstitutional. At a press conference, she announced that the blizzard of federal investigations into alleged voter fraud were intended to “make sure we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.” Someone apparently forgot to give her the memo that you don’t say the really undemocratic stuff out loud. And later in the week, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a memo announcing that refugees in the United States who hadn’t gotten their green card within one year of arrival would be subject to arrest and detention. As for Trump’s lapdog attorney general, Pam Bondi, after the debacle of her congressional hearing, she has apparently decided to hide under the tranche of Epstein documents that, drip by drip, leak by leak, are corroding what remains of the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n\nEven Trump’s social media presence has become tired and formulaic. When Winter Olympics athlete Hunter Hess said that representing Trump’s United States “brings up mixed emotions,” the narcissist in chief took time out from his busy day to post on Truth Social, “U.S. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn’t represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe post was so boring that Hess didn’t even mention Trump in his reply. “There is so much that is great about America, but there are always things that could be better,” the athlete wrote. “One of the many things that makes this country so amazing is that we have the right and the freedom to point that out.” Apparently, in between his training sessions on the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, Hess attended the high school civics lesson on the First Amendment that the Trump team all skipped out on.\n\nOf course, by next week the sundowning authoritarian may have pushed the United States into an avoidable forever war with the Iranians, and with the help of GOP governors in key states such as Texas and Florida, he may have escalated his efforts to sabotage the midterm elections. In fact, if I were a betting man, I’d say the odds were pretty high on both of those fronts. But given the horrors we are living through, I’ll take small graces where I can. For now, at least some of the air seems to have gone out of Trump—and when push comes to shove, a deflated, tired Trump, despite all the military hardware at his fingertips, is simply a nasty, trash-talking, increasingly addled old man.",

    "description": "In truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground.",
    "fullText": "To stay up to date with all Jurisprudence news, please \n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.\n\nIn truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nRoberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”\n\nCongress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.\n\nAnother clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.\n\nThere was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.\n\nShould we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.\n\nBut we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "description": "Hess found himself in the middle of a firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics after comments he made regarding representing the U.S. in the current political climate.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.\n\n\"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama \"gave classified information\" and wasn't \"supposed to be doing that,\" adding that he could get him \"out of trouble\" by declassifying the relevant files.\n\nObama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are \"real\" and that they're not \"being kept\" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens \"have made contact with us.\"\n\nAliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.\n\nOn the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nOne of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.\n\nBetting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.\n\nPolymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.\n\nIf the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.\n\nIn November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.\n\nThe mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.\n\nAt that time, Trump said the government \"knows what is happening\" but wasn't sharing it.\n\n\"For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Something strange is going on,\" he added.\n\nA Facebook group titled \"New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it\" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.",

Since the 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off in Milan earlier this month, MAGA has been melting down at U.S. Olympians who have spoken about their complicated feelings representing the country on the world stage, following Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deadly operations. Evita Duffy-Alfonso, the eldest of Duffy’s nine children with wife Fox News weekend host Rachel Campos-Duffy, took MAGA’s criticism even further, suggesting that athletes should be screened for “their patriotism.”",

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.\n\nThe PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.\n\nThe investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.\n\nThe department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.\n\n“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.\n\nMany of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”\n\nThe PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.\n\n“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”\n\nThe group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.\n\nMIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.\n\nThe University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.\n\n“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.\n\nThe University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.\n\nOut of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.\n\nThe Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”\n\nThe administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A large banner featuring Donald Trump's face was hung on the exterior of Justice Department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the Republican president's efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.\n\nWhile Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department's tradition of independence from White House control.\n\nThe banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has postured herself as the president's chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nTrump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the Justice Department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.\n\nThe Justice Department in a statement Thursday said it is proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction.”\n\nThe Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president's perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.\n\nFederal prosecutors brought charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Comey said the banner was “sickening to see,” adding that the administration \"forgot to cover the inscription” on one side of the building that says, “Where law ends tyranny begins.\"\n\nThe department is also investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.",

    "title": "Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.",
    "description": "The consequences of this shift are not abstract.",
    "fullText": "During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.\n\nNow, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.\n\nBut now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.\n\nThis issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.\n\nI know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.\n\nThis is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.\n\nThe moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration has issued a sweeping new order that could lead to the arrest of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the United States but do not yet have permanent residency, overturning years of legal and immigration safeguards.\n\nA memo filed by the Department of Homeland Security ahead of a Thursday federal court hearing in Minnesota says refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. for review of their applications.\n\nDHS “may maintain custody for the duration of the inspection and examination process,” said the memo, which was filed Wednesday.\n\nAdvocacy and resettlement groups slammed the order, which will likely face legal challenges and could sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of immigration restrictions by the Trump administration, which has upended longstanding policies toward refugees, including dramatically reducing the number admitted into the country. A memo obtained by The Associated Press late last year said the administration was planning a review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, and immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who arrived during those years.\n\nThe administration has cited national security and economic concerns for its changed policies. Experts say refugees let into the country already undergo extensive vetting.\n\nThe new order came hours before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim heard arguments Thursday on whether he should extend a temporary order that protects Minnesota refugees lawfully in the U.S. from being arrested and deported. Tunheim’s order applies only in Minnesota, but the implications of the new national policy was a major part of the discussion anyway.\n\nHow many people could be arrested under the new order was unclear.\n\nJustice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during Thursday's hearing that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but indicated that would not always happen.\n\n“That's a discretion call for DHS to make,” he said, a comment met with skepticism by attorneys for the Minnesota refugees.\n\nTunheim did not rule Thursday, saying he’d issue a written decision on whether the temporary order would be extended.\n\nAfter the hearing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said at a news conference outside the courthouse that the government \"failed to offer any coherent argument for their policy in either law or fact.” She wasn’t in court for the hearing, but said she'd been briefed about it.\n\n“And so we will continue the fight for justice in the courts,” Smith said, flanked by attorneys and refugee rights supporters, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nImmigration advocates quickly pushed back against the new policy, with HIAS, an international Jewish nonprofit serving refugees and asylum-seekers, calling it “a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed.”\n\n“They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention,\" Beth Oppenheim, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nTunheim blocked the government from targeting the Minnesota refugees last month, saying the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claims “that their arrest and detention, and the policy that purports to justify them, are unlawful.” His Jan. 28 temporary restraining order will expire Feb. 25 unless he grants a more permanent preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge previously rejected the government’s claim that it had the legal right to arrest and detain refugees who haven’t obtained their green cards within a year of arriving in the U.S.\n\n“Mandating detention would lead to an illogical result,” Tunheim wrote, since refugees can’t even apply for green cards until they’ve been in the U.S. for a year. The government's interpretation, he said, means nearly all refugees would face detention unless immigration officials conducted their review at exactly the one-year mark, which he called “nonsensical.”\n\nRefugee rights groups sued the federal government in January after the government launched Operation PARRIS, an acronym for Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening.\n\nIt was billed as a “sweeping initiative” to reexamine the cases of 5,600 Minnesota refugees who had not yet been granted permanent resident status, or green cards. The agencies cited fraud in public programs in Minnesota as justification.\n\nOperation PARRIS was part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targeting Minnesota, including a surge of thousands of federal officers. Homeland Security called it the largest immigration enforcement operation ever. It sparked mass protests after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens. White House border czar Tom Homan announced last week the surge was ending, though a small federal presence would remain.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE officers went door to door under Operation PARRIS arresting refugees and sending them to detention centers in Texas, without access to attorneys. Some were later released in Texas and left to find their own way back to Minnesota, they said.\n\nTunheim noted in his order that refugees are extensively vetted by multiple agencies before being resettled in the U.S. He wrote that none arrested in the operation had been deemed a danger to the community or a flight risk, nor had any been charged with crimes that could be grounds for deportation.\n\nTunheim stressed that the refugees impacted by his order were admitted into the U.S. because of persecution in their home countries. He prohibited further arrests under Operation PARRIS and ordered that detainees still in custody from it be released and returned to Minnesota.\n\n“They are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border. Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s top aides have warned his administration to stay on message as the midterm elections approach in a bid to counter the president’s unpredictable behavior and tendency to go wildly off-script.\n\nAt a strategy session for dozens of administration officials on Tuesday night, the president’s inner circle also acknowledged that affordability would remain a major issue for voters, especially if they didn’t feel the gains Trump often talks about.\n\nThe meeting, on Capitol Hill, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, with presentations by her deputy, James Blair, and GOP veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio.\n\nAnd while Trump was not in the room, his longstanding concern—that it is rare for the president’s party to win in midterm elections—was front and center, according to sources.\n\nDuring the two-hour session, Blair, a 36-year-old former political consultant, presented historical trends to this effect.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Trump could be unpredictable and was likely to say and do as he pleased, without necessarily focusing on data. Therefore, he said, it was crucial for everyone else to remain on message, disciplined, and data-driven as the campaign ramped up.\n\nHe also suggested that there was no point in talking about wages going up (something that Trump cites regularly) unless voters feel the impacts of the administration’s economic achievements.\n\nA similar challenge confronted former President Joe Biden, who repeatedly touted the value of so-called “Bidenomics”—even as millions of Americans struggled with cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe session, which took place at Washington’s Capitol Hill Club, was attended by dozens of administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThey were told that they would be required to be more active as surrogates for the midterms, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with a third of the seats in the 100-member Senate.\n\nLosing in November could ultimately dent Trump’s legislative agenda for the next two years and result in articles of impeachment against him and members of his Cabinet.\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot for the midterms, Wiles revealed last year that the White House had shifted its strategy and would make him “campaign like it’s 2024” in the hope that more voters would turn out for the GOP.\n\n“Typically in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting at the White House—you localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” she told conservative group Moms of America.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nBut the president faces a number of headwinds ahead of November, from sinking approval ratings and a fracturing MAGA base, as well as firestorms on everything from the Epstein files to ICE and immigration.\n\nHis bombastic tendency to go wildly off-script is also an issue, such as describing affordability as a “con job” or claiming that the Epstein files are a Democratic “hoax”.\n\nFabrizio took the group through a series of data outlining the issues that matter to voters in targeted seats, with the economy being the top-tier issue, which he said resonated more than border security.\n\nHe also suggested focusing more on podcasts and social media, rather than traditional interviews and news outlets, to get the message out.\n\nBut whether a more disciplined approach will be enough to counter the president’s unpredictability is yet to be seen, according to some Republicans.\n\n“If they stay on message, it’s a good thing,” said Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon. “They get sidetracked… they’ve got to stay focused.”\n\nCritics have also accused Trump of “gaslighting” Americans by trying to spotlight affordability and drug prices on the campaign trail.\n\n“Trump running on affordability is laughable,” said Protect Our Care president Brad Woodhouse.\n\n“Republican policies have only made life more expensive for hard-working families, and nothing has made that more clear than the GOP’s catastrophic cuts to health care.”",

    "fullText": "Late last year, as a US government shutdown cut off the Snap benefits that low-income families rely on for groceries, videos on social media cast the fallout in frantic scenes. “Imma keep it real with you,” a Black woman said in a viral TikTok post, “I get over $2,500 a month in stamps. I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.\n\nVisible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox News reported on the Snap deepfakes as if they were authentic, before issuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt claimed people were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americans make up 37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)\n\nThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.\n\nCoined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.\n\n“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”\n\nDuring memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.\n\nThe Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video app Sora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism to sully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King and Charlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.\n\nInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted a doctored photo of Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying the Obamas as apes was circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.\n\nBlackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn their heyday, minstrel shows were the dominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,” explained Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.\n\nEven as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’s Joy Buolamwini were sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.\n\nTech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled a tempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos, to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.\n\nBlack in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.\n\n“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”\n\nAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by the Trump administration highlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.\n\nBeyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”\n\nEven so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”",

    "description": "Canadians are staying away from their usual snowbird destinations, with many opting for domestic trips, or looking towards Mexico, and the Caribbean.",
    "fullText": "Canadian travellers are still unhappy with President Donald Trump, and that's affecting the 2026 outlook of visitors to the US from Canada.\n\nIn 2025, there was a noticeable travel chill from the US's northern neighbor, following President Donald Trump's quips about the \"51st state\" and the levying of hefty tariffs.\n\nA January survey of more than 1,000 Canadian prospective travelers found that they remain hesitant to travel to the US and would rather support domestic tourism, according to Longwoods International, a tourism industry market research company.\n\nAccording to Longwoods International, 55% of surveyed Canadian travelers report that they intend to travel to the US within the next 12 months, which remains mostly unchanged from 54% reported in October 2025. Among those who intend to make the trip, only 9% say they have already made bookings.\n\nIn 2025, 4 million fewer Canadian travelers visited the US than the previous year, marking a 22% drop, according to the US Commerce Department's National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Canadian respondents to the latest survey, who said they changed their 2026 travel plans to avoid the US, cited economic policies and tariffs.\n\nOther factors are also at work. More than 40% of respondents told Longwoods International that they strongly or somewhat disagree that the US is a place that values international travelers, welcomes travelers with diverse backgrounds, is a safe place to visit, and feels welcoming in general, and the number of Canadians who agree that the US feels safe to visit has been declining over the past year.\n\nPopular destinations for Canadian snowbirds, such as southern California and Florida, have been trying to woo them back. But it appears that those attempts have fallen flat as Trump continues to threaten Canada with tariffs and recently threatened to delay the opening of a bridge Canada paid for.\n\nIn 2025, California's Gov. Gavin Newsom began trying to convince Canadians with targeted video campaigns that California welcomes them. Recently, heart-shaped banners featuring the Canadian flag also popped up in Palm Springs, which, according to the Los Angeles Times, is feeling a chill this winter from fewer Canadian tourists.\n\n\"Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in DC, but don't let that ruin your beach plans,\" Newsom said in a campaign video. \"California is the ultimate playground — over 2,000 miles from Washington and a world away in mindset.\"\n\nAccording to Visit California, the number of Canadian visitors to the state still fell by over 18% in 2025 compared to the year prior, slipping to 1.4 million. In 2024, Visit California showed that 1.7 million Canadians visited the state and spent around $3.7 billion.\n\nEven Disney, the happiest place on earth, is feeling the impact as international travelers skip the US. In the Walt Disney Company's first-quarter earnings report earlier in February, the company said it is facing \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks, including Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.\n\nVisit Florida lists Canada as the state's top source of international visitors, with around 3.4 million travelers from Canada to the state in 2024. In 2025, the state saw a 15% year-over-year drop, according to Visit Florida, with only 2.9 million visitors from Canada.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet are also suspending all or some flights from Canada to the US this summer.\n\n\"We saw a notable decline in transborder travel demand throughout 2025,\" Julia Kaiser, media relations advisor for WestJet, told Global News earlier in February. \"As a result, we made timely decisions to modify our network to stay aligned with where Canadians want to go.\"\n\nThe slowdown in trips to the US doesn't mean that Canadians are no longer traveling. Longwoods International said that 45% of Canadian travelers who changed their plans for a US trip now say they would substitute it with a domestic trip, while about a quarter of prospective travelers are looking toward Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nAs of February 17, China also opened up visa-free entry for all Canadian citizens, allowing up to 30 days of travel for business, tourism, family visits, or transit.",

    "fullText": "CNN’s studio mic caught an anchor’s unvarnished reaction to an aside from President Donald Trump that involved his lack of affection for “handsome men.”\n\nTrump gave a speech Thursday morning at an event promoting his Board of Peace at the contentiously renamed “Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.”\n\nAccording to pool reports, there were pro-Palestinian protesters across the street from the building “with big signs yelling ‘Donald Trump go to hell.’”\n\nThe president’s speech featured the usual stylistic flourishes and characteristic deviations — including one aside that caught CNN anchor Sara Sidner off guard.\n\nSidner and co-anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan covered the speech live on Thursday’s edition of CNN News Central, during which the network cut in midway through Trump’s remarks.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He’s a great guy. They’re all great. But I was very proud of it.\n\nPresident Penna (Peña) of Paraguay is here. President. President, thank you very much.\n\nYoung, handsome guy. It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you.\n\nI don’t like young, handsome men.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Women, I like. Men, I don’t have any interest.\n\nCNN ANCHOR JOHN BERMAN: Right. President Trump is speaking to his Board of Peace. This is the organization he founded first to help rebuild Gaza.\n\nTrump riffed freely as he introduced the other leaders at the event, as well.\n\nElsewhere in the speech, Trump appeared to try and assuage concerns about his entity being at odds with the United Nations, claiming his goal was to “strengthen up” the UN:\n\nThe Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly. But we’re going to strengthen up the United Nations. We’re going to make sure it’s facilities are good if they need help, and they need help, money wise, we can help them money wise. And we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable.\n\nWatch above via CNN News Central.\n\nThe post Hot Mic Catches CNN Anchor’s Stunned Reaction to Trump Blurting He Doesn’t ‘Like Handsome Men’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Trump's plan to 'deprioritize' student-loan oversight has lawmakers worried about how your servicer is performing",
    "description": "After the major student-loan companies declined to release their own performance data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren requested information from the Ed. Dept.",
    "fullText": "Curious how your student-loan servicer is performing? You might be out of luck — for now.\n\nWhen asked by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for data on their performances, the major student-loan servicers delivered nearly identical responses — exclusively reviewed by Business Insider — that referred the lawmaker back to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office.\n\nOne servicer, MOHELA, wrote in a January 5 email to Warren that it has \"a formal statement that FSA has requested we send.\"\n\nThe statement, which the other servicers also sent, stated: \"Because your letter requests information and data maintained by the Department's office of Federal Student Aid, we respectfully ask that the request be redirected to the Department via the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\"\n\nMonitoring student-loan servicers' performance will become more critical this year as the Department of Education begins implementing its repayment changes that President Donald Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It will also prove more difficult after the Trump administration slashed staff at the consumer watchdog that played a large role in doing so.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers have expressed confusion about the changes, and lawmakers and policy experts have previously stressed the importance of ensuring that servicers are equipped to effectively implement new repayment plans, borrowing caps, and other reforms.\n\nIn response to a prior information request from Warren, Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent wrote in a letter in September 2025 that \"FSA is prioritizing efforts to improve customer service to student and parent borrowers,\" and did not comment on formally releasing performance metrics.\n\nThe last comprehensive report on servicer performance and borrower data posted on FSA's website covered the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Past reports have included customer satisfaction scores, average speed to answer calls, and data on the servicers' portfolios. Warren and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that, following the servicers' responses, they are requesting that the Department of Education publish servicer performance data and make it available to the public.\n\n\"ED has repeatedly refused to comply with Congressional requests for basic servicer performance data and now appears to be refusing to allow federal student loan servicers to provide this information, despite previous Administrations granting such requests,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWarren and Merkley requested that the Department of Education provide data on a range of topics, including call center performance, customer service staff levels, and communication efforts to borrowers in delinquency and default.\n\nOversight over the industry has declined due to the Trump administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that Warren helped create. The CFPB's chief legal officer directed the agency's employees in an April 2025 memo to \"deprioritize\" student-loan oversight, saying that the goal was to shift oversight responsibility to the states.\n\nAdditionally, Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues released a new report in early February detailing how private lenders are preparing for an influx of federal borrowers due to the new borrowing caps set to go into effect this summer. They wrote that their findings \"underscore an urgent need for oversight of the private lending market as these companies prepare to cash in on the Administration's agenda.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is trying to chip away at the integrity of the voting process ahead of the November midterms because he knows Republicans will not fare well, Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf says.\n\nRothkopf told The Daily Beast Podcast that the Trump administration’s actions and the president’s words should be taken “very seriously.”\n\n“The reality is that they realize they’re going to lose, and so they are using every conceivable tool in order to put their thumb on the scale, right?” Rothkopf told host Joanna Coles.\n\nRothkopf gave two examples: the FBI’s controversial raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election office for 2020 voter rolls and other materials, and Attorney General Pam Bondi offering to scale back Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis only if Governor Tim Walz provided voters’ unredacted personal data.\n\n“Why do they want the voter rolls? So they can disqualify people. Why do they want to pursue the conspiracy theories about Fulton County? So they can say, ‘Well, we need to impound these machines. There’s a potential problem’,” he said. “You will never see the votes again. You will never see what comes out of that.”\n\nRothkopf also cited the GOP-favoring redistricting effort that Texas began, and which other red-leaning states like Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina followed. He also mentioned the SAVE America Act. That legislation, which has passed the House, would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote and government-issued photo ID to vote in federal elections. It would also limit mail-in voting and end ballot harvesting. Critics have argued that eligible voters without passports or birth certificates would be disenfranchised.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s Department of Justice has been seeking unredacted copies of voter registration databases, with critics arguing this is a federal intrusion into state matters.\n\nComments by Trump are also cause for alarm. The president has not only called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” but has also floated canceling the midterms.\n\nMAGA stalwart Steve Bannon has said Trump is bent on proving that the 2020 election was stolen from him in order to then prevent Democratic wins in 2026 and 2028.\n\nIf any of Trump’s actions targeting the 2026 midterms end up being prosecutable, and if Republicans can “put their thumb on the scale” again in 2028, Rothkopf said, Trump will support a successor who will “cover his a--.” In that case, the ticket would be Bondi and Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nBondi “has completely debased herself—taken the entire Department of Justice, turned it into a Department of Obstruction of Justice and Retribution,” Rothkopf said. “And in [Trump’s] book, that’s a winner.”\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson repeated the administration’s line that “anything said on the Daily Beast podcast is equivalent to screaming into the void. No one listens to this Trump Derangement Syndrome therapy session.”\n\nTrump “is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” Jackson added. “The President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

    "description": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was stunned when CBS reporter Ed O'Keefe asked for examples of President Trump being \"falsely called racist\"",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was visibly stunned after CBS’s Ed O’Keefe asked for examples of President Donald Trump being “falsely called racist” in recent years.\n\n“You’re kidding, right?” replied Leavitt during a White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nShe was responding to O’Keefe’s question, which quoted Trump’s tribute to Jesse Jackson a day earlier.\n\nIn his statement about Jesse Jackson, the president said “Despite the fact that I am falsely inconsistently called a racist by the scoundrels and lunatics on the radical left, Democrats all, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” Where or when does the president believe he has been falsely called racist?\n\nThat spurred Leavitt’s shocked response and led to a few audible chuckles in the briefing room.\n\n“I will pull you plethora of examples. I’m going to get my team in that room to start going through the internet of radical Democrats throughout the years who have accused this president falsely of being a racist,” Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued, “And I’m sure there’s many people in this room and on network television across the country who have accused him of the same. In fact, I know that because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”\n\nLeavitt added that Trump was looking forward to a Black History Month event scheduled for later in the day.\n\n“There is a lot this president has done for all Americans, regardless of race,” she said. “And he has absolutely been falsely called and smeared as a racist, and I’m happy to provide you those receipts.”\n\nTrump’s racial attitudes have long been called out by high-profile media personalities. Ex-CNN star Don Lemon branded Trump a “racist” in 2018, and called him a “racist piece of sh*t” last year. Another CNN alum, Jim Acosta, said in 2018 “this president deep down may just be a racist.” MS NOW anchor Lawrence O’Donnell dubbed Trump the “most racist” president who never owned slaves in 2024, and his colleague, Chris Hayes, called Trump “to his bones a racist” after he posted a video depicting ex-President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes earlier this month.\n\nOther examples include NBC White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accusing Trump of using a “racist term” when he called COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” CBS reporter Weijia Jiang similarly said Trump used “racist phrases” during the pandemic, and Geraldo Rivera — a former longtime friend of the president’s — referring to Trump’s crackdown on migrants as “racist government policy.”\n\nAnd soon after the press briefing wrapped up, one of the White House’s X accounts posted an example of O’Keefe himself calling out Trump for “racist tweets” in 2019:\n\nThis reporter literally called President Trump's tweets racist in 2019. https://t.co/HlgnNg9DZA pic.twitter.com/Crjf26Qttj\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) February 18, 2026\n\nThe post ‘You’re Kidding, Right?’ Karoline Leavitt Gobsmacked After Reporter Asks for Examples of Trump Being ‘Falsely Called Racist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",

    "description": "The admission comes after former President Barack Obama went viral for claiming aliens are real",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, says the president has a speech pre-written and is ready to address the discovery of aliens.\n\nLara, 43, made the shocking claim in an episode of the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast, published Wednesday, after she was asked about former President Barack Obama's apparent confirmation that aliens are real during an interview last weekend.\n\n“I believe I’ve heard on your podcast that you’ve discussed with the president these UFOs. Do you think that he’s about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” host Miranda Devine asked.\n\n“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...”Lara began.\n\nHowever, the president reportedly “played a little coy” when she and her husband, his son, Eric Trump, inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n“Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won’t even fully tell us, maybe there’s more to it,’” she said.\n\n“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.\n\nHer comments come as Obama made a stunning admission over the weekend during an appearance on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast.\n\nWhen asked about extraterrestrials, Obama replied, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in — what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Internet went wild over his admission that aliens are real, prompting the former commander-in-chief to take to Instagram to clarify his stance.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” the former president wrote. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us,” he continued,\n\nDoubling down on his claim, he added, “Really!”\n\nIts long been speculated by many that aliens and UFOs are hidden at the mysterious Area 51 base in southern Nevada — and a documentary released last year suggested that Trump may soon confirm the existence of other life forms.\n\nIn The Age of Disclosure, director Dan Farah suggests that a massive government cover-up operation has concealed the existence of non-human intelligence, but that the cover-up will soon be exposed.\n\n“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,’” Farah told Entertainment Weekly in late November.\n\n“It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.”\n\nDespite Farah’s claims, Trump has not yet shared a definitive answer about the existence of aliens since returning to office.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - California, Colorado and Washington are suing the federal government to force ‌it to pay out grants approved by Congress for ‌clean energy projects, the California attorney general's office said on Wednesday.\n\nThe ​Trump administration terminated some funding allocated under environmentally focused laws, including the Inflation Reduction Act, reflecting a broad effort to check support for wind, solar and other fossil-free power ‌sources while prioritizing ⁠increased U.S. oil production. States, including California, have been among the main foils to various ⁠Trump administration policies, launching dozens of suits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday told Reuters about plans to ​sue over ​changes in vaccine policy and ​a plan to challenge ‌the rescission of a key Environmental Protection Agency finding, known as the endangerment finding, that was key to climate change regulation, for instance.\n\nThe new suit responds in part to California's loss of $1.2 billion in federal funding for ‌the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen ​Energy Systems, or ARCHES, Bonta ​said. The hydrogen plan ​was intended to replace fossil fuels in ‌utilities, public transit, trucking and ​ports.\n\nFederal agencies must ​execute laws, California said. \"It's as simple as Congress has the power of the purse, not the executive ​branch, and Congress ‌already appropriated this funding,\" Bonta said in an ​interview on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement.",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is having an ‘I told you so’ moment when it comes to President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAt November’s blockbuster arguments, Gorsuch raised alarm about what he called a “one-way ratchet” of authority from Congress to the president if Trump wins a case that challenges his use of emergency powers to impose duties on a host of countries.\n\n“It’s going to be veto-proof,” Gorsuch warned of Trump’s declared emergencies.\n\n“What president’s ever going to give that power back? A pretty rare president. So how should that inform our view?”\n\nGorsuch’s concern is now in the limelight as the justices prepare to return to the bench to issue opinions on three separate days between now and next Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Trump saw one of the first major pushbacks from Congress on the matter, when six House Republicans joined Democrats in voting 219-211 to repeal Trump’s Canada tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That measure now heads to the Senate, where four Republicans joined Democrats last year on a similar effort. The new vote only needs a simple majority.\n\nBut even if it gets to Trump’s desk, the revolt is largely symbolic. The bipartisan support for repealing the tariffs falls far short of the two-thirds majority needed in both the House and Senate to override an expected veto.\n\nGorsuch saw it coming — and he wasn’t the only Trump-nominated justice to read the tea leaves back at November’s arguments.\n\n“Let’s say that we adopt your interpretation of the statute,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett told the government. “If Congress said, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that, that gives a president too much authority under IEEPA,’ it’s going to have a very hard time pulling the tariff power out of IEEPA, correct?”\n\nCongress can amend IEEPA at any time to make clear whether the 1977 law does, or does not, authorize Trump’s tariffs. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has expressed no appetite for doing so, leaving the nine justices to parse the nearly half-century-old phrasing that has left global financial markets in suspense for months.\n\n“I think the sentiment is that we allow a little bit more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch,” Johnson said last week.\n\nNo one outside the court knows if the tariffs’ opinion is being sent to the printers right now, or if there’s still time for tweaks. When it is released, watch to see if any of the justices take note of the recent developments on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to convince the justices that Congress can, indeed, claw back power from the president. Solicitor General D. John Sauer would like everyone to remember that Congress clubbed together the votes to terminate the massive COVID-19 emergency just a few years ago.\n\n“What the statute reflects is there’s going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency. Nevertheless, that’s a political discipline,” Sauer said during the tariff arguments.\n\nSpeculation is still running rampant about exactly when the Supreme Court will release the highly anticipated decision. Some 105 days have now passed since oral arguments, longer than other recent expedited cases.\n\nWhen asked about the wait during her book promo on “CBS Mornings” last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t think much of it.  There are “lots of nuanced legal issues” and “it takes a while to write,” she said.\n\n“The court is going through its process of deliberation, and the American people expect for us to be thorough and clear in our determinations, and sometimes that takes time,” Jackson said.\n\nThe fact the junior liberal justice said anything at all was notable, as Supreme Court justices typically steer clear of talking about pending cases. Full stop.\n\nWe’ve got our ears perked up. As the justices return to the bench, the court has signaled it will hand down opinions Friday, Tuesday and next Wednesday.\n\nBettors on prediction markets think it could be coming. After the court scheduled the opinion days, the odds of the tariff decision landing this month jumped from 40 percent to more than 70 percent on Kalshi, a popular prediction market.\n\nSandwiched between two of the opinion day releases is the State of the Union, scheduled for Tuesday evening.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and several of the other justices typically attend; here’s the list of who has shown up each year. It’s a rare face-to-face moment between the justices and the president, with every move scrutinized.\n\nAs Roberts and the others sat in last year for Trump’s address, they were also sitting on the president’s emergency appeal seeking to freeze foreign aid. The justices released the decision — against Trump — at 8:59 a.m. the next morning.\n\nWelcome to The Gavel, The Hill’s weekly courts newsletter from Ella Lee and Zach Schonfeld. Reach out to us on X (@ByEllaLee, @ZachASchonfeld) or Signal (elee.03, zachschonfeld.48). \n\nJudges get new leeway to defend the courts\n\nFederal judges have been granted new wiggle room to speak out about the importance of the judiciary as threats and attacks on the courts surge.\n\nAn advisory opinion from the Judicial Conference’s Committee on Codes of Conduct affirmed that the ethics code abided by judges allows them to advocate for the rule of law and defend the independence of the courts, including to seek increased judicial security and funding.\n\nThe opinion goes further to say that, in some circumstances, judges may stand up for their peers against unjust attacks.\n\n“Although this Commentary addresses persecution specifically, the Committee believes the Code and its previous advisory opinions leave room, in at least some circumstances, for the measured defense of judicial colleagues from illegitimate forms of criticism and attacks that risk undermining judicial independence or the rule of law, whether or not they rise to the level of persecution,” the opinion reads.\n\nIt makes no reference to any specific assault on the judiciary. But it follows years of tongue-lashing and impeachment threats from Trump and his allies, especially toward judges who rule against the president. At the same time, public trust in the courts has fallen to near-record lows.\n\nIt points to Roberts’s 2024 year-end report as a guidepost, which addressed four detriments to judicial independence: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments. Roberts has pushed back on Trump’s threats, though he’s also at turns spoken out about Democrats’ rhetoric.\n\nJudges should avoid acting in a manner that detracts from their official duties and impartiality of the court, commenting on the merits of active matters or engaging in certain political activities, the opinion says.\n\nThey also must watch their tone in writing outside the courtroom, avoiding “sensationalism,” and consider where they choose to speak, so as not to create questions about their fairness.\n\n“These general cautions in the Code do not lend themselves well to precise definitions,” the opinion notes, “and even seemingly clear limits permit a variety of exceptions.”\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, called the opinion a “a strong step forward for ethics and for judicial independence,” suggesting it showed the committee pushing back on Trump.\n\n“Though individuals are not called out by name, this is a strong rebuke of the Trump administration’s ‘war’ on the judiciary and comes one day after Attorney General [Pam] Bondi denounced ‘liberal activist judges’ for taking part in ‘coordinated […] unlawful attack’ against President Trump’s ‘authority,’” he said in a statement Thursday. “Any judge who, in a measured manner, seeks to counter that nonsense would thus be ethically sound.”\n\nAs attacks on the judiciary have escalated, some judges have spoken out anonymously in the press, or in rarer instances, publicly. It’s especially prevalent as threats against judges continue to rise.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, there were 564 threats against judges, according to U.S. Marshals Service data. Since fiscal 2026 began in October, there have already been 176 threats.\n\nWhat to know about the Supreme Court’s new recusal software\n\nMore ethics news landed Tuesday, this time from the Supreme Court.\n\nStarting in March, the justices will use new software to help identify when they should recuse from a case.\n\nIt’s the justices’ latest effort to align themselves with lower federal judges, who have been required to use an automated conflict-screening system for the past two decades.\n\nThe Supreme Court is not bound by lower judges’ code of conduct.\n\nIt has left the justices playing catch up as public scrutiny into their ethics sharpens, spurred by investigations into the justices’ book deals and luxury trips paid for by billionaires.\n\nTwo years ago, the justices responded to mounting pressure by agreeing to a statement of ethical principles.\n\nCritics emphasize it has no enforcement mechanism. It did, however, direct that the court consider adding a new screening software.\n\nTo be clear, the justices have long identified conflicts. Last term, the justices recused more than 80 times in total, according to The Gavel’s docket tracker. And since this term began in October, the recusal count has already surpassed 30.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito is by far the leader, a reflection of his decision to own direct stock holdings in more than two dozen companies. Alito this term has recused more than twice as many times as any of his colleagues.\n\nStill, catching all necessary recusals is a tall task. The court received nearly 4,000 petitions to take up cases last term, many of which involve a complicated web of companies.\n\nJust last month, Alito recused from a battle between Louisiana parishes and major oil companies at the eleventh hour before the arguments. Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips, which owns a company named in the suit, but that company had insisted it was no longer involved in the case. It turned out not to be true.\n\nAnd in 2024, Gorsuch belatedly stepped aside from another environmental case after pressure from Democrats over his ties to a billionaire that had filed a brief.\n\nRoth, Fix The Court’s executive director, said the more effective change would’ve been for Alito to divest all direct stock holdings. Every other justice does so except for Roberts.\n\n“So although the new rule is a net positive since it comes in service of the full Court’s adoption of conflict-check software, it’s not a major improvement, and it should not have taken 827 days post-Code to implement,” Roth said in a statement.\n\n“That’s especially true since lower court judges have been required to use software-based conflict screening for 20 years, and several justices have been rumored to continue to use it after they were elevated,” he continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not publicly demoed its new software. If you’ve seen it, drop us a line.\n\nWhen it launches, litigants must send a list of the stock tickers for companies involved in their case so it can be run through the screening.\n\nKelly’s court win: A federal judge blocked the Pentagon’s efforts to censure Sen. Mark Kelly and lower his retirement rank in the wake of a video in which the senator and other fellow Democrats called on service members to reject unlawful orders.\n\nNY redistricting reaches SCOTUS: Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) urged the Supreme Court to stop her state judiciary from ordering a redraw of her congressional district ahead of the midterms, casting it as unconstitutional.\n\nMN evidence fight: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it was formally notified by the FBI that the bureau will not share any information about its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.\n\nGateway Tunnel fight: A federal appeals court allowed a judge’s order requiring the Trump administration to resume funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey to take effect.\n\nBenghazi attack prosecution: A man facing federal charges in connection with the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans pleaded not guilty.\n\nSwift resolution: Taylor Swift filed legal action to block a bedding company from getting a trademark on a logo that says, “Swift Home.” The company soon after withdrew its application. Read the BBC’s report on the dustup.\n\n‘Straight to the source’: As the Supreme Court mulls its tariff decision, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) visited the National Archives to lay eyes on the constitutional ink that gives Congress the power to collect taxes and duties. “Went straight to the source. The Constitution is clear,” Bacon wrote on social media. The archives staff has a strict prohibition on taking photos of the Constitution, so add that to the list of special privileges you get as a member of Congress.\n\nMr. Wonderful wins defamation suit: A federal judge awarded “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary $2.83 million in his defamation lawsuit against Ben Armstrong, a famous cryptocurrency influencer known as “BitBoy Crypto.” Armstrong called O’Leary a murderer over a 2019 fatal accident involving his boat, which his wife was driving. She was later cleared of wrongdoing. The judge entered default judgment after Armstrong failed to meet court deadlines.\n\nPetitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.\n\nHere’s a look at four major legal battles that reach the Supreme Court this week. At their closed-door conference Friday, the justices will consider taking them up for next term.\n\nNot all the cases are likely to be granted, but they each are legal battles that have played prominently for years:\n\nTrump’s E. Jean Carroll verdict: President Trump seeks review of the jury’s verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s, which Trump denies, and ordered him to pay $5 million. The president says the jury shouldn’t have heard the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape or testimony from other women who have accused Trump of misconduct. He also argues he should’ve been allowed to tell jurors that a Democratic mega-donor was paying Carroll’s legal bills. The case is Trump v. Carroll.\n\nMore guns: For weeks, the court has stalled announcing whether it will hear Second Amendment challenges against AR-15 and high-capacity magazine bans as well as the federal felon-in-possession law. The pileup grows this week. In Fooks v. Maryland and Mancuso v. New York, the court is asked to hear challenges to state felon-in-possession laws. And in National Association for Gun Rights v. Lamont and Grant v. Higgins, it is also being petitioned to hear a challenge to Connecticut’s AR-15 ban.\n\nNRA’s free speech fight: The National Rifle Association (NRA) is at the high court, but not on the Second Amendment. It’s about the First Amendment. In 2024, the justices unanimously ruled the gun rights group can proceed in its free speech fight against a New York regulator. When the case returned to a lower court, it again sided with the regulator. So, the NRA is back. The case is NRA v. Vullo.\n\nFor-profit college settlement: Everglades College wants the Supreme Court to revive its fight against a class action settlement the Biden administration approved, which cancels $7.5 billion in student debt for those who alleged fraud by for-profit colleges. Lower courts ruled the college had no legal standing, meaning no right to sue over the settlement. The case is Everglades College v. McMahon.\n\nDon’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:\n\nMark Zuckerberg is expected to testify in a landmark social media addiction trial in Los Angeles.\n\nNew York’s elections board is due to respond in writing to Rep. Nicole Malliotakis’s (R-N.Y.) Supreme Court emergency application seeking to revive her congressional district.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nA federal magistrate judge in Virginia will hold a hearing to weigh Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson’s bid for the return of her devices that were seized in an FBI search of her home.\n\nA federal judge in Minnesota is set to hold a status conference in the criminal case of Vance Boelter, the man accused of shooting two state lawmakers and their spouses, killing one of the couples.\n\nThe Supreme Court will announce orders.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments in two cases involving Cuba, over whether the Helms-Burton Act enables Havana Docks to seek compensation from major cruise lines that docked at Havana’s port and whether lawsuits filed under the statute also clear the normal immunity rules for hauling a foreign government into court.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to announce opinions.\n\nThe justices will also hear oral arguments over whether judges have authority to excuse the 30-day time limit for defendants to remove a state lawsuit to federal court in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is set to hear oral arguments over the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit is also set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of an order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from clawing back billions of dollars in climate spending.\n\nRachel Weiner in Court Watch: The Rabbit Hole: Covering the Courts from a Windowless Office\n\nThe Washington Post’s Peter Whoriskey: Killers without a cause: The rise in nihilistic violent extremism\n\nGreen Matters’s Shreya Patnaik: The Colorado River Now Holds Legal Personhood.

    "description": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve that asserts US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve asserting that US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion, which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan, based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"\n\nWhat percentage of tariff costs did US consumers bear?\n\nHow did the Trump administration respond to the study?\n\nWhat did the NY Fed study find about tariff costs?\n\nHow did tariff pass-through rates change throughout 2025?\n\nAuthors Mary Amiti, head of labor and product markets at the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, along with research analyst Chris Flanagan and research economist Sebastian Heise, analyzed the tariffs instituted last year and found that 94% were borne by the US in the first eight months of 2025. Just 6% of those costs were absorbed by foreign exporters.\n\nThe analysis covered 12-month changes from January 2024 through November 2025 (the most recent available data). The analysis also noted how the pass-through of costs changed over the course of 2025. For instance, by November, the pass-through of costs borne in the US had declined to 86%.\n\nThe authors said their results show that a 10% tariff led to only a 0.6 percentage-point decline in foreign export prices. But they also found that the tariff pass-through into import prices declined later last year, as more exporters bore the costs of tariffs. In November, a 10% tariff was associated with a 1.4% decline in foreign export prices, though still an 86% pass-through to US import prices.\n\nThe authors said the higher import prices caused firms to reorganize their supply chains.\n\n\"In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHassett maintains that tariffs affect a multitude of price factors, including supply and demand, which shift around consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n\"They’re basically only looking at changes in prices,\" Hassett said.\n\nHe pointed to other metrics, such as lower inflation and higher wages, which suggest consumers are better off.\n\n\"Incomes are up way more than the cost of living, and that's the real wage gain that this silly Fed study neglects to mention,\" Hassett said.",

    "fullText": "Inflation may be cooling, but there's one part of Americans' routines that isn't yet feeling relief: a morning cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee was among the commodities hit by Donald Trump's tariff policies last year, with prices continuing to rise in 2026. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average price of coffee across the US reached $9.37 per pound in January, a 33% increase since last year.\n\nThe 33% increase has pushed coffee bean prices to their highest level since the 1980s, when data on the commodity were first collected. Yet, while costs in the US have surged, they've actually fallen on a global scale, dropping to $3.64 per pound in January.\n\nTariffs on imports from Brazil are part of the reason they're still high in the US, but they don't fully explain the disconnect.\n\nGlobally, the combination of a positive supply outlook for the coming year, as previous production shortfalls start to ease, is keeping a lid on international coffee prices.\n\nMeanwhile, a split between the US and the rest of the world has been taking shape for a while.\n\nCoffee shops began raising prices following Trump's sweeping Liberation Day tariffs. This included levying a 46% tariff against Vietnam and 10% tariffs against Brazil and Colombia, the three nations that account for more than 60% of the US's coffee supply.\n\nIn July, Trump moved to impose a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports of food and beverages, a policy that was set to spike the cost of coffee. He ultimately walked the decision back in November, but the impact is still being felt in coffee markets.\n\nImporters typically lock in prices months in advance. As such, Trump's rollback of tariffs on major coffee producers likely hasn't yet shown up in prices.\n\nWhile it's true that the post-tariff discount could be felt in the coming months, it doesn't mean prices will come down, especially as consumers seem willing to pay higher prices at the moment. Leading coffee stocks such as Starbucks and Keurig Dr. Pepper have performed well in 2026, rising 14% and 5% year to date, respectively.",

    "fullText": "For eight years, President Barack Obama's aides marveled that no amount of mockery, dismissal or scandal could make Donald Trump go away.\n\nTheir bewilderment is threaded through hundreds of interviews with administration officials released Tuesday in a far-reaching oral history of the Obama presidency. Throughout, Obama's advisers — some of the nation’s most accomplished political and policy experts — described their ongoing education about an electorate increasingly influenced by whatever the nascent social media told them.\n\nOver two terms in the White House, they got glimpses of a future in which conspiracy theories, such as the lie that Obama was born outside the United States, survived online. What they missed, right up to Election Night 2016, was Trump's political resilience and his understanding that alienated Americans could vote for a man the White House considered a “clown.”\n\n“He's done,” David Simas, Obama's White House political director, recalls telling the president. It was October 2016, five weeks before Election Day, and Simas had just handed his phone to Obama to watch the explosive news of Trump's “Access Hollywood” recording. Fast-forward to hours before voters went to the polls. Simas recognized Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead had shrunk to perhaps three points. “She’s fine,” he recalls thinking. “That’s the night before.”\n\nTrump defeated Clinton in the Electoral College by 306 to Clinton's 232 but lost the popular vote, an outcome long known to have stunned and devastated Democrats. But the interviews filled in the degree to which aides, pollsters and news outlets disregarded the prospect of a Trump victory even as Americans increasingly distrusted government and established political figures.\n\n“Not many people even expected that he had a chance to win,” said former White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “It was hard not to take it personally, because Trump’s candidacy, the essence of his being, and everything that he stood for, and everything about the way that he carried himself, and everything that he championed, and his rhetoric, his campaign tactics— all were anathema to everything that the Obama campaign and the Obama era, the Obama administration, had been about.”\n\nAcross the Obama Presidency Oral History project's interviews with 450 people, his advisers said that Trump rebuked what they saw as the administration's accomplishments: An emergency rescue of the economy, a bailout of the auto industry, a form of national health insurance and landmark climate change regulation. All along, many described climbing a learning curve on how young and old Americans get their news, red and blue “team” politics — and how to leverage social media, something Trump seemed to innately understand.\n\nAn extraordinary stretch that began in April 2011 illustrated the denial, the dismissal and what's thought to have been a moment that helped cement Trump's decision to run for president.\n\nThe New York mogul had been fueling the false conspiracy theory that Obama, who was born in Hawaii, had not been born in the United States. That suggested he was not qualified to be president, a question that touched on Obama's race. It bothered him personally, advisers said, and initially Obama agreed with many advisers to ignore it.\n\n“He felt with all the important things that needed to be dealt with, this was stupid and shouldn’t be dignified. But ultimately, it had to be,” recalled David Axelrod, then Obama's senior adviser.\n\nObama released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, showing he'd been born in Hawaii.\n\n“I thought it was a mistake at the time, because I thought, 'This is absurd, and it’s unnecessary and beneath him to dignify the question,” Nancy-Ann DeParle, a former White House deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nWhat it meant for speechwriter Jon Favreau was that Obama's jokes for the White House Correspondents Dinner just a few days later had to be changed. They knew Trump would be at the dinner and the issues at hand, Favreau said in his interview, were serious. “I thought what he was doing was racist,” Favreau said. “I thought that it was not just damaging to Obama but damaging to the country.”\n\nSeriousness aside, he described a marathon of joke-writing with Hollywood director and writer Judd Apatow on the phone that left Favreau and others in hysterics. The prospect of Trump becoming president? “Not even a brief moment did I ever think that,” he said.\n\nAs for the speech, Obama “loved it,” Favreau said. Obama's sense of humor, he noted, can lean sarcastic.\n\nObama opened with a cheery, “Mahalo!” and played a mock birth video in a dig at Fox News.\n\n“I want to make clear to the Fox News table: That was a joke,” he said. “That was not my real birth video. That was a children’s cartoon.”\n\nThen he noted that “Donald Trump is here tonight!” Trump glowered from his table.\n\n\"We all know about your credentials and breadth of experience,” Obama continued, as the Washington glitterati snickered. Just recently on Trump's show, the president said, “At the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around.” Whom to fire in such a situation, Obama said sarcastically, was among “the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.”\n\nThe next day, Obama announced the killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden during a U.S. commando raid in Pakistan. He'd authorized the strike earlier in the week without the knowledge of most close aides, and so knew about it as he relished his takedown of Trump.\n\n“In some ways, it was cathartic for the president,” Axelrod said of the speech.\n\nEarlier in the evening, he recalled, he walked by Trump's table and overheard him saying he's toying with running for president. Axelrod “chuckled at it and went to my seat.”\n\n“Obviously, we misread that,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) on Tuesday questioned why President Trump and other GOP lawmakers haven’t locked down the Texas Senate race with an endorsement in the three-way party primary. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) are vying for Cornyn’s seat in the Senate. The frequently nasty battle between Paxton and Cornyn has left some Democrats thinking it could create an opening for their party in November, particularly if Paxton wins.\n\nFetterman said he thinks his party can regain the House but argued the battle to retake the Senate majority will be an uphill one during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\nHe also argued that Trump and the GOP are putting Texas in play by not backing Cornyn.\n\n“I mean, as you point out, the margin is very close. And there’s always — history always tells us there’s a backlash against the party in power. … So I think most people would have assumed that the House is going to flip. Now, here in the Senate, that’s a little more difficult, and now you have other races in play,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.\n\n“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don’t know why politically — I’m not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn’t sit on that and just lock down Texas. But for me, there’s other states that are in flux,” he added.\n\nDemocrats are having their own contentious primary in Texas between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico.\n\nFetterman has shared a dismal outlook on his party. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania senator said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) is “part of the rot in the Democratic Party” for her foreign policy stance denouncing Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n“For me, stand with Israel. I’ll never vote for any kinds of restrictions on aid, whether it’s military, financial, or intelligence. There are never to be any restrictions on that. And now, for here we are, we can have peace. Again, that’s become part of the serious problem in our party,” Fetterman told Bartiromo.\n\nHe later added, “I refuse to pander to the part of my Democratic Party that finds that there’s value in being anti-Israel. And that’s effectively — they use the word ‘anti-Zionism’ — I mean, effectively what that’s really become on college campuses and places is just antisemitism. We have a problem here in our party, and I’m going to stand against that and always be an unapologetic supporter for Israel.”",

    "description": "Amid this year's Presidents' Day celebrations, survey respondents tell Yahoo and YouGov that Trump is doing a worse job than Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
    "fullText": "As Americans return to work and school after the long Presidents’ Day weekend, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll has found that 40% of them now consider Donald Trump to be the “worst president in U.S. history.”\n\nAnother 12% think Trump is “worse than average” — meaning that overall, a majority of Americans (about 53%) now rate Trump as one of the least successful presidents ever to hold the office.\n\nOnly a third of Americans say Trump is either the best president in U.S. history (12%) or better than average (21%). An additional 9% believe Trump “ranks somewhere in the middle.”\n\nThe survey of 1,704 U.S. adults was conducted just before Presidents’ Day, which roughly coincides with George Washington’s birthday and honors the first U.S. president as well as all those who served after him.\n\nHistorians often use Presidents’ Day as an opportunity to rank commanders in chief; the last major tally was published in February 2024 by the Presidential Greatness Project. In it, 154 current and recent members of the American Political Science Association awarded Abraham Lincoln, the top finisher, an average zero-to-100 score of 93.87. Trump finished last, with an average score of 10.92.\n\nBut that was before Trump’s comeback victory the following November — and before the sweeping changes of his first year back in office. So now, two Februaries later, how are ordinary Americans judging Trump’s second term in relation to the presidencies that preceded it?\n\nNot very positively. Trump’s job approval rating (38%) is currently as low as it has ever been; his disapproval rating (58%) is higher than ever. That puts Trump a full 20 points “underwater.” In comparison, former President Joe Biden was about 8 points underwater at this stage of his presidency.\n\nIn particular, independents — who tend to decide elections — have soured on Trump. Before Trump took office again, more independents said they expected him to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%). But today, only 23% of independents say Trump is changing America for the better, while a clear majority (57%) say he is changing America for the worse.\n\nAll told, a majority of Americans now say for the first time that Trump is making America worse (52%) rather than better (34%) — and that his second term has turned out to be worse than they expected (51%) instead of better (25%).\n\nAmericans also think Trump is failing to meet the standard of performance set by his immediate Democratic predecessors.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump recently replaced a White House portrait of Biden with a photo of an autopen — and described Biden as “by far, the worst President in American History” on the plaque beneath the image — 49% of Americans think Trump is “doing a worse job than Biden.” Significantly fewer (41%) think Trump is doing a better job than Biden.\n\nAmong independents, a majority (53%) now believe Trump is doing worse than Biden. Just 33% say Trump is doing better.\n\nTrump compares even less favorably to former President Barack Obama — “one of the most divisive political figures in American History,” according to his new White House plaque. A full 55% of Americans think Trump is doing a worse job than Obama. Only 37% think Trump is doing better. Among independents, those numbers are 57% and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe president also faces a widening gap in the intensity of opinion between Americans who think he’s doing a good job and Americans who think he’s doing a bad job. Forty-nine percent now “strongly” disapprove of Trump’s job performance; less than half as many (22%) strongly approve.\n\nThe gap between Americans who consider Trump the worst president in U.S. history and those who consider him the best is similar.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,704 U.S. adults interviewed online from Feb. 9 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3%.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president's name on airports but says it doesn't plan on charging a fee — at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home.\n\nApplications filed by the Trump Organization with the federal trademark office are seeking exclusive rights to use the president's name on airports and dozens of related things found there, from buses shuttling passengers to umbrellas and travel bags to flight suits. The filings come amid debate in Florida over a state bill to name the Palm Beach airport after Trump and a dispute over funding of a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that is tied up with proposals that both it and the Dulles International Airport in Virginia bear his name.\n\nThe Trump Organization said that the applications were triggered by the Florida bill and that it didn't seek any profit — only protection against “bad actors” given that the Trump name is the “most infringed trademark in the world.”\n\n“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the company said it in a statement, referring to what is now called the Palm Beach International Airport near Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nThe company didn't respond immediately when asked if it would charge royalties for the use of the name at other airports in the future, or on merchandise listed for protection in the filings.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he's ever seen.\n\n“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”\n\nThe applications filed by a family company unit called DTTM Operations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are for the use of three names — President Donald J. Trump International Airport, Donald J. Trump International Airport and DJT.\n\nThe family has been on a branding spree in the past year, putting its name on towers, golf resorts and residential developments in Dubai, India, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The company has also been selling Trump branded electric guitars, bibles and sneakers, ventures that also fall under the DTTM unit.\n\nIn response to criticism that he and his family are profiting off the presidency, Trump has said that his business is held in trust by his sons and that he has no day-to-day involvement in the company.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration suffered a stinging defeat on Presidents Day after a Bush-appointed judge ruled against it while citing the dystopian novel 1984.\n\nU.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled on Monday that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington be reinstated after the Trump administration ordered its removal last month.\n\nThe National Park Service removed the exhibit from Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia in response to an executive order from Trump that was aimed at “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The order instructed the Interior Department to ensure that the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks do not display anything that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and the National Park Service for comment.\n\nNews cameras and onlookers recorded staff removing the exhibit late last month, with one park employee reportedly telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, “I’m just following my orders.”\n\nThe exhibit was located at the President’s House site in Philadelphia, where George and Martha Washington lived along with nine people enslaved by the couple when the city was briefly the nation’s capital.\n\nRufe ruled that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the legality of the removal filed by Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker plays out.\n\nTrump’s executive order, issued on March 27, 2025, and titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” stated that, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”\n\n“This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”\n\nIn her ruling, Rufe referenced George Orwell’s 1984, writing, “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts.”\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to whitewash history at multiple historical sites around the country, including removing a pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City just last week and erasing references to transgender people on the National Park Service’s website for the monument.\n\nReferences to the dispossession and mistreatment of Native Americans were also removed from an exhibit at Grand Canyon National Park, and roadside displays addressing climate change, pollution and mining were also flagged for potential removal.\n\nSenior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association Kristen Brengel told the Washington Post that the White House’s efforts should “offend every American.”\n\n“We are capable of hearing about our tragedies and our victories, and this systematic erasure should concern everyone in our country.”\n\nMS NOW’s Rachel Maddow celebrated the ruling on the Monday night edition of her show, quoting extensively from the ruling—noting that Rufe was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush—and telling viewers, “Happy Presidents’ Day, Philadelphia. You are getting your history put back up by court order at the President’s House.”",

    "fullText": "George W. Bush has penned a Presidents Day essay that made some pointed observations about power, humility, and presidents who refuse to step down from office.\n\nThe essay was published Monday by More Perfect, a bipartisan alliance working to “protect and renew” American democracy in the lead-up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe piece, which pays homage to George Washington, is the inaugural entry in a new history project called “In Pursuit,” and while it does not name President Donald Trump, it does seem to shade him, The New York Times reported.\n\n“Our first president could have remained all-powerful, but twice he chose not to,” Bush wrote. “In doing so, he set a standard for all presidents to live up to.”\n\nThe first president’s decision to relinquish control of the U.S. Army after the American Revolution and to step down from the presidency after two terms “ensured America wouldn’t become a monarchy, or worse,” Bush added.\n\nHis words seemed heavy with subtext, considering the current occupant of the White House tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, and is now threatening to run for a third, illegal presidential term.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nElsewhere in Bush’s essay, the 43rd president also praised Washington’s other non-Trumpian traits, describing how the nation’s first president made a point of cultivating self-control, courteousness, modesty, and diplomacy.\n\n“Few qualities have inspired me more than Washington’s humility,” he wrote. “Washington modeled what it means to put the good of the nation over self-interest and selfish ambition… he carried himself with dignity and self-restraint, honoring the office [of the president] without allowing to become invested with near-mythical powers.”\n\nThe Times noted that despite participating in the “In Pursuit” series—which will also feature contributions from former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Republicans such as Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts—Bush is not giving interviews.\n\nHis essay speaks for itself, former National Archivist Colleen Shogan told the Times. Shogan was abruptly fired by Trump in February 2025 and is now overseeing “In Pursuit.”\n\nThe project’s goal is to make history “relevant” but not overly narrow, she told the Times.\n\n“We are taking the long view of things,” she said. “The lesson of presidential humility transcends time.”",

    "description": "\"This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn before departing the White House, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. \n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) signed on Monday to co-sponsor a Democrat-led bill to amend the U.S. Constitution to give Congress oversight of presidential pardons, a measure aimed at pushing back at President Donald Trump’s highly controversial use of the presidential pardon power.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-MD) last December and would allow for a minimum of 20 House members and five senators to call for congressional review of a pardon, which would lead to a 60-day deadline for Congress to nullify that pardon with a two-thirds majority vote – similar to a veto override.\n\nOlszewski announced his bill, the Pardon Integrity Act, in a floor speech listing off some of Trump’s most controversial pardons, including a blanket pardon for all January 6th rioters – including those who violently attacked police officers.\n\n“None of us should accept it as normal practice that a president, any president, used their executive pardon power to absolve convicted drug kingpins, those found guilty of violently attacking law enforcement officers, and even a money laundering crypto magnate with ties to the president’s family business,” Olszewski said in his speech, adding:\n\nYet, this is exactly what President Trump did. On his first day back in office, President Trump pardoned 1,500 people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Since then, he’s pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 90 others. Just recently, he added former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to that list. Hernandez was serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle more than 400 tons or 4.5 billion doses of cocaine into the US. Hernandez was also convicted of accepting bribes from violent drug cartel members to fuel his political career, shielding them from prosecution in exchange for their bribes\n\nOlszewski announced Bacon joining his bill, writing, “The Constitution does not give any president the authority to place themselves above the law. I’m proud to have Congressman Bacon join this effort, because safeguarding democracy and upholding justice should never be a partisan issue. When the pardon power is abused to protect criminals and political allies, Congress has a responsibility to act.”\n\nNo more get out of jail free cards for the wealthy and well-connected. pic.twitter.com/kcwDB3RSjy\n\n— Rep. Johnny Olszewski (@RepJohnnyO) December 19, 2025\n\n“This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House,” he added.\n\nBacon, a former Air Force general who is not seeking reelection in his swing district, added, “Presidential pardons are an important constitutional authority, but like all powers held by the executive branch, these authorities benefit from the appropriate checks and balances the Constitution envisioned. Across multiple administrations, we’ve seen legitimate questions raised about how this authority has been used at the same time, the ability of Congress to provide oversight has weakened.\n\n“Frankly, it is clear to me the pardon authority has been abused. I’m pleased to cosponsor Rep. Olszewski’s Pardon Integrity Act, a constitutional amendment that establishes a narrow, commonsense guardrail that preserves the pardon power while ensuring Congress can fulfill its constitutional role to provide accountability and uphold the rule of law,” concluded Bacon in a statement. Bacon’s support for the measure followed Trump’s pardon of several NFL players who had been convicted of various crimes, including drug trafficking.\n\nBacon is also behind a bipartisan bill to return the power to levy tariffs solely to Congress, adhering to the original wording of the Constitution.\n\nThe post Republican Joins With Dems on Constitutional Amendment to Give Congress Power to Reject Trump Pardons first appeared on Mediaite.",

The style hearkens back to the past presidential portrait styles of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Calvin Coolidge, who also appeared unsmiling against dark backgrounds.\n\nAnd while there is no flag behind Trump in his new portrait, he is wearing an American flag pin on the lapel of his blue suit, a tradition that began with President George W. Bush's photo.\n\nA portrait of Trump released earlier last year, which did feature an American flag, was taken during the presidential transition period and \"was always meant to serve as a placeholder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nThe new photo is one of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House in his second non-consecutive term. In the Entrance Hall, he moved President Barack Obama's painted White House portrait across the hall and replaced it with a painting depicting his raised fist following an assassination attempt. He has also added numerous gilded gold furnishings to the Oval Office and paved over the lawn in the Rose Garden to create a terrace he said would be better suited for large events.\n\nTake a look at how presidential portraits have changed through the years.",

In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

    "fullText": "A handful of very wealthy people want to give your children free money.\n\nThis July, the government will officially launch \"Trump Accounts,\" a new investment savings account for children.\n\nParents can contribute up to $5,000 per year to each of their kids' accounts, while employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year.\n\nFor children born between 2025 and 2028, the federal government will provide a $1,000 seed contribution.\n\nBut it's not just the government. Several wealthy individuals have pledged to make further philanthropic contributions to the accounts.\n\nMany of those individuals are \"adopting\" specific states, meaning their contributions are limited to children living in those states.\n\nThe accounts can't be accessed for withdrawals until the child turns 18, at which point they can spend the money on major purchases like tuition or a down payment on a home.\n\nThe goal of it all: getting the next generation invested in capitalism and building wealth.\n\nHere's who's pouring money into Trump Accounts, and which children are eligible.\n\nDell CEO Michael Dell and his wife Susan have pledged to contribute $6.25 billion to the Trump Accounts of children across the country.\n\nSpecifically, the Dells are contributing $250 to 25 million children, including those who are 10 years or younger and live in a ZIP code where the median income is $150,000 or less.\n\nRecipients also must be born before January 1, 2025, meaning the Dells' contributions will go to children who aren't set to receive the $1,000 contribution from the federal government.\n\n\"Together we can make possibility something that every child can count on,\" Michael Dell said in a December video announcing the contribution.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio is \"adopting\" the state of Connecticut.\n\nThe Bridgewater Associates founder and his wife Barbara are planning to contribute $250 to the Trump Accounts of about 300,000 children across the state.\n\nThe contributions will be initially targeted toward children under the age of 10 who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000.\n\n\"Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction,\" Dalio said in a statement in December. \"I have lived the American Dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life.\"\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of the petroleum company Continental Resources, plans to \"adopt\" the state of Oklahoma, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe details of Hamm's planned contributions have not yet been made public, and spokespeople for Continental Resources did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHamm, a billionaire, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump's campaign in 2024.\n\nEven Nicki Minaj says she's contributing to Trump Accounts.\n\nMinaj has indicated that the contributions will go to her fans, but it's not clear how much money she's pouring in.\n\nThe New York Post reported in January that it could be \"between $150,000 and $300,000,\" but that the number was still in flux. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinaj said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast that she became interested when she saw President Trump speaking about the accounts alongside Michael Dell.\n\n\"I was just like, wow. Like, I love this idea,\" Minaj said.\n\n\"My big thing is financial literacy,\" she added. \"You could teach a person everything in the world, but if they don't know how to manage money, if they don't know what the financial world really entails, then they'll get it and lose it.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street's preeminent valuation yardstick offers a worrisome tale for investors.",
    "fullText": "From an investment standpoint, Wall Street is a fan of Donald Trump in the White House. During President Trump's first term in office, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nIn the year and change since he was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term, an encore Trump bull market rally has taken shape. From Jan. 20, 2025, through the closing bell on Feb. 10, 2026, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have, respectively, rallied 15%, 16%, and 18%. Outsize returns have become something of the norm.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are behind this exceptionally strong bull market, some of which can be attributed to Donald Trump, there are also headwinds that can derail this rally. One insurmountable obstacle that has over 150 years of history in its sails is of particular concern.\n\nTo get a bit of housekeeping out of the way, Wall Street's major indexes climbing is nothing new. Since March 1897, there have been 33 presidential terms, 26 of which resulted in a positive return in either the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Most presidents oversee a growing U.S. economy and investment optimism, leading to stock market gains during their tenure -- and Trump has been no exception.\n\nHowever, the early annualized return for President Trump's second term is among the best of any president dating back well over a century. As investors, it pays to understand what's behind this outsize return.\n\nNot all of the stock market's upside catalysts have been influenced by the president. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which began during Joe Biden's presidency, and the advent of quantum computing are playing key roles in lifting the broader market. Analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group estimates quantum computing will create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. These technologies are clearly exciting investors.\n\nLikewise, President Trump had no hand in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates on six occasions since September 2024. Lowering lending rates can encourage corporate borrowing, in turn leading to an increase in hiring, acquisition activity, and capital devoted to innovation.",

    "description": "The changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping set of regulatory proposals that would substantially change health plan offerings on the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year, aiming, it says, to provide more choice and lower premiums. But it also proposes sharply raising some annual out-of-pocket costs — to more than $27,000 for one type of coverage — and could cause up to 2 million people to drop insurance.\n\nThe changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums since enhanced subsidies expired at the end of last year. Initial enrollment numbers for this year fell by more than 1 million.\n\nHealth care coverage and affordability have become politically potent issues in the run-up to November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a lengthy rule that addresses a broad swath of standards, including benefit packages, out-of-pocket costs, and health care provider networks. Insurers refer to these standards when setting premium rates for the coming year.\n\nAfter a comment period, the rule will be finalized this spring.\n\nIt “puts patients, taxpayers, and states first by lowering costs and reinforcing accountability for taxpayer dollars,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz in a Feb. 9 press release.\n\nOne way it would do so focuses heavily on a type of coverage — catastrophic plans — that last year attracted only about 20,000 policyholders, according to the proposal, although other estimates put it closer to 54,000.\n\n“To me, this proposal reads like the administration has found their next big thing in the catastrophic plans,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nSuch plans have very high annual out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder but often lower premiums than other ACA coverage options. Formerly restricted to those under age 30 or facing certain hardships, the Trump administration allowed older people who lost subsidy eligibility to enroll in them for this year. It is not yet known how many people chose to do so.\n\nThe payment rule cements this move by making eligible anyone whose income is below the poverty line ($15,650 for this year) and those earning more than 2.5 times that amount who lost access to an ACA subsidy that lowered their out-of-pocket costs. It also notes that a person meeting these standards would be eligible in any state — an important point because this coverage is currently available in only 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require out-of-pocket maximums on such plans to hit $15,600 a year for an individual and $27,600 for a family, Keith wrote this week in Health Affairs. (The current out-of-pocket max for catastrophic plans is $10,600 for an individual plan and $21,200 for family coverage.) Not counting preventive care and three covered primary care doctor visits, that spending target must be met before a policy’s other coverage kicks in.\n\nIn the rule, the administration wrote that the proposed changes would help differentiate catastrophic from “bronze” plans, the next level up, and, possibly, spur more enrollment in the former. Currently, the proposal said, there may not be a significant difference if premiums are similar. Raising the out-of-pocket maximum for catastrophic plans to those levels would create that difference, the proposal said.\n\n“When there is such a clear difference, the healthier consumers that are generally eligible and best suited to enroll in catastrophic plans are more motivated to select a catastrophic plan in lieu of a bronze plan,” the proposal noted.\n\nHowever, ACA subsidies cannot be used toward catastrophic premiums, which could limit shoppers’ interest.\n\nEnrollment in bronze plans, which currently have an average annual deductible of $7,500, has doubled since 2018 to about 5.4 million last year. This year, that number will likely be higher. Some states’ sign-up data indicates a shift toward bronze as consumers left higher-premium “silver,” “gold,” or “platinum” plans following the expiration of more generous subsidies at the end of last year.\n\nThe proposal also would allow insurers to offer bronze plans with cost-sharing rates that exceed what the ACA law currently allows, but only if that insurer also sells other bronze plans with lower cost-sharing levels.\n\nIn what it calls a “novel” approach, the proposal would allow insurers to offer multiyear catastrophic plans, in which people could stay enrolled for up to 10 years, and their out-of-pocket maximums would vary over that time. Costs might be higher, for example, in the early years, then fall the longer the policy is in place. The proposal specifically asks for comments on how such a plan could be structured and what effect multiyear plans might have on the overall market.\n\n“As we understand it thus far, insurers could offer the policy for one year or for consecutive years, up to 10 years,” said Zach Sherman, managing director for coverage policy and program design at HMA, also known as Health Management Associates, a health policy consulting firm that does work for states and insurance plans. “But the details on how that would work, we are still unpacking.”\n\nMatthew Fiedler, senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said the proposed rule included a lot of provisions that could “expose enrollees to much higher out-of-pocket costs.”\n\nIn addition to the planned changes to bronze and catastrophic plans, he points to another provision that would allow plans to be sold on the ACA exchange that have no set health care provider networks. In other words, the insurer has not contracted with specific doctors and hospitals to accept their coverage. Instead, such plans would pay medical providers a set amount toward medical services, possibly a flat fee or a percentage of what Medicare pays, for example. The rule says insurers would need to ensure “access to a range of providers” willing to accept such amounts as payment in full. Policyholders might be on the hook for unexpected expenses, however, if a clinician or facility doesn’t agree and charges the patient the difference.\n\nBecause the rule is so sweeping — with many other parts — it is expected to draw hundreds, if not thousands, of comments between now and early March.\n\nPennsylvania insurance broker Joshua Brooker said one change he would like to see is requiring insurers that sell the very high out-of-pocket catastrophic plans to offer other catastrophic plans with lower annual maximums.\n\nOverall, though, a wider range of options might appeal to people on both ends of the income scale, he said.\n\nSome wealthier enrollees, especially those who no longer qualify for any ACA premium subsidies, would prefer a lower premium like those expected in catastrophic plans, and could just pay the bills up to that max, he said.\n\n“They’re more worried about the half-million-dollar heart attack,” Brooker said. It’s tougher for people below the poverty level, who don’t qualify for ACA subsidies and, in 10 states, often don’t qualify for Medicaid. So they’re likely to go uninsured. At least a catastrophic plan, he said, might let them get some preventive care coverage and cap their exposure if they end up in a hospital. From there, they might qualify for charity care at the hospital to cover out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOverall, “putting more options on the market doesn’t hurt, as long as it is disclosed properly and the consumer understands it,” he said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made another careful descent of the Air Force One stairs Friday afternoon following his arrival in Palm Beach, Florida, this time clutching Melania’s hand all the way down.\n\nTrump, 79, disembarked with the first lady, and the two then climbed into the Beast, the armored presidential vehicle. Trump is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the de facto winter White House.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what plans—if any—the two had to mark Valentine’s Day; the White House did not respond to the Daily Beast’s question about that.\n\nAs for Trump’s health, spokesperson Davis Ingle sent a recycled statement: “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing ‘reporters’ push baseless conspiracy theories—President Trump spent the day meeting with military families and putting the American people first.”\n\nSince taking office for the second time, Trump has been seen making many cautious descents of both Air Force One and Marine One, which is even less elevated.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who appears to have missed his life as a podcaster, Trump explained that his deliberate steps are to avoid tripping as Joe Biden did in 2021, when the then-president was 78 years old.\n\n“I’ve got to be very careful going in,” Trump said about walking up the stairs. “Ever noticed how slowly I am these days? Nice and slowly—I’m not looking to set any records. You don’t want to go down. Could happen, could happen. But it can’t happen three times in one shot, OK?”\n\nAnother factor at play is how Trump has been seen with swelling around his ankles. In 2025, the White House announced that the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition common in seniors, which makes it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the lower extremities.\n\nTrump takes aspirin—a higher than normal dosage—which acts as a blood thinner. This, combined with his frequent and vigorous handshaking, regularly causes bruising to the president’s hands, according to the White House.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Melania’s grip will have the same effect.",

    "description": "Barack Obama offered a lengthy response to Donald Trump's video depicting the former president and his wife as apes.",
    "fullText": "Barack Obama responded to the racist video posted by Donald Trump’s Truth Social account last week that depicted the former president and his wife, Michelle Obama, as apes. While speaking to Brian Taylor Cohen on the Saturday episode of his podcast, Obama said, “What is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum.”\n\nObama emphasized that it is “important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”\n\nHe continued: “You know, it is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, you know, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people. They still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness. And there’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television.”\n\n“And what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum. And a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? So that’s been lost,” Obama also said.\n\nBut the former president also said he has reason to be hopeful.\n\n“The reason I point out that I don’t think the majority of the American people approve of this is because ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people. And we just saw this in Minnesota and Minneapolis.”\n\nThe “unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis [and] St. Paul” has resulted in “the extraordinary outpouring of organizing, community building, decency, neighbors, buying groceries for folks, accompanying children to school, teachers who were standing up for their kids,” Obama said.\n\n“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, ‘This is not the America we believe in, and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth, and with cameras, and with peaceful protests,’ and shining a light on the sort of behavior that, you know, in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to apologize for the video. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud, and a fairly long video, and they had a little piece that had to do with ‘The Lion King,'” he told reporters this week.\n\nHe continued: “It’s been very well—it’s been shown all over the place, long before that was posted. But that was a very strong, and I’m sure you saw it, very strong piece on voter fraud. And the piece that you’re talking about was all over the place many times, I believe for years.”\n\nReaction to the video was strongly negative on both sides of the aisle, and Trump’s team ultimately deleted it after it was live for 12 hours.\n\nThe post Barack Obama Responds to Trump’s Racist Ape Video: ‘Doesn’t Seem to Be Any Shame’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Pam Bondi wrote in a Saturday letter the DOJ has released \"all\" Epstein-related files and listed a number of \"politically exposed persons\" like Trump and Biden",
    "fullText": "(Photo Credit: Justice Department)\n\nThe Justice Department said it has released “all” files tied to dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, according to a letter sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche to lawmakers on Saturday night.\n\nBondi and Blanche’s letter said the DOJ has fulfilled its obligation to release files as part of the Epstein Transparency Act and outlined why it redacted certain portions.\n\n“In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and [Ghislaine] Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all ‘records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department’ that ‘relate to’ [Epstein],” the letter said.\n\nIt also included a lengthy list of government officials and “politically exposed persons” who were named in the files.\n\nThat list included President Donald Trump, ex-President Joe Biden, Tucker Carlson, Bruce Springsteen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, California Sen. Adam Schiff (D), Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Barack Obama, among many others.\n\n“Names appear in the files released under the Act in a wide variety of contexts,” the letter noted. “For example, some individuals had extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell, while other individuals are mentioned only in a portion of a document (including press reporting) that on its face is unrelated to the Epstein or Maxwell matters.”\n\nThe letter said “No records were withheld or redacted ‘on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.'”\n\nPolitico senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein shared the letter on X; you can read the full six-page document by clicking here.\n\nJUST IN: DOJ sends Hill a letter purporting to fulfill requirement in Epstein Files Transparency Act for an explanation of all redactions from released files. The six-page letter is a lot less detailed than 1 would get in run-of-the-mill #FOIA case. Doc: https://t.co/5PT7HWgJ0N\n\n— Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) February 15, 2026\n\nIt was addressed to Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD).\n\nThe Justice Department, according to the letter, worked “in consultation with victim counsel and victims directly” on what should be redacted in the files. That included “personally indentifiable information of victim or victims’ personal and medical files,” which the letter said “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\nSaturday’s letter comes just days after Bondi was lambasted by a number of Democratic lawmakers — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) — over her handling of Epstein-related files.\n\nRaskin started the hearing off by accusing Bondi of “ignoring” victims and leading a “massive Epstein cover-up” that he said is the biggest failure in Justice Department history.\n\n“You replace real prosecutors with counterfeit stooges who robotically do the president’s bidding,” Raskin said. “Nothing in American history comes close to this complete corruption of the justice function and contamination of federal law enforcement.”\n\nBondi got her own shots in, branding Raskin a “washed-up, loser lawyer” who was a political failure.\n\nThe Saturday letter also comes after the Justice Department released 3.5 million files on Epstein at the end of January. Trump told reporters those files “absolve” him of any wrongdoing, and they included an FBI document showing Trump thanked Florida cops and told them to “focus” on “evil” Maxwell back in 2006, among many other files.\n\nBondi and Blanche did not mention the letter on their social media accounts on Saturday, and there is no mention of more files — or the letter — on the Justice Department’s website.\n\nOther famous names mentioned in the letter include: Massie, George Clooney, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jared Kushner, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Elon Musk, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D), California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D), Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former President Bill Clinton, and former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe DOJ has a dedicated “Epstein Library” hub where it has been releasing all Epstein-related files, which you can scan for yourself by clicking here.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Pam Bondi Says DOJ Released ‘All’ Epstein Files — Names Trump, Biden, Zuckerberg, Tucker Carlson Among ‘Politically Exposed Persons’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"I don't,\" the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Graham offered a blunt and dismissive message to Europeans worried about Donald Trump's vocal plans to take over Greenland\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference\n\nGraham's message comes amid Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, which has strained U.S. relations with NATO allies\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham dismissed worries about President Donald Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, including threats to acquire it by force.\n\nGraham's blunt message came at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13, after journalist Jonathan Martin asked the South Carolina Republican, 70, if he has a message for Europeans in the audience “who are obviously nervous” about Trump’s controversial plans for the NATO territory.\n\nGraham, a Trump ally, first joked about Martin’s question. “Well, if you're nervous, have a beer,” he said. “Go see a doctor. Stop being nervous.”\n\nGraham then downplayed the president’s bid to take over the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark — and which has stressed the United States’ relations with Denmark and other NATO allies.\n\nSharing his actual message to “my European friends,” Graham said, “Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes.”\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the senator continued. “So the point is Greenland is going to be more fortified because Donald Trump, once he feels like it’s his brand or his buy-in, is going to go big.”\n\nWhen he was questioned about Denmark’s relationship with the U.S. amid Trump’s vocal plans to seize control of Greenland, Graham said, “I think we’re good.”\n\n“I think everybody is hugging it out and, you know, we’ll live to fight another day,” he added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nTrump previously linked his loss of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to his desire to seize control of Greenland in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nIn his January letter to Støre, Trump urged the politician to give the U.S. “Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” despite the fact that Støre was not responsible for Trump's Nobel loss, nor does he control the fate of Greenland.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" Trump wrote in the letter.\n\nHe later doubled down on his Greenland plans in a Truth Social post the same day, writing, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!! President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nIn a January interview with The New York Times, Trump said his desire to have ownership of Greenland is \"psychologically important” to him.\n\nStill, reporters questioned why he wouldn't just send more American troops to Greenland if his goal was, as he previously stated, to fend off foreign threats from China and Russia.\n\nAfter Trump told the outlet that ownership of the NATO territory is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success,” the Times' White House correspondent Katie Rogers — whom Trump recently called \"ugly, both inside and out\" for writing a story about his age — asked him to clarify, \"Psychologically important to you or to the United States?\"\n\n“Psychologically important for me,\" Trump replied to Rogers. \"Now, maybe another president would feel differently, but so far I’ve been right about everything.\"",

    "fullText": "Many people bought the devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages\n\nWhat happens to the data that smart home cameras collect? Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.\n\nA Super Bowl ad by the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of the kidnapper of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s mass surveillance apparatus.\n\nRing’s Super Bowl ad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?\n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel; cybersecurity experts have said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in a cloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.\n\n“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nRing, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, telling Wirecutter in a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has also said that the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” the company stated.\n\nThere’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in an open letter on Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to get refunds on old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”\n\nRing appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, but news reports have documented an ongoing loophole: cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.\n\nRing said in a blog post that the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.\n\nData-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ring agreed to pay $5.8m in a settlement with the FTC.\n\nRing still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to be doubling down on its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the company partnered with body-camera maker Axon to restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.\n\n“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.",

    "fullText": "US presidents rode Lincoln limousines for most of the 20th century until the 1980s, when the Reagan administration switched to Cadillacs.\n\nThe latest model of the presidential limousine was commissioned by the US Secret Service in 2014 and used for the first time in 2018 by President Donald Trump.\n\nDesigned to look like a longer version of a Cadillac XT6, the chassis of the car is actually that of a Chevrolet Kodiak truck produced by General Motors, NBC News reported. The vehicle weighs around 20,000 pounds and cost around $1.5 million to build.\n\nWhile details about the limousine's security measures remain classified, NBC News reported that the vehicle features a night-vision system, tear gas firing capabilities, and door handles that can be electrified to prevent intruders.\n\nThe windows are believed to be 3 inches thick, and the vehicle's armor is around 8 inches thick.\n\nThe limousine's secure communications system can dispatch the launch codes for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe seal, featuring an eagle holding an olive branch and 13 arrows in its talons below a banner reading \"E Pluribus Unum\" (\"Out of many, one\"), appears on both the interior and exterior of the passenger door.\n\nThe interior features water bottle holders and plush leather seats. Previous presidential limousines have also included a fold-out desk, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nPresidential limousines are transported by military cargo aircraft, such as US Air Force C-17s, for use during the president's travels, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nSome presidents have used the Washington, DC, \"End Taxation Without Representation\" license plates, while others have removed the slogan.\n\nBiden and Trump rode to the 2025 inauguration ceremony together in the presidential limousine.\n\nAhead of a meeting on August 15, 2025, to discuss the war in Ukraine, Trump and Putin unexpectedly rode in the car together. The ride lasted fewer than 10 minutes and offered the leaders the opportunity to talk privately. Putin was seen smiling from within the vehicle.\n\n\"It is safe to say that this car's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world,\" the assistant director for the US Secret Service's Office of Protective Operations said in a statement on the organization's official website.",

    "fullText": "Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton has publicly responded after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, closing a chapter that has followed him for more than two decades.\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion did not hesitate in expressing gratitude.\n\nIn a statement shared on X, Newton addressed the current US president directly.\n\n“I would like to thank President Trump and all of those that work under him who put this Pardon into effect.\n\n“Thank you, sir, for taking time out of your busy day in running this country. Thank you, sincerely, and may God bless you,” Newton tweeted.\n\nThe tone was formal and deliberate, signaling that Newton views the pardon as deeply significant.\n\nFor a player who helped anchor one of the NFL’s most dominant offensive lines in the 1990s, the message represented more than political alignment. It marked acknowledgment of a past that has long complicated his legacy.\n\nNewton’s playing career ended in the late 1990s, but his life took a darker turn in 2001 when he pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges.\n\nHe later served nearly two years in prison, a period that reshaped both his public image and personal trajectory.\n\nThe presidential pardon does not erase that history. It does not rewrite court records or undo the conviction.\n\nWhat it does provide is formal forgiveness at the federal level, restoring certain civil privileges and signaling that the government considers the debt paid. For Newton, that distinction matters.\n\nHis on-field achievements, including three Super Bowl rings, were never in question. What lingered was the stain of a post-career collapse that overshadowed those accomplishments.\n\nThe pardon reframes the narrative from downfall to redemption. Public reaction will inevitably vary, but Newton’s focus was clear. Gratitude, not debate. After decades defined by dominance, disgrace and now clemency, his story has taken another turn.\n\nJesse Ventura almost resigned from WWE Hall of Fame over Donald Trump induction in 2013\n\nAOC responds to Donald Trump saying he didn’t understand Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "title": "Fact Check: Trump's White House ballroom project was allegedly scrapped. We broke down real status",
    "description": "A federal judge is expected to rule in February 2026 on whether the construction can continue.",
    "fullText": "The construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom was halted by a federal judge in mid-February 2026.\n\nAs of this writing, a federal judge has yet to rule on the legal status of the construction project. In a social media post, Trump stated that the project is moving \"ahead of schedule,\" while a White House spokesperson told us that the project is still in the \"demolition phase.\"\n\nA social media rumor that emerged around Feb. 10, 2026, claimed a federal judge had halted U.S. President Donald Trump's White House ballroom construction project.\n\nTrump began the demolition of the White House's East Wing in October 2025 in order to replace it with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. In December 2025, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, arguing the project began without necessary approvals or congressional authority.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, numerous readers asked us to confirm whether a federal judge had halted construction on the ballroom. A Feb. 10 Facebook post stated:\n\nTrump's infamous new White House ballroom and bunker has been scrapped by a federal judge and the national trust preservation committee. It was also discovered the $400 million in ballroom donor money has either disappeared or simply never existed. 🤔\n\nThe image of the White House (below) shows the former site of the East Wing, built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, completely demolished with several bulldozers and skip loaders clearing the last of the rubble.\n\nGSA has to now hire a construction company to fill the east wing (trump improperly had demolished) with dirt and sod. The Judge and committee have also ruled trump \"cannot as much as paint a wall in the white house without a permit and committee approval\".\n\nAs of this writing, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, the judge overseeing the case, had yet to issue a decision on the status of the ballroom construction project. We reached out to the White House; a spokesperson told us the ballroom was not yet being constructed and the project was still in the \"demolition stage.\"\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that a judge has halted the construction as false. We will update the story when the court releases a decision.\n\nThe National Trust argued that the project proceeded without receiving authorization from Congress and with inadequate environmental assessments.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, Leon denied the National Trust's motion for a temporary restraining order on the project and temporarily allowed work to continue. The judge's order noted that because the ballroom plans had not been finalized, there was no \"imminent risk of irreparable aesthetic harm.\"\n\nAccording to arguments filed by the Trump administration in January 2026, previous presidents did not require congressional approval to carry out construction or renovations on White House grounds. The government also said above-ground construction would not begin until April 2026.\n\nIn late January 2026, Leon expressed skepticism that the administration had the legal authority to tear down the East Wing and proceed with construction. However, he said he would make a decision in the coming weeks, likely in February 2026, on whether or not to allow a preliminary injunction, which would stop the construction work for the duration of the case.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's reporting, Leon predicted the issue would also be appealed to a federal appeals court and possibly the Supreme Court. According to court records viewed on Feb. 12, Leon had not issued such an injunction.\n\nThe White House didn't specify how much money it had raised and who the private donors were, directing us to Trump's most recent statement instead. On Feb. 10, 2026, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the construction project \"is on budget, and ahead of schedule.\" He also shared digital renderings of what the potential ballroom would look like.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump posted that the project was privately funded and would cost $300 million to $400 million dollars:\n\nI'm building, on top of everything else that I am doing, one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World, with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots' money, and working closely with, right from the beginning, the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America, of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!), for a desperately needed space [...]\n\nIn November 2025, the White House released a list of donors for the ballroom project, which included charitable organizations, sports team owners, tech companies, media companies and billionaires. The Associated Press reported an additional corporation as well as an artificial intelligence chipmaker that also donated to the project. The administration did not reveal how much each donor contributed.\n\nSnopes has covered numerous claims on the East Wing demolition and Trump's plans for a White House ballroom.\n\n\"A Crane Used in the Ballroom Construction Hovers above The White...\" Getty Images, 10 Feb. 2026, https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crane-used-in-the-ballroom-construction-hovers-above-the-news-photo/2260298495.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a new riff on his election lies by telling troops that he won the popular vote in 2016 “by a lot” — thereby inventing millions of votes he did not win.\n\nTrump has spent years falsely claiming that the 2020 election was “rigged” against him and/or “stolen” from him, despite the fact that Biden defeated Trump in an electoral landslide that has been reaffirmed over and over by state officials from Trump’s own party and dozens of court decisions.\n\nBut he won the 2016 election despite losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.\n\nThe president departed the White House Friday afternoon en route to Fort Bragg ahead of a long weekend at his Mar-a-lago resort. In Texas, he gave a speech to military families that included many familiar touches — and one new one.\n\nDuring an introduction, Trump flatly declared that he won the popular vote “by a lot” — and without the qualifiers he has used in the past:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And he was responsible, along with Laura Trump. Laura is fantastic. Born here and loves the area, but they work together.\n\nBut Michael Watley, if he’s here, I don’t know. Michael, Michael. Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re going to be taken care of.\n\nIf he doesn’t get in, we’re going to be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats. This is a man who was the head of North Carolina. And so he did so well that I said. Who was that guy that did so well?\n\nBecause when it came time to picking the head of the Republican Party, I picked him. And you saw what happened in the last election. We won at a landslide. We won every swing state, all seven swing states.\n\nWe won by millions of votes, the popular vote.\n\nYou know, the first time I won, but they say I didn’t win the popular vote, you know I did. I won it by a lot, but they said I didn’t.\n\nSo every time they’d introduce “Donald Trump, who didn’t won the popular vote,” but he, you know, whatever.\n\nThis — I was always — I said, I don’t ever want that to happen again. But we did. We won everything.\n\nAnd this is a man that was in charge of this state. He did so well here. There was nobody else that I even considered to run the RNC. That’s the whole country.\n\nAnd we had a big, big victory just recently that you know very well — a victory like they’ve never seen. So I’d just like you to say a couple of words, Michael. Congratulations.\n\nThe post Trump Drops Brand-New Election Whopper In Riff To Troops — Invents Millions of Votes He Never Got first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.\n\nTrump posted a video to his Truth Social account last week that contained an image depicting President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes:\n\nThe post drew widespread outrage including from Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”\n\nAfter 12 hours or so, the post was deleted, with an unnamed White House official claiming “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nBut a week later, Trump is back to defending it, and according to CNN’s Alayna Treene is out for revenge against Scott and others who called him out.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Treene told host Anderson Cooper that Trump is raging privately about Scott and Sen. Katie Britt ( for their perceived disloyalty:\n\nANDERSON COOPER: According to new reporting, there may be repercussions for some Republican lawmakers, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who’s black. He called the Obama post, quote, the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House, seen as Alayna Treene has the story joins us now.\n\nSo Alayna, you’re reporting that the president has talked about consequences for Republicans who push back on the post. Is it clear what that means?\n\nALAYNA TREENE: Not necessarily, but we have a good idea, Anderson, from what we’ve even heard the president say this week when we saw six Republicans break with him on a different issue, on his tariffs on Canada.\n\nHe said that they would likely face primaries and would suffer consequences in the elections.\n\nBut look, from what I was told from multiple sources who were with the president or had been hearing about these comments last weekend when he was at Mar-a-Lago is he was specifically focused on two lawmakers.\n\nHe had railed against a lot of them, but Tim Scott in particular really got under his skin that he had spoken out publicly about that post.\n\nThe president telling his allies essentially that he felt Tim Scott should have reached out privately given they have a close relationship. That it was really Scott’s post calling it racist that he felt made the entire story blow up.\n\nI will say from another conversation I had with the source, they said that Tim Scott had actually privately reached out to the president first before he had posted that criticism of the post, but then didn’t reach him. And so he went ahead and published it on social media.\n\nNow, the president also had pretty strong words. I was told even stronger language for Alabama Senator Katie Britt, who had also spoken out about this.\n\nHe had used a lot of expletives, I was told, when talking about her lack of loyalty in doing that.\n\nAnd also said that she was dead to him.\n\nSo very, very much anger from the president over how some of these lawmakers had reacted.\n\nAnd I do think it reflects kind of this growing, a sense that we’re seeing of Republicans who, for the president’s first year in office, really rarely, if at all, stepped out of line to break with him. We’re seeing that happen more and \n\nWatch above via Anderson Cooper 360.\n\nThe post ‘Dead To Me!’ Trump In Profane Frothing Rage At Allies Who Slammed Racist Video Say CNN White House Sources first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in what could become a ‌far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.\n\nThe disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due ‌to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nU.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in ​an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.\n\nU.S. officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.\n\nTrump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had \"been difficult ‌to make a deal\" with Iran.\n\n\"Sometimes you have ⁠to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained U.S. military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"President Trump has ⁠all options on the table with regard to Iran.\"\n\n\"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nThe United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when ​it ​carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHowever, June's \"Midnight Hammer\" operation was essentially a ​one-off U.S. attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United ‌States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nThe planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.\n\nIn a sustained campaign, the U.S. military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.\n\nExperts say the risks to U.S. forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nThe same official said the ‌United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals ​over a period of time.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about ​the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened ​to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned ‌the alternative to a diplomatic solution would \"be very traumatic, very ​traumatic.\"\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that ​in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks ​in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an ‌agreement with Iran were reached, \"it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.\"\n\nIran has said it is prepared to discuss ​curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "description": "Fox News analyst Andrew McCarthy says Justice Department's failed attempt to charge six Democratic members of Congress amounts to intolerable abuse of power.",
    "fullText": "A conservative lawyer issued a blistering takedown of President Donald Trump’s attempt to prosecute six Democratic members of Congress.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a Fox News legal analyst and National Review editor, said an effort by the Justice Department to criminally charge the Democrats made another Trump impeachment more likely.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\n\n“The president will be impeached promptly if Democrats retake control of the House after the November midterms, an outcome his abuses of power have also made highly likely,” McCarthy wrote in a column published in the National Review Wednesday.\n\n“That will be the legacy of yesterday’s reported failed attempt by the Trump Justice Department to criminally charge the ‘Seditious Six,’ as the Democrats in question were labeled by Trump supporters.”\n\nMcCarthy personally characterized Trump’s attacks on the six Democrats as “intolerable” and “impeachable.” He wrote that there was “no plausible justification for the proposed indictment” against Sens. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.), Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) and Chris Deluzio (Pa.).\n\nThose Democrats were targeted by Trump last year after they posted a joint video reminding active-duty members of the military and intelligence community of their duty to refuse unlawful orders. Trump called for the Democrats to face arrest, posting on Truth Social that their message amounted to “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n\nOn Tuesday, federal prosecutors argued to a Washington grand jury that the Democratic lawmakers had violated a federal statute prohibiting interference with the loyalty, morale or discipline of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe grand jury declined to approve the charges sought by U.S. attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro’s office.\n\nMcCarthy wrote that the Democrats had committed “no crime at all.” He went on to condemn Trump for using the criminal justice system to target political rivals.\n\n“More even than capricious tariffs, the president’s signature policy is bullying lawfare — the tin-pot dictator-style expliitation of law-enforcement power to punish political enemies and scapegoats and to settle old scores,\" McCarthy wrote.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have also spoken out in defense of their colleagues, sounding the same alarms as McCarthy.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Trump’s use of the DOJ to target lawmakers could threaten the rule of law.\n\n“The fact that they failed to incarcerate a United States senator should not obviate our outrage. They tried to incarcerate two of us,” Schatz said. “I am not entirely sure the United States Senate can survive this if we do not have Republicans standing up.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nNew poll: Trump says Greenland is ‘gonna want us,’ but do Americans want Greenland?\n\nGOP lawmaker raises eyebrows while praising Trump: ‘Whenever he leaves’\n\nJimmy Kimmel wants to rebrand the Epstein files. And Trump won’t like it.",
