    "fullText": "A MAGA senator was called out after he tied himself in knots over Donald Trump’s efforts to imprison two of his Senate colleagues for a video in which they quoted the Military Code of Justice. A grand jury refused last week to indict six Democratic members of Congress, including Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, for interfering with the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the U.S. armed forces after they released a video reminding service members that they had a duty to disobey illegal orders. Trump had previously accused the lawmakers, all of whom have military or intelligence backgrounds, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” but several Senate Republicans called the attempted indictment “chilling” and said the administration’s “political warfare” needs to stop.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's official White House portrait does not feature an American flag in the background — it's the first presidential photo in over 60 years without one.\n\nTaken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, the dramatically lit photo shows Trump against a dark backdrop with a serious expression. The style hearkens back to the past presidential portrait styles of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Calvin Coolidge, who also appeared unsmiling against dark backgrounds.\n\nAnd while there is no flag behind Trump in his new portrait, he is wearing an American flag pin on the lapel of his blue suit, a tradition that began with President George W. Bush's photo.\n\nA portrait of Trump released earlier last year, which did feature an American flag, was taken during the presidential transition period and \"was always meant to serve as a placeholder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nThe new photo is one of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House in his second non-consecutive term. In the Entrance Hall, he moved President Barack Obama's painted White House portrait across the hall and replaced it with a painting depicting his raised fist following an assassination attempt. He has also added numerous gilded gold furnishings to the Oval Office and paved over the lawn in the Rose Garden to create a terrace he said would be better suited for large events.\n\nTake a look at how presidential portraits have changed through the years.",

In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

A representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinaj said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast that she became interested when she saw President Trump speaking about the accounts alongside Michael Dell.\n\n\"I was just like, wow. Like, I love this idea,\" Minaj said.\n\n\"My big thing is financial literacy,\" she added. \"You could teach a person everything in the world, but if they don't know how to manage money, if they don't know what the financial world really entails, then they'll get it and lose it.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street's preeminent valuation yardstick offers a worrisome tale for investors.",
    "fullText": "From an investment standpoint, Wall Street is a fan of Donald Trump in the White House. During President Trump's first term in office, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nIn the year and change since he was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term, an encore Trump bull market rally has taken shape. From Jan. 20, 2025, through the closing bell on Feb. 10, 2026, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have, respectively, rallied 15%, 16%, and 18%. Outsize returns have become something of the norm.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are behind this exceptionally strong bull market, some of which can be attributed to Donald Trump, there are also headwinds that can derail this rally. One insurmountable obstacle that has over 150 years of history in its sails is of particular concern.\n\nTo get a bit of housekeeping out of the way, Wall Street's major indexes climbing is nothing new. Since March 1897, there have been 33 presidential terms, 26 of which resulted in a positive return in either the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Most presidents oversee a growing U.S. economy and investment optimism, leading to stock market gains during their tenure -- and Trump has been no exception.\n\nHowever, the early annualized return for President Trump's second term is among the best of any president dating back well over a century. As investors, it pays to understand what's behind this outsize return.\n\nNot all of the stock market's upside catalysts have been influenced by the president. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which began during Joe Biden's presidency, and the advent of quantum computing are playing key roles in lifting the broader market. Analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group estimates quantum computing will create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. These technologies are clearly exciting investors.\n\nLikewise, President Trump had no hand in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates on six occasions since September 2024. Lowering lending rates can encourage corporate borrowing, in turn leading to an increase in hiring, acquisition activity, and capital devoted to innovation.",

    "description": "The changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping set of regulatory proposals that would substantially change health plan offerings on the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year, aiming, it says, to provide more choice and lower premiums. But it also proposes sharply raising some annual out-of-pocket costs — to more than $27,000 for one type of coverage — and could cause up to 2 million people to drop insurance.\n\nThe changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums since enhanced subsidies expired at the end of last year. Initial enrollment numbers for this year fell by more than 1 million.\n\nHealth care coverage and affordability have become politically potent issues in the run-up to November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a lengthy rule that addresses a broad swath of standards, including benefit packages, out-of-pocket costs, and health care provider networks. Insurers refer to these standards when setting premium rates for the coming year.\n\nAfter a comment period, the rule will be finalized this spring.\n\nIt “puts patients, taxpayers, and states first by lowering costs and reinforcing accountability for taxpayer dollars,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz in a Feb. 9 press release.\n\nOne way it would do so focuses heavily on a type of coverage — catastrophic plans — that last year attracted only about 20,000 policyholders, according to the proposal, although other estimates put it closer to 54,000.\n\n“To me, this proposal reads like the administration has found their next big thing in the catastrophic plans,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nSuch plans have very high annual out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder but often lower premiums than other ACA coverage options. Formerly restricted to those under age 30 or facing certain hardships, the Trump administration allowed older people who lost subsidy eligibility to enroll in them for this year. It is not yet known how many people chose to do so.\n\nThe payment rule cements this move by making eligible anyone whose income is below the poverty line ($15,650 for this year) and those earning more than 2.5 times that amount who lost access to an ACA subsidy that lowered their out-of-pocket costs. It also notes that a person meeting these standards would be eligible in any state — an important point because this coverage is currently available in only 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require out-of-pocket maximums on such plans to hit $15,600 a year for an individual and $27,600 for a family, Keith wrote this week in Health Affairs. (The current out-of-pocket max for catastrophic plans is $10,600 for an individual plan and $21,200 for family coverage.) Not counting preventive care and three covered primary care doctor visits, that spending target must be met before a policy’s other coverage kicks in.\n\nIn the rule, the administration wrote that the proposed changes would help differentiate catastrophic from “bronze” plans, the next level up, and, possibly, spur more enrollment in the former. Currently, the proposal said, there may not be a significant difference if premiums are similar. Raising the out-of-pocket maximum for catastrophic plans to those levels would create that difference, the proposal said.\n\n“When there is such a clear difference, the healthier consumers that are generally eligible and best suited to enroll in catastrophic plans are more motivated to select a catastrophic plan in lieu of a bronze plan,” the proposal noted.\n\nHowever, ACA subsidies cannot be used toward catastrophic premiums, which could limit shoppers’ interest.\n\nEnrollment in bronze plans, which currently have an average annual deductible of $7,500, has doubled since 2018 to about 5.4 million last year. This year, that number will likely be higher. Some states’ sign-up data indicates a shift toward bronze as consumers left higher-premium “silver,” “gold,” or “platinum” plans following the expiration of more generous subsidies at the end of last year.\n\nThe proposal also would allow insurers to offer bronze plans with cost-sharing rates that exceed what the ACA law currently allows, but only if that insurer also sells other bronze plans with lower cost-sharing levels.\n\nIn what it calls a “novel” approach, the proposal would allow insurers to offer multiyear catastrophic plans, in which people could stay enrolled for up to 10 years, and their out-of-pocket maximums would vary over that time. Costs might be higher, for example, in the early years, then fall the longer the policy is in place. The proposal specifically asks for comments on how such a plan could be structured and what effect multiyear plans might have on the overall market.\n\n“As we understand it thus far, insurers could offer the policy for one year or for consecutive years, up to 10 years,” said Zach Sherman, managing director for coverage policy and program design at HMA, also known as Health Management Associates, a health policy consulting firm that does work for states and insurance plans. “But the details on how that would work, we are still unpacking.”\n\nMatthew Fiedler, senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said the proposed rule included a lot of provisions that could “expose enrollees to much higher out-of-pocket costs.”\n\nIn addition to the planned changes to bronze and catastrophic plans, he points to another provision that would allow plans to be sold on the ACA exchange that have no set health care provider networks. In other words, the insurer has not contracted with specific doctors and hospitals to accept their coverage. Instead, such plans would pay medical providers a set amount toward medical services, possibly a flat fee or a percentage of what Medicare pays, for example. The rule says insurers would need to ensure “access to a range of providers” willing to accept such amounts as payment in full. Policyholders might be on the hook for unexpected expenses, however, if a clinician or facility doesn’t agree and charges the patient the difference.\n\nBecause the rule is so sweeping — with many other parts — it is expected to draw hundreds, if not thousands, of comments between now and early March.\n\nPennsylvania insurance broker Joshua Brooker said one change he would like to see is requiring insurers that sell the very high out-of-pocket catastrophic plans to offer other catastrophic plans with lower annual maximums.\n\nOverall, though, a wider range of options might appeal to people on both ends of the income scale, he said.\n\nSome wealthier enrollees, especially those who no longer qualify for any ACA premium subsidies, would prefer a lower premium like those expected in catastrophic plans, and could just pay the bills up to that max, he said.\n\n“They’re more worried about the half-million-dollar heart attack,” Brooker said. It’s tougher for people below the poverty level, who don’t qualify for ACA subsidies and, in 10 states, often don’t qualify for Medicaid. So they’re likely to go uninsured. At least a catastrophic plan, he said, might let them get some preventive care coverage and cap their exposure if they end up in a hospital. From there, they might qualify for charity care at the hospital to cover out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOverall, “putting more options on the market doesn’t hurt, as long as it is disclosed properly and the consumer understands it,” he said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "From Costco to Toyota, global companies are filing lawsuits to secure tariff refunds should the Supreme Court decide to strike down Trump's duties.",
    "fullText": "Top global companies want their money back from the Trump administration.\n\nThe Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether Trump's tariffs enacted under an emergency law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, are legal. To companies that may have already paid billions in duties over the past year, a ruling against tariffs may not be enough to recoup funds.\n\nSmall businesses mainly spearheaded the initial wave of lawsuits against tariffs, but some of the largest global corporations are now filing lawsuits in fear that they may not be refunded should the Supreme Court overturn the duties.\n\nTypically, duties paid to the Customs and Border Protection undergo a process called liquidation within a year of the entry of the goods in question. Once liquidation occurs, the chances of getting any money back become slim — and for many companies, their time is running out.\n\nFrom Costco to Toyota, here are some of the largest global companies that want their tariffs refunded.\n\nCostco is seeking a \"full refund\" of tariffs it paid under the IEEPA, arguing the levies were imposed illegally and could soon become unrecoverable.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed with the Court of International Trade in December 2025, Costco's lawyers argued that the law, first enacted in 1977, has never authorized tariffs.\n\n\"The text of IEEPA does not use the word 'tariff' or any term of equivalent meaning,\" the company wrote.\n\nThe company also said in the complaint that it filed its own suit because even if the Supreme Court ultimately rules the tariffs unlawful, importers are not guaranteed refunds without separate court judgments. Costco said that its imports could begin entering \"liquidation\" as early as mid-December, which is a customs process that could permanently close the door on refunds. Customs has already declined to extend that timeline, Costco said in the suit.\n\nCostco did not disclose how much it has paid in duties.\n\nSubsidiaries of the Toyota Group, Toyota Tsusho America, Toyota Tsusho Canada, and Toyota Tsusho Nexty Electronics America filed a lawsuit in November 2025 to secure refunds.\n\n\"And this action is necessary now because the entries for which Plaintiffs paid tariffs imposed under authority of IEEPA will begin to become liquidated and final as a matter of law by January 31, 2026,\" the companies wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"Plaintiffs seek relief from the impending final liquidations to ensure that their right to a complete refund is not jeopardized,\" they added.\n\nThe auto sector has been among the industries most exposed to Trump's tariffs, which added duties on vehicles as well as on steel and aluminum. In May 2025, Toyota said that the higher import and export rates could cost the company about $1.3 billion over a two-month period.\n\nBYD's lawsuit marks the first from a Chinese carmaker against Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe EV giant filed the suit on February 9 and detailed nine executive orders related to trade that affected the company, including tariffs on cars, auto parts, aluminum, steel, and exports from China.\n\nIn the complaint, BYD wrote that it is seeking a refund of \"all IEEPA tariffs paid to date\" and \"all IEEPA tariffs that may be paid in the future.\"\n\nThe company also said that aside from China, its imports into the US from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and Poland were also affected.\n\nThe Chinese carmaker does not sell passenger cars in the US, but its business here includes buses, commercial vehicles, batteries, energy storage systems, and solar panels. According to its website, the company's truck plant in Lancaster, California, employs 750 workers.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, Goodyear Tire & Rubber filed its complaint and request for relief, and detailed how tariffs, especially the ones imposed on China, which changed nearly a dozen times, affected the company.\n\n\"Where CBP acts in a ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion) in imposing a duty, the entry's liquidation cannot be protested,\" wrote Goodyear in its complaint as to why the company is asking the court to block liquidation.\n\nGoodyear sources a significant portion of its raw materials from Southeast Asia, where the rubber plant is widely commercially grown. According to Goodyear's website, the company's manufacturing facilities are located across 23 countries, including China, the US, Germany, Poland, and Thailand.\n\nAlcoa Corp, one of the world's top producers of aluminum, bauxite, and alumina, filed a complaint for tariff refunds on November 26, 2025.\n\nThis case is one of several dozen that were consolidated with AGS Company Automotive Solutions v. United States Customs and Border Protection, which became the lead case regarding IEEPA duty liquidation as of December 2025.\n\nAs of June 2025, tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports increased to 50%.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made another careful descent of the Air Force One stairs Friday afternoon following his arrival in Palm Beach, Florida, this time clutching Melania’s hand all the way down.\n\nTrump, 79, disembarked with the first lady, and the two then climbed into the Beast, the armored presidential vehicle. Trump is spending the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the de facto winter White House.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what plans—if any—the two had to mark Valentine’s Day; the White House did not respond to the Daily Beast’s question about that.\n\nAs for Trump’s health, spokesperson Davis Ingle sent a recycled statement: “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing ‘reporters’ push baseless conspiracy theories—President Trump spent the day meeting with military families and putting the American people first.”\n\nSince taking office for the second time, Trump has been seen making many cautious descents of both Air Force One and Marine One, which is even less elevated.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who appears to have missed his life as a podcaster, Trump explained that his deliberate steps are to avoid tripping as Joe Biden did in 2021, when the then-president was 78 years old.\n\n“I’ve got to be very careful going in,” Trump said about walking up the stairs. “Ever noticed how slowly I am these days? Nice and slowly—I’m not looking to set any records. You don’t want to go down. Could happen, could happen. But it can’t happen three times in one shot, OK?”\n\nAnother factor at play is how Trump has been seen with swelling around his ankles. In 2025, the White House announced that the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition common in seniors, which makes it difficult for blood to return to the heart from the lower extremities.\n\nTrump takes aspirin—a higher than normal dosage—which acts as a blood thinner. This, combined with his frequent and vigorous handshaking, regularly causes bruising to the president’s hands, according to the White House.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Melania’s grip will have the same effect.",

    "description": "Barack Obama offered a lengthy response to Donald Trump's video depicting the former president and his wife as apes.",
    "fullText": "Barack Obama responded to the racist video posted by Donald Trump’s Truth Social account last week that depicted the former president and his wife, Michelle Obama, as apes. While speaking to Brian Taylor Cohen on the Saturday episode of his podcast, Obama said, “What is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum.”\n\nObama emphasized that it is “important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”\n\nHe continued: “You know, it is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, you know, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people. They still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness. And there’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television.”\n\n“And what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum. And a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? So that’s been lost,” Obama also said.\n\nBut the former president also said he has reason to be hopeful.\n\n“The reason I point out that I don’t think the majority of the American people approve of this is because ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people. And we just saw this in Minnesota and Minneapolis.”\n\nThe “unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis [and] St. Paul” has resulted in “the extraordinary outpouring of organizing, community building, decency, neighbors, buying groceries for folks, accompanying children to school, teachers who were standing up for their kids,” Obama said.\n\n“Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, ‘This is not the America we believe in, and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth, and with cameras, and with peaceful protests,’ and shining a light on the sort of behavior that, you know, in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships, but we have not seen in America.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly refused to apologize for the video. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud, and a fairly long video, and they had a little piece that had to do with ‘The Lion King,'” he told reporters this week.\n\nHe continued: “It’s been very well—it’s been shown all over the place, long before that was posted. But that was a very strong, and I’m sure you saw it, very strong piece on voter fraud. And the piece that you’re talking about was all over the place many times, I believe for years.”\n\nReaction to the video was strongly negative on both sides of the aisle, and Trump’s team ultimately deleted it after it was live for 12 hours.\n\nThe post Barack Obama Responds to Trump’s Racist Ape Video: ‘Doesn’t Seem to Be Any Shame’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Pam Bondi wrote in a Saturday letter the DOJ has released \"all\" Epstein-related files and listed a number of \"politically exposed persons\" like Trump and Biden",
    "fullText": "(Photo Credit: Justice Department)\n\nThe Justice Department said it has released “all” files tied to dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, according to a letter sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy AG Todd Blanche to lawmakers on Saturday night.\n\nBondi and Blanche’s letter said the DOJ has fulfilled its obligation to release files as part of the Epstein Transparency Act and outlined why it redacted certain portions.\n\n“In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and [Ghislaine] Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all ‘records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department’ that ‘relate to’ [Epstein],” the letter said.\n\nIt also included a lengthy list of government officials and “politically exposed persons” who were named in the files.\n\nThat list included President Donald Trump, ex-President Joe Biden, Tucker Carlson, Bruce Springsteen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, California Sen. Adam Schiff (D), Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Barbra Streisand, ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Barack Obama, among many others.\n\n“Names appear in the files released under the Act in a wide variety of contexts,” the letter noted. “For example, some individuals had extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell, while other individuals are mentioned only in a portion of a document (including press reporting) that on its face is unrelated to the Epstein or Maxwell matters.”\n\nThe letter said “No records were withheld or redacted ‘on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.'”\n\nPolitico senior legal affairs reporter Josh Gerstein shared the letter on X; you can read the full six-page document by clicking here.\n\nJUST IN: DOJ sends Hill a letter purporting to fulfill requirement in Epstein Files Transparency Act for an explanation of all redactions from released files. The six-page letter is a lot less detailed than 1 would get in run-of-the-mill #FOIA case. Doc: https://t.co/5PT7HWgJ0N\n\n— Josh Gerstein (@joshgerstein) February 15, 2026\n\nIt was addressed to Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD).\n\nThe Justice Department, according to the letter, worked “in consultation with victim counsel and victims directly” on what should be redacted in the files. That included “personally indentifiable information of victim or victims’ personal and medical files,” which the letter said “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n\nSaturday’s letter comes just days after Bondi was lambasted by a number of Democratic lawmakers — and Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) — over her handling of Epstein-related files.\n\nRaskin started the hearing off by accusing Bondi of “ignoring” victims and leading a “massive Epstein cover-up” that he said is the biggest failure in Justice Department history.\n\n“You replace real prosecutors with counterfeit stooges who robotically do the president’s bidding,” Raskin said. “Nothing in American history comes close to this complete corruption of the justice function and contamination of federal law enforcement.”\n\nBondi got her own shots in, branding Raskin a “washed-up, loser lawyer” who was a political failure.\n\nThe Saturday letter also comes after the Justice Department released 3.5 million files on Epstein at the end of January. Trump told reporters those files “absolve” him of any wrongdoing, and they included an FBI document showing Trump thanked Florida cops and told them to “focus” on “evil” Maxwell back in 2006, among many other files.\n\nBondi and Blanche did not mention the letter on their social media accounts on Saturday, and there is no mention of more files — or the letter — on the Justice Department’s website.\n\nOther famous names mentioned in the letter include: Massie, George Clooney, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jared Kushner, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Elon Musk, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D), California Rep. Eric Swalwell (D), Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former President Bill Clinton, and former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThe DOJ has a dedicated “Epstein Library” hub where it has been releasing all Epstein-related files, which you can scan for yourself by clicking here.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Pam Bondi Says DOJ Released ‘All’ Epstein Files — Names Trump, Biden, Zuckerberg, Tucker Carlson Among ‘Politically Exposed Persons’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"I don't,\" the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference",
    "fullText": "Lindsey Graham offered a blunt and dismissive message to Europeans worried about Donald Trump's vocal plans to take over Greenland\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the South Carolina senator said at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference\n\nGraham's message comes amid Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, which has strained U.S. relations with NATO allies\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham dismissed worries about President Donald Trump's quest for full “ownership” of Greenland, including threats to acquire it by force.\n\nGraham's blunt message came at POLITICO’s 2026 Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13, after journalist Jonathan Martin asked the South Carolina Republican, 70, if he has a message for Europeans in the audience “who are obviously nervous” about Trump’s controversial plans for the NATO territory.\n\nGraham, a Trump ally, first joked about Martin’s question. “Well, if you're nervous, have a beer,” he said. “Go see a doctor. Stop being nervous.”\n\nGraham then downplayed the president’s bid to take over the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark — and which has stressed the United States’ relations with Denmark and other NATO allies.\n\nSharing his actual message to “my European friends,” Graham said, “Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes.”\n\n“Who gives a s--- who owns Greenland? I don’t,” the senator continued. “So the point is Greenland is going to be more fortified because Donald Trump, once he feels like it’s his brand or his buy-in, is going to go big.”\n\nWhen he was questioned about Denmark’s relationship with the U.S. amid Trump’s vocal plans to seize control of Greenland, Graham said, “I think we’re good.”\n\n“I think everybody is hugging it out and, you know, we’ll live to fight another day,” he added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nTrump previously linked his loss of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to his desire to seize control of Greenland in a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nIn his January letter to Støre, Trump urged the politician to give the U.S. “Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” despite the fact that Støre was not responsible for Trump's Nobel loss, nor does he control the fate of Greenland.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States,\" Trump wrote in the letter.\n\nHe later doubled down on his Greenland plans in a Truth Social post the same day, writing, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!! President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nIn a January interview with The New York Times, Trump said his desire to have ownership of Greenland is \"psychologically important” to him.\n\nStill, reporters questioned why he wouldn't just send more American troops to Greenland if his goal was, as he previously stated, to fend off foreign threats from China and Russia.\n\nAfter Trump told the outlet that ownership of the NATO territory is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success,” the Times' White House correspondent Katie Rogers — whom Trump recently called \"ugly, both inside and out\" for writing a story about his age — asked him to clarify, \"Psychologically important to you or to the United States?\"\n\n“Psychologically important for me,\" Trump replied to Rogers. \"Now, maybe another president would feel differently, but so far I’ve been right about everything.\"",

    "fullText": "Many people bought the devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages\n\nWhat happens to the data that smart home cameras collect? Can law enforcement access this information – even when users aren’t aware officers may be viewing their footage? Two recent events have put these concerns in the spotlight.\n\nA Super Bowl ad by the doorbell-camera company Ring and the FBI’s pursuit of the kidnapper of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, have resurfaced longstanding concerns about surveillance against a backdrop of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The fear is that home cameras’ video feeds could become yet another part of the government’s mass surveillance apparatus.\n\nRing’s Super Bowl ad appeared intended to inspire hope: a neighborhood harnessing the power of technology to find a lost dog: a distraught girl misses her pet, Milo, who has gone missing. Gone are the times of putting up “missing” posters. Simply posting Milo’s photo through the Ring app automatically alerts a host of nearby cameras to use AI to look for a match, the ad says. A neighbor then arrives on their porch with Milo, safe and sound. As they reunite, feel-good music plays. But the reference to the AI-powered feature Search Party, meant to mimic the activity of a real one, quickly triggered comparisons with a dystopian Black Mirror episode. Viewers wondered: if the company could quickly access hundreds of Ring cameras in a neighborhood to find a dog, what’s stopping it from targeting a person in the same way?\n\nIn Guthrie’s case, the FBI released a video Tuesday showing a masked person at her doorstep. But the footage appears to have been retrieved from a Google Nest camera that officials previously said was disconnected and lacking an active monthly subscription for premium features. Without a subscription, users cannot typically store footage. The publication of the footage from Guthrie’s home indicated that law enforcement could still access “residual data located in backend systems”, in the words of FBI director Kash Patel; cybersecurity experts have said this may be because doorbell cameras often have back-ups stored in a cloud. It’s currently unclear whether law enforcement used a warrant.\n\n“There’s a very distinct and marked difference between what you have access to – in terms of whether you’re paying for it or not – and what the company has access to,” said Chris Gilliard, a data privacy expert who has researched how wearables and smart doorbells are contributing to mass surveillance.\n\nNew images in the search for Nancy Guthrie:\n\nOver the last eight days, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department have been working closely with our private sector partners to continue to recover any images or video footage from Nancy Guthrie’s home that may have been lost,… pic.twitter.com/z5WLgPtZpT\n\nRing, owned by Amazon, and Nest say they comply with law enforcement requests for data, including footage, when it’s legally required and in instances where there’s a threat to someone’s life. Ring also says that federal law enforcement doesn’t have direct access to the data from the doorbell camera, telling Wirecutter in a statement that “Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them”. Ring has also said that the feature advertised as being able to find dogs can’t currently detect human biometrics. Nest has said in a transparency report that the company would not instantly hand over data to a federal agency with a search warrant. “We’d analyze the request to be sure the warrant wasn’t overly broad, then we’d make sure the information they requested was within the scope of the warrant,” the company stated.\n\nThere’s been a swift backlash, as people have become more aware of surveillance concerns tied to smart home devices. Many people bought these devices thinking they would do little more than protect their delivery packages. Lawmakers from across the aisle condemned Ring’s Super Bowl ad, with the US senator Ed Markey writing in an open letter on Wednesday that “it’s not hard to imagine the ways that Amazon – or law enforcement – could abuse this feature”. TikTok influencers called on people to “smash” their Ring doorbells, and Redditors shared tips on trying to get refunds on old Ring devices from Amazon. Graphics circulating on social media stated: “Your ring camera is an ICE agent.”\n\nRing appears to be feeling the heat. On Thursday, Amazon announced that Ring had cancelled its partnership with Flock Safety, which runs a network of automated license plate readers across the US. Flock says it does not give ICE or the Department of Homeland Security direct access to its systems, but news reports have documented an ongoing loophole: cases in which local law enforcement has used Flock’s tool in aiding federal immigration authorities.\n\nRing said in a blog post that the integration with Flock would “require significantly more time and resources than anticipated”. The company also stated that no customer videos had ever been sent to Flock, since the integration never launched, stressing a commitment to making neighborhoods safer.\n\nData-privacy advocates are not convinced by Ring’s commitment to community safety, though. “Ring is just trying to protect its bottom line,” said Jeramie D Scott, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center’s surveillance oversight program. Without additional federal protections, Scott worries Ring will continue to expand its surveillance capabilities despite the recent backtracking.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Ring has faced criticism over data protection. “Ring has a history of playing it pretty loose with people’s privacy rights,” said Beryl Lipton, senior investigative researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged the company with “compromising its customers’ privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers’ private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections”. This, in turn, allowed hackers to “take control of consumers’ accounts, cameras, and videos”. Ring agreed to pay $5.8m in a settlement with the FTC.\n\nRing still has many partnerships with police, and with the return of its founder, Jamie Siminoff, who is now CEO, the company appears to be doubling down on its original emphasis on fighting crime. Siminoff said last year that his cameras can almost “zero-out crime”, though experts like Gilliard are skeptical. After Siminoff’s return, the company partnered with body-camera maker Axon to restart a tool that allows police to request footage through an online portal.\n\n“These companies – their typical strategy is to consistently push the envelope in small ways to acclimate us to more invasive uses of these things,” Gilliard said.",

    "fullText": "US presidents rode Lincoln limousines for most of the 20th century until the 1980s, when the Reagan administration switched to Cadillacs.\n\nThe latest model of the presidential limousine was commissioned by the US Secret Service in 2014 and used for the first time in 2018 by President Donald Trump.\n\nDesigned to look like a longer version of a Cadillac XT6, the chassis of the car is actually that of a Chevrolet Kodiak truck produced by General Motors, NBC News reported. The vehicle weighs around 20,000 pounds and cost around $1.5 million to build.\n\nWhile details about the limousine's security measures remain classified, NBC News reported that the vehicle features a night-vision system, tear gas firing capabilities, and door handles that can be electrified to prevent intruders.\n\nThe windows are believed to be 3 inches thick, and the vehicle's armor is around 8 inches thick.\n\nThe limousine's secure communications system can dispatch the launch codes for nuclear weapons.\n\nThe seal, featuring an eagle holding an olive branch and 13 arrows in its talons below a banner reading \"E Pluribus Unum\" (\"Out of many, one\"), appears on both the interior and exterior of the passenger door.\n\nThe interior features water bottle holders and plush leather seats. Previous presidential limousines have also included a fold-out desk, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nPresidential limousines are transported by military cargo aircraft, such as US Air Force C-17s, for use during the president's travels, according to the US Secret Service.\n\nSome presidents have used the Washington, DC, \"End Taxation Without Representation\" license plates, while others have removed the slogan.\n\nBiden and Trump rode to the 2025 inauguration ceremony together in the presidential limousine.\n\nAhead of a meeting on August 15, 2025, to discuss the war in Ukraine, Trump and Putin unexpectedly rode in the car together. The ride lasted fewer than 10 minutes and offered the leaders the opportunity to talk privately. Putin was seen smiling from within the vehicle.\n\n\"It is safe to say that this car's security and coded communications systems make it the most technologically advanced protection vehicle in the world,\" the assistant director for the US Secret Service's Office of Protective Operations said in a statement on the organization's official website.",

    "fullText": "Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton has publicly responded after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, closing a chapter that has followed him for more than two decades.\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion did not hesitate in expressing gratitude.\n\nIn a statement shared on X, Newton addressed the current US president directly.\n\n“I would like to thank President Trump and all of those that work under him who put this Pardon into effect.\n\n“Thank you, sir, for taking time out of your busy day in running this country. Thank you, sincerely, and may God bless you,” Newton tweeted.\n\nThe tone was formal and deliberate, signaling that Newton views the pardon as deeply significant.\n\nFor a player who helped anchor one of the NFL’s most dominant offensive lines in the 1990s, the message represented more than political alignment. It marked acknowledgment of a past that has long complicated his legacy.\n\nNewton’s playing career ended in the late 1990s, but his life took a darker turn in 2001 when he pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking charges.\n\nHe later served nearly two years in prison, a period that reshaped both his public image and personal trajectory.\n\nThe presidential pardon does not erase that history. It does not rewrite court records or undo the conviction.\n\nWhat it does provide is formal forgiveness at the federal level, restoring certain civil privileges and signaling that the government considers the debt paid. For Newton, that distinction matters.\n\nHis on-field achievements, including three Super Bowl rings, were never in question. What lingered was the stain of a post-career collapse that overshadowed those accomplishments.\n\nThe pardon reframes the narrative from downfall to redemption. Public reaction will inevitably vary, but Newton’s focus was clear. Gratitude, not debate. After decades defined by dominance, disgrace and now clemency, his story has taken another turn.\n\nJesse Ventura almost resigned from WWE Hall of Fame over Donald Trump induction in 2013\n\nAOC responds to Donald Trump saying he didn’t understand Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "The U.S. already has special visas for workers in sectors like agriculture and tech",
    "fullText": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to give special visas to construction workers, given that the Trump administration’s deportation campaign is reportedly causing a labor shortage on construction sites in states like Texas.\n\nThe Essential Workers for Economic Advancement Act, introduced in September, would offer non-citizens temporary, renewable visas for up to nine years to work in key industries where employers are struggling to hire.\n\n“That would help us protect and get immigrants legally for those in the construction industry,” Rep. Monica De La Cruz (R-TX) told Nexstar.\n\nDe La Cruz was part of a group of South Texas leaders who met with House Speaker Mike Johnson this week to discuss the proposal, as home builders in the state warn of slowing construction times and difficulty hiring over fears of immigration raids.\n\n“They hear Monte Cielo and say, ‘No, no. You can pay me whatever you want, but I’m not going to go work there,’” Alejandro Garcia, a home builder at work on a development in Weslaco, Texas, that has been raided multiple times, told The Wall Street Journal last week.\n\nA concrete supplier in the region, meanwhile, told the paper that concrete use fell 60 percent between May and November, as builders lost workers and projects stalled.\n\n“A project that was taking maybe four to five months on an average, starter-type home is now taking eight, nine, 10 months, just because of the delays,” Efrain Gomez, treasurer of the South Texas Builders Association, told NewsNation. “It’s a huge ripple effect.”\n\nImmigrants, legal and otherwise, make up more than half the construction workforce in states like Texas, California, Florida, and New York, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration campaign has butted up against key industries like agriculture, hospitality, and construction that rely heavily on the labor of immigrants and undocumented people.\n\nThe administration has pushed to expand the H-2A visa for farm workers, and last year, Trump toyed with a pause on raids on hotels, restaurants, and agriculture, only for the administration to insist days later there would be “no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"\n\nThe administration has faced similar tensions over the H-1B specialist visa program, which is heavily in use by the president’s allies in the tech industry but undercuts his emphasis on hiring American workers.",

    "description": "A federal judge is expected to rule in February 2026 on whether the construction can continue.",
    "fullText": "The construction of U.S. President Donald Trump’s White House ballroom was halted by a federal judge in mid-February 2026.\n\nAs of this writing, a federal judge has yet to rule on the legal status of the construction project. In a social media post, Trump stated that the project is moving \"ahead of schedule,\" while a White House spokesperson told us that the project is still in the \"demolition phase.\"\n\nA social media rumor that emerged around Feb. 10, 2026, claimed a federal judge had halted U.S. President Donald Trump's White House ballroom construction project.\n\nTrump began the demolition of the White House's East Wing in October 2025 in order to replace it with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom. In December 2025, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, arguing the project began without necessary approvals or congressional authority.\n\nIn mid-February 2026, numerous readers asked us to confirm whether a federal judge had halted construction on the ballroom. A Feb. 10 Facebook post stated:\n\nTrump's infamous new White House ballroom and bunker has been scrapped by a federal judge and the national trust preservation committee. It was also discovered the $400 million in ballroom donor money has either disappeared or simply never existed. 🤔\n\nThe image of the White House (below) shows the former site of the East Wing, built in 1902 and renovated in 1942, completely demolished with several bulldozers and skip loaders clearing the last of the rubble.\n\nGSA has to now hire a construction company to fill the east wing (trump improperly had demolished) with dirt and sod. The Judge and committee have also ruled trump \"cannot as much as paint a wall in the white house without a permit and committee approval\".\n\nAs of this writing, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, the judge overseeing the case, had yet to issue a decision on the status of the ballroom construction project. We reached out to the White House; a spokesperson told us the ballroom was not yet being constructed and the project was still in the \"demolition stage.\"\n\nWe therefore rate the claim that a judge has halted the construction as false. We will update the story when the court releases a decision.\n\nThe National Trust argued that the project proceeded without receiving authorization from Congress and with inadequate environmental assessments.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, Leon denied the National Trust's motion for a temporary restraining order on the project and temporarily allowed work to continue. The judge's order noted that because the ballroom plans had not been finalized, there was no \"imminent risk of irreparable aesthetic harm.\"\n\nAccording to arguments filed by the Trump administration in January 2026, previous presidents did not require congressional approval to carry out construction or renovations on White House grounds. The government also said above-ground construction would not begin until April 2026.\n\nIn late January 2026, Leon expressed skepticism that the administration had the legal authority to tear down the East Wing and proceed with construction. However, he said he would make a decision in the coming weeks, likely in February 2026, on whether or not to allow a preliminary injunction, which would stop the construction work for the duration of the case.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's reporting, Leon predicted the issue would also be appealed to a federal appeals court and possibly the Supreme Court. According to court records viewed on Feb. 12, Leon had not issued such an injunction.\n\nThe White House didn't specify how much money it had raised and who the private donors were, directing us to Trump's most recent statement instead. On Feb. 10, 2026, Trump posted on TruthSocial that the construction project \"is on budget, and ahead of schedule.\" He also shared digital renderings of what the potential ballroom would look like.\n\nOn Jan. 25, Trump posted that the project was privately funded and would cost $300 million to $400 million dollars:\n\nI'm building, on top of everything else that I am doing, one of the greatest and most beautiful Ballrooms anywhere in the World, with more than 300 Million Dollars of Great American Patriots' money, and working closely with, right from the beginning, the United States Military and Secret Service. This is a GIFT (ZERO taxpayer funding!) to the United States of America, of 300 to 400 Million Dollars (depending on the scope and quality of interior finishes!), for a desperately needed space [...]\n\nIn November 2025, the White House released a list of donors for the ballroom project, which included charitable organizations, sports team owners, tech companies, media companies and billionaires. The Associated Press reported an additional corporation as well as an artificial intelligence chipmaker that also donated to the project. The administration did not reveal how much each donor contributed.\n\nSnopes has covered numerous claims on the East Wing demolition and Trump's plans for a White House ballroom.\n\n\"A Crane Used in the Ballroom Construction Hovers above The White...\" Getty Images, 10 Feb. 2026, https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crane-used-in-the-ballroom-construction-hovers-above-the-news-photo/2260298495.

    "description": "President Donald Trump dropped a new riff on his election lies by telling troops that he won the popular vote in 2016 \"by a lot\".",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a new riff on his election lies by telling troops that he won the popular vote in 2016 “by a lot” — thereby inventing millions of votes he did not win.\n\nTrump has spent years falsely claiming that the 2020 election was “rigged” against him and/or “stolen” from him, despite the fact that Biden defeated Trump in an electoral landslide that has been reaffirmed over and over by state officials from Trump’s own party and dozens of court decisions.\n\nBut he won the 2016 election despite losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes.\n\nThe president departed the White House Friday afternoon en route to Fort Bragg ahead of a long weekend at his Mar-a-lago resort. In Texas, he gave a speech to military families that included many familiar touches — and one new one.\n\nDuring an introduction, Trump flatly declared that he won the popular vote “by a lot” — and without the qualifiers he has used in the past:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And he was responsible, along with Laura Trump. Laura is fantastic. Born here and loves the area, but they work together.\n\nBut Michael Watley, if he’s here, I don’t know. Michael, Michael. Michael, will you come here for a second, please? He’s running for the Senate. And if he gets in, you’re going to be taken care of.\n\nIf he doesn’t get in, we’re going to be stripping the military like they always do, the Democrats. This is a man who was the head of North Carolina. And so he did so well that I said. Who was that guy that did so well?\n\nBecause when it came time to picking the head of the Republican Party, I picked him. And you saw what happened in the last election. We won at a landslide. We won every swing state, all seven swing states.\n\nWe won by millions of votes, the popular vote.\n\nYou know, the first time I won, but they say I didn’t win the popular vote, you know I did. I won it by a lot, but they said I didn’t.\n\nSo every time they’d introduce “Donald Trump, who didn’t won the popular vote,” but he, you know, whatever.\n\nThis — I was always — I said, I don’t ever want that to happen again. But we did. We won everything.\n\nAnd this is a man that was in charge of this state. He did so well here. There was nobody else that I even considered to run the RNC. That’s the whole country.\n\nAnd we had a big, big victory just recently that you know very well — a victory like they’ve never seen. So I’d just like you to say a couple of words, Michael.

    "description": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is raging privately at allies who called out his racist video post, according to CNN White House sources.\n\nTrump posted a video to his Truth Social account last week that contained an image depicting President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes:\n\nThe post drew widespread outrage including from Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who called it “the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House.”\n\nAfter 12 hours or so, the post was deleted, with an unnamed White House official claiming “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nBut a week later, Trump is back to defending it, and according to CNN’s Alayna Treene is out for revenge against Scott and others who called him out.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, Treene told host Anderson Cooper that Trump is raging privately about Scott and Sen. Katie Britt ( for their perceived disloyalty:\n\nANDERSON COOPER: According to new reporting, there may be repercussions for some Republican lawmakers, including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who’s black. He called the Obama post, quote, the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House, seen as Alayna Treene has the story joins us now.\n\nSo Alayna, you’re reporting that the president has talked about consequences for Republicans who push back on the post. Is it clear what that means?\n\nALAYNA TREENE: Not necessarily, but we have a good idea, Anderson, from what we’ve even heard the president say this week when we saw six Republicans break with him on a different issue, on his tariffs on Canada.\n\nHe said that they would likely face primaries and would suffer consequences in the elections.\n\nBut look, from what I was told from multiple sources who were with the president or had been hearing about these comments last weekend when he was at Mar-a-Lago is he was specifically focused on two lawmakers.\n\nHe had railed against a lot of them, but Tim Scott in particular really got under his skin that he had spoken out publicly about that post.\n\nThe president telling his allies essentially that he felt Tim Scott should have reached out privately given they have a close relationship. That it was really Scott’s post calling it racist that he felt made the entire story blow up.\n\nI will say from another conversation I had with the source, they said that Tim Scott had actually privately reached out to the president first before he had posted that criticism of the post, but then didn’t reach him. And so he went ahead and published it on social media.\n\nNow, the president also had pretty strong words. I was told even stronger language for Alabama Senator Katie Britt, who had also spoken out about this.\n\nHe had used a lot of expletives, I was told, when talking about her lack of loyalty in doing that.\n\nAnd also said that she was dead to him.\n\nSo very, very much anger from the president over how some of these lawmakers had reacted.\n\nAnd I do think it reflects kind of this growing, a sense that we’re seeing of Republicans who, for the president’s first year in office, really rarely, if at all, stepped out of line to break with him. We’re seeing that happen more and \n\nWatch above via Anderson Cooper 360.\n\nThe post ‘Dead To Me!’ Trump In Profane Frothing Rage At Allies Who Slammed Racist Video Say CNN White House Sources first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two U.S. officials told Reuters, in what could become a ‌far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.\n\nThe disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due ‌to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.\n\nU.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in ​an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.\n\nU.S. officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.\n\nTrump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had \"been difficult ‌to make a deal\" with Iran.\n\n\"Sometimes you have ⁠to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained U.S. military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"President Trump has ⁠all options on the table with regard to Iran.\"\n\n\"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nThe United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when ​it ​carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHowever, June's \"Midnight Hammer\" operation was essentially a ​one-off U.S. attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United ‌States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a U.S. base in Qatar.\n\nThe planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.\n\nIn a sustained campaign, the U.S. military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.\n\nExperts say the risks to U.S. forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.\n\nThe same official said the ‌United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals ​over a period of time.\n\nThe White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about ​the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened ​to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned ‌the alternative to a diplomatic solution would \"be very traumatic, very ​traumatic.\"\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that ​in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any U.S. military base.\n\nThe U.S. maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks ​in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an ‌agreement with Iran were reached, \"it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.\"\n\nIran has said it is prepared to discuss ​curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.",

    "description": "Trump abandoned his longtime home state of New York in 2019 amid multiple civil and criminal probes into his conduct",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Friday suggested that he could make his post-presidency home near a North Carolina military base instead of the gilded Florida social club where he’s lived since leaving his longtime New York home to avoid various investigations into his conduct.\n\nTrump was winding his way through remarks to soldiers at Fort Bragg that were little different from his usual political stump speech when he began boasting about the “billions” his administration is purportedly investing into improvements to housing and other facilities on the sprawling military base.\n\nHe also claimed his administration would similarly spend “billions of dollars” on improvements “here and around the area” to “make it great” because “people in this area have been so incredible.”\n\n“In fact, I'm thinking about moving here someday. Maybe I'll, maybe I'll move here with our great movie star ... with our First Lady,” he said, referring to first lady Melania Trump, who had also traveled to the base in a rare joint appearance with her husband.\n\nTurning to his wife, he said: “We'll move to Fort. Bragg. Would you like that, darling?”\n\nThe first lady, who seemed to be there as much to promote her documentary as to ride along on to Mar-a-Lago afterward, laughed and seemed to nod, at which point Trump resumed speaking, telling the assembled soldiers: “She loves you.”\n\n“It’s a possibility — actually, it's not a bad idea, because we love it,” he said.\n\nWhile the president’s remarks were made in jest, he does have some family ties to the Tar Heel State through his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who has twice considered but rejected chances to run for open Senate seats there.\n\nTrump and his wife previously changed their primary residence in 2019, when they filed documents to officially shift their domicile from the eponymous New York skyscraper where he’d lived since 1983 to Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida mansion where he maintains quarters while using the gilded age-era residence as a social club for dues-paying members.\n\nAt the time, he claimed to “cherish” the Empire State, where he lived from birth through the start of his first term in the White House in 2018 but complained that he’d been “treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state” amid multiple civil and criminal investigations into his conduct there.\n\nThe first lady’s appearance alongside her husband — only one of a select few speaking engagements she’s had with him since his return to the White House — comes weeks after the premier of a hagiographic documentary about her preparations for his January 2025 inauguration that was purchased by Amazon for $40 million in what critics derided as a blatant payoff to her and her husband.\n\nAmazon also reportedly spent $35 million to market the film, which thus far has brought in just over $13 million in box office revenues since it was released in theaters last month.\n\nTrump referenced the documentary’s box office performance in his remarks to the troops, telling them that the United States “is truly blessed to have such a phenomenal First Lady.”\n\n“And now she’s a movie star,” he said.",

    "description": "Fox News analyst Andrew McCarthy says Justice Department's failed attempt to charge six Democratic members of Congress amounts to intolerable abuse of power.",
    "fullText": "A conservative lawyer issued a blistering takedown of President Donald Trump’s attempt to prosecute six Democratic members of Congress.\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a Fox News legal analyst and National Review editor, said an effort by the Justice Department to criminally charge the Democrats made another Trump impeachment more likely.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate.\n\n“The president will be impeached promptly if Democrats retake control of the House after the November midterms, an outcome his abuses of power have also made highly likely,” McCarthy wrote in a column published in the National Review Wednesday.\n\n“That will be the legacy of yesterday’s reported failed attempt by the Trump Justice Department to criminally charge the ‘Seditious Six,’ as the Democrats in question were labeled by Trump supporters.”\n\nMcCarthy personally characterized Trump’s attacks on the six Democrats as “intolerable” and “impeachable.” He wrote that there was “no plausible justification for the proposed indictment” against Sens. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) and Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) and Reps. Jason Crow (Colo.), Maggie Goodlander (N.H.), Chrissy Houlahan (Pa.) and Chris Deluzio (Pa.).\n\nThose Democrats were targeted by Trump last year after they posted a joint video reminding active-duty members of the military and intelligence community of their duty to refuse unlawful orders. Trump called for the Democrats to face arrest, posting on Truth Social that their message amounted to “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”\n\nOn Tuesday, federal prosecutors argued to a Washington grand jury that the Democratic lawmakers had violated a federal statute prohibiting interference with the loyalty, morale or discipline of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe grand jury declined to approve the charges sought by U.S. attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro’s office.\n\nMcCarthy wrote that the Democrats had committed “no crime at all.” He went on to condemn Trump for using the criminal justice system to target political rivals.\n\n“More even than capricious tariffs, the president’s signature policy is bullying lawfare — the tin-pot dictator-style expliitation of law-enforcement power to punish political enemies and scapegoats and to settle old scores,\" McCarthy wrote.\n\nDemocrats in Congress have also spoken out in defense of their colleagues, sounding the same alarms as McCarthy.\n\nSpeaking on the Senate floor Wednesday, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said Trump’s use of the DOJ to target lawmakers could threaten the rule of law.\n\n“The fact that they failed to incarcerate a United States senator should not obviate our outrage. They tried to incarcerate two of us,” Schatz said. “I am not entirely sure the United States Senate can survive this if we do not have Republicans standing up.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nNew poll: Trump says Greenland is ‘gonna want us,’ but do Americans want Greenland?\n\nGOP lawmaker raises eyebrows while praising Trump: ‘Whenever he leaves’\n\nJimmy Kimmel wants to rebrand the Epstein files. And Trump won’t like it.",

According to a report from ESPN, Cannon later admitted to counterfeiting in the 1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him penniless.\n\nHe served two years in a Texarkana prison.

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education emailed a group of student-loan borrowers who reached their payment threshold under income-driven repayment plans.",
    "fullText": "Some student-loan borrowers are getting an early Valentine's Day gift from the Department of Education.\n\nEarlier this week, another batch of borrowers who have completed at least 20 years of payments on an income-driven repayment plan received emails from the department with the subject line: \"You're eligible to have your student loan(s) discharged.\"\n\nThe email, which multiple borrowers shared with Business Insider, said that the department will \"work with your loan servicer to process your IDR discharge over the next several months.\" Borrowers do not need to take any action to receive the relief; however, those who wish to opt out of the relief have to contact their servicer by March 5 to specify that they do not want the discharge.\n\nBorrowers might choose to opt out of the relief to avoid state tax liability, the email said. Doing so would require them to continue paying back their loans.\n\nAfter the March opt-out date, the department will send borrowers' information to their servicers, and the servicer will notify the borrower once the relief has been processed. The email said that most borrowers will see the relief processed within two weeks, but it could take more time for some borrowers.\n\nThis student-loan forgiveness comes after the expiration of 2021 provision from the American Rescue Plan that made forgiveness tax-free. Borrowers who become eligible for relief after January 1, 2026, could be hit with thousands of dollars in taxes. However, the Department of Education previously said that it will consider the date a borrower reached their payment threshold as the date of the relief, so even if they were part of the latest batch of emails, if they completed their last payment in 2025, they should not face additional taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on how borrowers can confirm their tax status on the latest loan forgiveness. However, the borrower's servicer would typically notify the borrower of the relief's effective date.\n\nThe student-loan industry overall is facing significant changes in the coming months. Beginning in July, the department will begin implementing its repayment overhaul, which President Donald Trump signed into law as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It includes new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees. Borrowers who enroll in the new plans would have longer timelines to forgiveness and could face higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department has maintained that its goal is to simplify repayment and ensure that borrowers do not take out student loans they cannot afford to repay.\n\n\"We have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a recent statement.\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) grilled Trump administration officials in charge of immigration enforcement during a Senate hearing on Thursday. Paul confronted them with a breakdown of the video of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti’s fatal shooting, asking them if their officers acted professionally in killing a man he claimed did not show any aggression.\n\n“Today, we explore the rules of engagement, the rules for the proper use of force, and the rules for the use of force that are proportional to the threat,” Paul said. “My goal with this hearing is not to condemn or to argue to defund ICE; my goal is to restore public trust. If we don’t admit that there’s a problem, then we’re not going to get anywhere.”\n\nPaul played the video frame by frame and asked, “Is it an appropriate use of force to shove the woman to the ground here, Mr. Scott?”\n\n“I can’t answer that,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott said, “because this video doesn’t show everything that led up to it, the encounters before. That investigation is ongoing.”\n\n“So, let’s say hypothetically two women were yelling at one of your officers. Is it okay to shove them to the ground?” Paul pressed.\n\nBoth Scott and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd M. Lyons answered, “No, sir,” but didn’t answer definitively when asked if it looked like the officers attempted to de-escalate the situation.\n\n.@SenRandPaul & @SenGaryPeters break down video of Alex Pretti shooting video.\n\nSen. @RandPaul: \"It destroys the trust in ICE… I see nothing here, I mean not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part.\" pic.twitter.com/SckWt2X5wP\n\n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 12, 2026\n\n“I think what’s important about the encounter isn’t even the specifics of the investigation. It’s about, what are your officers are trained to do,” Paul said. “So, there were people who said that, ‘Yes, the officers were using de-escalation tactics.’ Nobody believes that,” Paul said. “No one in America believes that shoving that woman’s face in the snow was de-escalation.”\n\nWhen Paul got to the officers’ interaction with Pretti, he said, “At no time in the encounter do you see him try to strike an officer, nor does he brandish a weapon, which was alleged as well.”\n\n“I don’t see any resistance, but it’s kinda hard to tell when you have six people on you and you’re moving,” Paul said. “I mean, the natural instinct when you have six people on top of you is to try to move — you’re not going to be placid. But, I see nothing here, I mean not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part.”\n\n“And so, I don’t think this should take months and months and years and years — there needs to be a conclusion,” Paul said of the investigation into the officers’ conduct. “But we need to have answers here, and there needs to be an announcement, ‘These are the new policies, this is how we’re going to interact with the public.'”\n\nOn CBS Mornings, Wednesday, Paul said he believed that Lyons owed an apology to the families of Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nWatch the clip above via YouTube.\n\nThe post Rand Paul Plays Alex Pretti Killing During Senate Hearing: ‘Not Even a Hint’ of Aggression ‘On His Part’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Amid President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of the country with threats and insults, Canadian travel to the U.S. has remained at record low levels. This is despite early analyst predictions that the initial nosedive, occurring when Trump introduced 25% tariffs in February 2025, would reverse.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2026, Canadian airlines are still running 10% fewer seats on flights to the U.S. than they had in 2025, while statistics from the Canadian government show that the number of car trips from Canadians crossing the border to return home has hovered at more than a 20% decrease for months.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Canada, WestJet, Flair Airlines, and Air Transat have also responded by significantly reducing their network of flights to smaller U.S. airports.\n\nA Montréal-based carrier flying Canadians to many popular vacation destinations, Air Transat will now completely cut all U.S. service by phasing out its flights to Florida from Montréal and Québec City by June 2026, Travel Weekly reported.\n\nThe airline's flight between Montréal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL) and Orlando International (MSO) will run for the last time on May 4, and the flight from Québec City (YQB) and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) will end on May 30. The last flight between Montréal and Fort Lauderdale will run on June 13.\n\n\"This decision is part of a strategic review of our program aimed at focusing our resources on markets where we are well positioned and that allow us to optimize the deployment of our resources,\" spokesperson Marie-Eve Vallières Vallières said in a statement to Canadian outlet Travelweek. \"Florida represents a market where our exposure remains very limited and that is more fragile in the current context.\"\n\nAir Transat has not yet confirmed whether another two of its seasonal routes to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in Puerto Rico from Montréal and Toronto will return in December.\n\nAir Transat's main market still comes from resort cities such as Cancun and Punta Cana, but in the last year, it has significantly expanded its network to new destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. It is also launching new routes to more faraway countries such as Senegal, Albania, and Iceland.\n\n\"Air Transat's presence in the United States remains very marginal today, representing only 1% of our available seat‑kilometer capacity for the summer,\" Vallières said further.",

    "description": "The Trump Environmental Protection Agency delivered a significant blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules to revoke a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration delivered a deadly blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules that revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate climate pollution.\n\nFirst issued in 2009, the endangerment finding determined that six greenhouse gases could be categorized as dangerous to human health under the Clean Air Act. It has underpinned the EPA’s authority to limit planet-warming pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants and vehicles since the Obama administration and is considered the federal government’s most powerful tool to tackle climate pollution and the country’s contribution to the global crisis.\n\n“We are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding,” President Donald Trump said on Thursday, calling the policy “disastrous.”\n\nTrump said repealing the regulations “has nothing to do with public health.”\n\n“This was all a scam, a giant scam,” Trump said on Thursday. “This was a rip off of the country by Obama and Biden.”\n\nIn addition, the Trump administration will finalize a repeal of rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stem from the finding. Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA sought to tighten those standards to prod the auto industry to make more fuel-efficient hybrids and electric vehicles — an effort the industry has since backtracked on.\n\nThe full text of EPA’s repeal of the endangerment finding wasn’t made available before the Trump administration announced it, but the justification for the repeal laid out in an EPA press release relies far more on legal arguments than an outright rejection of climate science.\n\nThe agency is arguing that the Obama and Biden administrations exceeded their legal authority when they used the Clean Air Act to regulate climate pollution. This is in contrast to last summer, when the agency first proposed the repeal. The EPA proposal was then based in part on a hastily produced report authored by five climate contrarians that questioned the severity of climate impacts like wildfires, extreme heat and stronger storms.\n\nInstead of doubling down on that Thursday, the Trump EPA in a press release concluded the Clean Air Act “does not provide statutory authority for EPA” to put forward vehicle emissions standards “including for the purpose of addressing global climate change, and therefore has no legal basis for the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations.”\n\nHowever, in the same press release announcing the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin nodded to the administration’s opposition to climate policy.\n\n“Referred to by some as the ‘Holy Grail’ of the ‘climate change religion,’ the Endangerment Finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said in the EPA’s press release. While speaking next to Trump on Thursday, however, Zeldin’s remarks were slightly different.\n\n“Today, the Trump EPA has finalized the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America. Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said on Thursday.\n\nLegal precedent has granted the government regulatory powers over climate pollution. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA had the authority to regulate climate pollution from greenhouse gases. And in 2022, the US Supreme Court upheld the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, but narrowed the agency’s scope significantly, prompting the Biden administration to formulate rules aimed only at making individual power plants more efficient.\n\nThe 2022 Supreme Court ruling “never questioned that EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate at the Natural Resources Defense Fund. “That was settled law.”\n\nBut the endangerment finding repeal will thrust that question back into the courts, where litigating the repeal could take years, and potentially go all the way to the nation’s highest court. A former top Biden EPA official told CNN he believes this move shows the Trump administration is playing a legal long game.\n\n“Their definition of winning I believe has been and will be when they take final action and defend their action in the courts, to permanently remove EPA’s Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Joe Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under Biden.\n\nIf the Trump administration repeal is “upheld in court, no future EPA will be able to regulate (carbon dioxide) emissions,” said Jeff Holmstead, an energy attorney with the law firm Bracewell, and a former high-ranking EPA official in the George W. Bush administration. Congress could pass a new law that specifically directs the EPA to regulate climate pollution, but there is little bipartisan consensus on addressing the issue.\n\nZeldin laid out the agency’s argument, saying EPA has no authority to regulate certain kinds of pollution unless Congress passes a law giving them express permission.\n\n“If Congress didn’t authorize it, EPA shouldn’t be doing it,” Zeldin said on Thursday. “If Congress wants EPA to regulate the heck out of greenhouse gasses emitted from motor vehicles, then Congress can clearly make that the law.”\n\nClimate, public health and environmental groups are already promising legal challenges to the agency’s move.\n\n“Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental legal group. “The courts have repeatedly affirmed EPA’s obligation to clean up climate pollution. There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science, and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year.”\n\nOn Thursday, a coalition of public health groups including the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association announced they would sue the administration, calling the regulatory appeal “unlawful.”\n\nAttorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Fund recently emphasized that even with a conservative Supreme Court, the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been reaffirmed multiple times. NRDC attorneys suggested that EPA’s legal arguments are relatively novel, which could make the EPA’s move more vulnerable to being overturned in court.\n\n“It’s not something that has been done before,” said Hankins.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is dramatically expanding an effort to revoke U.S. citizenship for foreign-born Americans as it works to curb immigration, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nOver the past several months, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that’s responsible for legal immigration, has been sending experts to its offices around the country or reassigning staff members to focus on whether some citizens processed through those offices could now be denaturalized, these people said.\n\nThe goal of emphasizing naturalized citizens is to supply the office of immigration litigation with 100 to 200 possible cases per month, one of the people familiar with the plans said. Such cases have typically been very rare, involving people who concealed criminal histories or previous human rights violations during their application processes. The New York Times first reported the quota.\n\nThe effort is part of the overall push by Homeland Security to drastically curtail immigration and deliver on Trump’s policy agenda. The push has included DHS’ sending scores of immigration enforcement officers into U.S. cities on deportation missions and purchasing mega warehouses to hold detainees.\n\nDHS has also increasingly sought to remove legal immigrants from the U.S. by revoking thousands of visas, including for some people who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, and trying to deport green card holders.\n\nA spokesman for USCIS, Matthew Tragesser, said the agency reviews cases of naturalized citizens when there is credible evidence that citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n“We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud in the naturalization process and will pursue denaturalization proceedings for any individual who lied or misrepresented themselves,” he said. “We will continue to relentlessly pursue those undermining the integrity of America’s immigration system and work alongside the Department of Justice to ensure that only those who meet citizenship standards retain the privilege of U.S. citizenship.”\n\nTrump administration officials are looking for shortcuts to speed up the process, the two people familiar with the plans said. USCIS officials have concluded that dedicating staff members, either by sending experts or by training them across the agency’s 80-plus field offices nationwide, would be more effective in rooting out more cases than the previous Trump effort, headquartered in a warehouse in Pasadena, California, they said.\n\nThe Justice Department has already told attorneys to focus on denaturalization cases, and it has offered possible case examples, from “individuals who pose a risk to national security” or who have engaged in war crimes or torture to people who have committed Medicaid or Medicare fraud or have otherwise defrauded the government.\n\nThere is also a broad catch-all provision that refers to “any other cases ... that the division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.”\n\nOften the cases go on beyond a presidential administration. According to Justice Department figures, the Trump administration won 86 cases during Trump’s first term. During the Biden administration, 54 cases were won.\n\nTrump has long been preoccupied with the notion of citizenship — who gets to be an American and who doesn’t — and has expressed displeasure with immigrants from what he calls third world nations. He is separately seeking the power to strip citizenship from those born to foreigners in the U.S., though “birthright citizenship” appears in the Constitution. The Supreme Court is weighing his argument.\n\nTrump’s Truth Social message to Americans on Thanksgiving Day last year was that he would remove anyone who wasn’t a “net asset” to the U.S. “or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n\nRoughly 800,000 people become naturalized citizens every year, according to DHS. To become a naturalized citizen, a candidate must be over 18, already be a legal permanent resident, speak English, know U.S. history and social studies and have “good moral character,” according to the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\n\nForeign-born Americans were generally stripped of citizenship only if they were found to have committed fraud during their application processes. In past decades, those cases focused on ferreting out former Nazis who fled to the U.S. after World War II under false pretenses. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have sought to increase investigations, but it’s still rare for a reason, a former USCIS official said.\n\n“It’s so important for current and future naturalized U.S. citizens to know that no president can unilaterally strip people of the citizenship they’ve worked so hard to earn,” said Doug Rand, another former USCIS official.\n\nThe denaturalization process is lengthy and time-consuming, and there is a high legal bar. Even if the administration makes the push to investigate someone with the aim to denaturalize, it could take years, and a subsequent deportation would take even longer.\n\n“Denaturalization is a significant tool that should be used in rare cases,” said Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst who was a USCIS official under former President Joe Biden.\n\nPierce said USCIS has a lot of discretion when it decides to approve someone for naturalization, so it’s possible that someone who had no issues flagged upon becoming a citizen could face additional scrutiny now.\n\nShe said there were concerns that some of the Trump administration’s immigration policy changes could “make some naturalized citizens vulnerable to claims of fraud or misrepresentation retroactively.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers recently introduced a bill that would allow the government to strip citizenship from anyone found to have committed fraud against the government or joined a terrorist group or anyone who is convicted of a serious felony within 10 years of their citizenship.\n\nSo far in Trump’s second term, 16 cases have been filed and the administration has won seven, including one case involving a man originally from the United Kingdom who had been convicted of receiving and distributing sexually explicit images of children.\n\nDeborah Chen, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection services program, said some clients who had pending naturalization applications when the new policies went into effect were denied because they owed taxes, even though they were on payment plans.\n\nShe added that it could signal that immigration officers may be seeking more proof of “good moral character,” which they prove by showing “positive attributes,” such as family caregiving, educational attainment, stable employment and community involvement.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the DHS effort is more about creating fear and less about successfully stripping citizenship. Even if Americans swept up in investigations aren’t prosecuted or convicted, the process takes a financial and emotional toll; they’d have to hire lawyers and produce documents.\n\nMargy O’Herron, a senior fellow in the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, said the mere threat of denaturalization creates real terror.\n\n“Citizens are afraid that if they do or say something the government doesn’t like — even if those things are lawful and protected by the Constitution — they will be a target,” she said.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "The White House correspondent shared an anecdote from last May, when the White House press secretary helped her out during an overseas trip despite the administration's attacks on her back at home",
    "fullText": "Kaitlan Collins talked about an \"important\" moment between her and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt while they were in Saudi Arabia early in Trump's second term\n\nIn a new podcast interview, Collins said Leavitt stepped in after the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her for shouting a question during a public appearance\n\nThough Collins gave Leavitt \"credit\" for backing her up at the time, the White House correspondent has recently found herself at the receiving end of attacks from the Trump administration\n\nKaitlan Collins opened up about a positive moment with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt early on in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nDuring a new interview on Heather McMahan's Absolutely Not podcast, CNN's chief White House correspondent revealed that Leavitt once came to her defense during a trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCollins — who was more recently called “stupid and nasty” by Trump — recalled a moment on the May 2025 trip when she shouted a question to the president as he stood alongside other world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\"They famously do not like the media there,” Collins, 33, told McMahan. “To put it lightly.”\n\nTrump didn't answer Collins' shouted question, and after Saudi leaders left the room, Collins said the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her because she “dared to ask a question, and they’re not used to that because they don’t have a free press.\"\n\n“They came up and they said, ‘OK, well you can’t come into the next event,’ which was like two minutes later,” Collins recalled. “And I was like, ‘That’s not how this works. I go into the U.S. press,’ and they were like, ‘Well, you’re not coming in.’ ”\n\nCollins went on to explain that White House staff weren’t sure how to go about the situation, so they turned to Leavitt, 28.\n\n“To her credit, she said, ‘No, Kaitlan’s coming in with the rest of the U.S. press,’ and we went in,\" Collins said, referring to Leavitt. “And so it didn’t become this huge issue.”\n\nCollins went on to say Leavitt’s reaction was “important,” noting, “Especially when you’re kind of the U.S. contingent abroad, and we don’t do things like they do in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThough Leavitt backed Collins up when she was almost shut out by Saudi security on the international trip, the CNN reporter has faced tension with the Trump White House back at home amid the administration's attempts to erode trust in the media.\n\nTrump and Leavitt have a history of lashing out at reporters when they pose questions that the White House finds unfavorable, and Collins has been at the receiving end of hostility multiple times.\n\nAt a CNN town hall in 2023 during the GOP presidential primaries, Trump called Collins a \"nasty person\" for asking about the federal investigation into his handling of classified documents. (Weeks after the town hall, the DOJ indicted him on seven criminal counts, including violating the Espionage Act, though the case was thrown out by a Trump-appointed judge before he was tried.)\n\nIn a lengthy rant shared on Truth Social in December, Trump described Collins as “stupid and nasty” for inquiring about his controversial White House ballroom renovation — though Collins replied to his attack by saying that her question was \"technically\" about his threats toward Venezuela.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Feb. 3, Trump lashed out at Collins in person after show the White House press corps a new red-and-white baseball cap that read, “America is back.”\n\n\"Look, CNN is thrilled,” Trump said, before adding, \"She never smiles. Someday I'll see her smile,\" referring to Collins.\n\nShortly after, Collins could be heard asking the president a question while he was talking to a different reporter. “What did you say? Go ahead, CNN,\" Trump said.\n\n“What would you say to the survivors…” Collins, asked, referring to the survivors of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN... CNN has no ratings because of people like you. You know she’s a young woman,” Trump interjected, referring to Collins. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face.”\n\n“Well I’m asking you about survivors,” Collins replied.\n\n“You know why you’re not smiling? Because you know you’re not telling the truth,\" Trump added. \"You’re a very dishonest organization and they should be ashamed of you.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring 20 inmates with commuted death sentences to the nation’s highest security federal prison, warning that officials cannot employ a “sham” process for deciding where to incarcerate the prisoners for the rest of their lives.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled late Wednesday that the government cannot send the former death row inmates to the “Supermax” federal prison in Florence, Colorado, because it likely would violate their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.\n\nKelly cited evidence that officials from the Republican administration “made it clear” to the federal Bureau of Prisons that the inmates had to be sent to ADX Florence — “administrative maximum\" — to punish them because Democratic President Joe Biden had commuted their death sentences.\n\n“At least for now, they will remain serving life sentences for their heinous crimes where they are currently imprisoned,” wrote Kelly, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn December 2024, less than a month before Trump returned to the White House, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump issued an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to house the 37 inmates “in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.”\n\nTwenty of the 37 inmates are plaintiffs in the lawsuit before Kelly, who issued a preliminary injunction blocking their transfers to Florence while the lawsuit proceeds. All were incarcerated in Terre Haute, Indiana, when Biden commuted their death sentences.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that the bureau has broad authority to decide what facilities the inmates should be redesignated for after their commutations.\n\n“BOP’s designation decisions are within its exclusive purview and are intended to preserve the safety of inmates, employees, and surrounding communities,” they wrote.\n\nThe judge concluded that the inmates have not had a meaningful opportunity to challenge their redesignations because it appears the outcome of the review process was predetermined.\n\n\"But the Constitution requires that whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of a liberty or property interest that the Due Process Clause protects — whether that person is a notorious prisoner or a law-abiding citizen — the process it provides cannot be a sham,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nThe Florence prison has housed some of the most notorious criminals in federal custody, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The prison is “unmatched in its draconian conditions,” the inmates' attorneys argued.\n\n“The categorical redesignations challenged here deprived Plaintiffs of an opportunity to show why they should not be condemned to a life bereft of human contact, in a cell the size of a parking spot, where they will see nothing out the window but a strip of sky,” they wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys said other courts have held that the conditions are not objectively cruel and unusual.\n\n“Plaintiffs fail to show that conditions at ADX are atypical for them,” they wrote.",

Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

    "fullText": "The president appeared to experience a system malfunction during a self-indulgent speech at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nDonald Trump, 79, drew attention to his declining health with a confounding word salad at an event celebrating him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”\n\n“I’m proud to officially name the undispuut...” Trump said, before muttering unintelligible gibberish for about two seconds.\n\n“When did this come out? Mr. Speaker,” he said, before appearing to remember his lines and getting back on track. “The undisputed champion of beautiful, clean coal.”\n\n“We have to proceed, always—don’t use the word coal, you know, it needs a PR job,\" he added.\n\nThe strange slip-up generated buzz almost immediately on social media, with internet users, including Trump’s former opponent Kamala Harris, commenting on the president’s supposedly diminishing mental faculties.\n\n“Trump, slurring: I’m proud to officially name the...undishpu...the...jshhhh...whendidthiscomeout,” wrote the Headquarters account, which is operated by Harris’ team.\n\nTrump’s trolling rival, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, couldn’t miss an opportunity to slam the president, with his press office posting the footage on X. “The sundowning starts earlier every day,” the caption read.\n\nWhen contacted by the Daily Beast for comment, White House Spokesman Davis Ingle said, “President Trump is the sharpest, most accessible, and energetic president in American history. While the deranged and failing Daily Beast has their lightweight, glue-sniffing interns push baseless conspiracy theories — President Trump spent the day unleashing energy dominance, lowering costs, and putting the American people first.”\n\nAlso, during the appearance, as the president was speaking about the benefits of coal-based energy, he took a tangent to one of his favorite topics: windmills.\n\n“I’m not a big fan of those crazy windmills,” Trump said, mimicking a windmill’s circular motion with his finger. “They’re made in China but not used by China. Let’s look for a couple of wind farms in China. See if you can find one.”\n\nChina is the undisputed leader in wind and solar power, according to The Guardian, with nearly twice as much renewable energy under construction as the rest of the world combined.\n\nHe called the inanimate objects “losers” before saying, “You’re supposed to make money with energy, not lose money with energy.”\n\nAside from his speech slip-ups, the president’s right hand also appeared discolored again, as the Daily Beast has reported extensively.\n\nTrump’s health has been in decline for months, from cankle appearances to awkward descents down the stairs of Air Force One; the president is now repeatedly finding himself having to defend his multiple gaffes.\n\nFollowing his speech, the president was presented with a trophy of a golden miner by the Washington Coal Club, which designated him as the “Undisputed Champion of Coal.”",

    "description": "President Donald Trump met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he'd insisted that negotiations with Iran continue as the U.S. pushes for a nuclear deal with ...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump met privately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he'd insisted that negotiations with Iran continue as the U.S. pushes for a nuclear deal with Tehran.\n\nNetanyahu spent nearly three hours at the White House, but he entered and left out of the view of reporters and he and Trump didn't take questions. In a subsequent post on his social media site, however, the president called it “a very good meeting” and said “there was nothing definitive reached, other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated.”\n\n“If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference,” Trump wrote. “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”\n\nHe added, “Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal” and were hit by U.S. airstrikes.\n\n“Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible,” Trump wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Netanyahu's office said the two leaders had discussed negotiations with Iran as well as developments in Gaza and around the region and they had “agreed to continue their close coordination and relationship.”\n\nWednesday's meeting was their seventh during Trump’s second term and took place as both the U.S. and Iran are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how, once again, to approach negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nTrump said on reaching an agreement with Iran in a Tuesday interview with Fox Business Network’s Larry Kudlow: “I think they’d be foolish if they didn’t. We took out their nuclear power last time, and we’ll have to see if we take out more this time.”\n\n“It’s got to be a good deal,” he said then. “No nuclear weapons, no missiles.”\n\nNetanyahu's office said prior to the meeting that he wants the U.S.-Iran talks to include limits on Tehran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\n“I will present to the president our outlook regarding the principles of these negotiations — the essential principles which, in my opinion, are important not only to Israel, but to everyone around the world who wants peace and security in the Middle East,” Netanyahu said Tuesday before leaving Israel.\n\nBut it remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump's approach toward Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests in January, then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program.\n\nIran is still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel in June. The devastating series of airstrikes, including the U.S. bombing several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that U.S. strikes had “obliterated” Iran's nuclear capabilities, though the amount of damage remains unclear. Satellite photos of nuclear sites have recently captured activity, prompting concern that Iran could be attempting to salvage or assess damage at the sites.\n\nIsrael has long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile program and cut ties to militant groups across the region. Iran has always rejected those demands, saying it would only accept some limits on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.\n\nWashington has built up military forces in the region, sending an aircraft carrier, guided-missile destroyers, air defense assets and more to supplement its presence. Arab and Islamic countries, including Turkey and Qatar, have been urging both sides to show restraint, warning that any strike or retaliation could have destabilizing consequences for a region already strained by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nIn his post, Trump said he and Netanyahu had “also discussed the tremendous progress being made in Gaza, and the Region in general.”\n\nTrump plans to hold the first meeting next week of his Board of Peace, which was initially framed to oversee future steps of the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan but has taken shape with Trump's ambitions of resolving other global crises.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House, across the street from the White House, and agreed to be part of the board.\n\nOn Iran, Trump said Friday that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and son-in-law Jared Kushner had “very good” talks and more were planned this week. But the Republican president kept up the pressure, warning that if Iran did not make a deal over its nuclear program, “the consequences are very steep.”\n\nIran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, made similar comments, saying there will be consultations on “next steps.” He also said the level of mistrust between the two longtime adversaries remains a “serious challenge facing the negotiations.”\n\nHe signaled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium — a major point of contention with Trump.\n\nNetanyahu met with Witkoff and Kushner shortly after arriving in Washington on Tuesday evening and they gave him an update on the talks held with Iran in Oman, the prime minister's office said.\n\nAraghchi said in November that Iran was no longer enriching uranium due to the damage from last year’s war.\n\nBefore the war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that was not armed with the bomb.\n\nIran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war. Even before that, Iran has restricted IAEA inspections since Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nAmiri reported from New York, Weissert from Washington.",

    "fullText": "One year into Donald Trump's presidency, bitcoin is worth less than it was before he was elected, and the entire market is in the throes of a crypto winter. According to famed investor Ross Gerber, blame the meme coin ecosystem for the broader decline.\n\nThe CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management thinks the launch of the Trump and Melania coins around the time of the inauguration, followed by a subsequent boom in meme tokens, has left investors fatigued and wary of digital assets.\n\nIn his view, meme coins either endorsed or launched by celebrities are either rug pulls or end up looking like one. In either case, normal investors are left holding the bag while celebrity boosters get rich.\n\nHe pointed to World Liberty Financial Coin and the Melania token, which have both plummeted in price, while the Trump meme coin has also shed about 80% of its value in the last year.\n\n\"People dive in and buy this stuff because they buy into the fraud, basically, and then they get burned, and that money doesn't come back. It's stolen from them.\"\n\nThis is only part of the problem that Gerber sees. When people lose money betting on meme coins, he added, they typically turn their back on crypto and don't come back. He also thinks the Trump administration's looser approach to crypto regulation is making the market less appealing to everyday investors.\n\nHe said it is extremely difficult for bitcoin to rally when investors are being scared away from crypto, as demand rises only when new participants enter the market.\n\nGerber also cited other celebrity-launched cryptos, such as the token launched by former NYC mayor Eric Adams and the $HAWK coin launched by internet personality Haliey Welch, as examples of celebrities meme coins that plummeted shortly after they debuted, while leaving investors holding the bag.\n\nGerber isn't the only one arguing that a growing lack of faith in crypto is compromising bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Economist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently argued that it will be hard for bitcoin to rise again until institutional investors increase their participation.",

    "fullText": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday expressed concern that China was costing Peru its sovereignty in solidifying control over the South American nation's critical infrastructure, a blunt warning after a Peruvian court ruling restricted a local regulator's oversight of a Chinese-built mega port.\n\nThe $1.3 billion deepwater port in Chancay, north of Peru's capital of Lima, has become a symbol of China's foothold in Latin America and a lightning rod for tensions with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was “concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"\n\nIt added: “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty.”\n\nThe concern comes as the Trump administration seeks to assert dominance over the Western Hemisphere, where China has long built influence through massive loans and high trade volumes.\n\nThe Chinese government on Thursday strongly rejected the U.S. comments.\n\n“China firmly opposes and strongly deplores the U.S.’s blatant rumor-mongering and smearing of Chancay port,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nChancay, along the Pacific coast, is part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an infrastructure program that has seen Chinese state-owned banks offer sizable loans or financial guarantees to construct seaports, airports and highways, among other projects, across multiple continents.\n\nAs Latin America's deepest port, Chancay is capable of berthing some of the world’s largest cargo ships traveling between Asia and South America. China has been Peru’s biggest trading partner for more than a decade now.\n\nChina’s state-owned shipping and logistics company Cosco, a majority shareholder in the port, dismissed the U.S. claims.\n\nIn response to questions from The Associated Press, it said the court ruling “in no way involves aspects of sovereignty\" and insisted that the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities, subject to all Peruvian regulations.”\n\nIt added there were plenty of Peruvian authorities monitoring the port's activities, including police forces, environmental regulators and customs officials.\n\nThe ruling issued Jan. 29 by a lower court judge orders Peruvian authorities to refrain from exercising “powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction” over the port in Chancay.\n\nThe regulator, Ositran, which has oversight over all of the country's other major ports, said it would appeal the decision, arguing that there was no reason to exempt Cosco Shipping from the agency's oversight.\n\n“(Cosco Shipping) would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised,\" Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, told a local radio station Wednesday.\n\nAlthough it's privately owned, the Chancay Port covers 180 hectares (about 445 acres) of Peruvian territory, Zambrano added, making it subject to government efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with local user protection standards.",

Attorney General Pam Bondi testified for hours on Wednesday.

Fox viewers saw almost none of it, as in total, the Trump-friendly channel aired less than 10 minutes of her nearly 5-hour testimony.

    "description": "President Trump says nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.",
    "fullText": "President Trump said Wednesday that nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.\n\nThe White House was initially going to exclude Democratic governors from a formal, typically bipartisan business meeting on Feb. 20 during the annual National Governors Association (NGA) conference, according to the NGA and a source familiar with the White House's planning.\n\nAnd two Democratic governors, Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado, said they were informed by the NGA last Friday they would not be invited to a separate dinner at the White House on Feb. 21 with the president, the governors and their spouses.\n\nBut after talks between the White House and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, the organization and the president said Wednesday that governors from both parties are welcome to both the meeting and the dinner. Democratic governors began receiving invitations on Wednesday evening to the business meeting, though the NGA did not receive updates about the White House dinner.\n\nGov. Stitt informed governors of all 55 states and territories on Wednesday that all are invited to the formal meeting on Feb. 20.\n\n\"He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association's event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling,\" Stitt wrote in a message to governors obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon Truth Social post after Stitt's message was sent, Mr. Trump wrote that Moore and Polis are still excluded. He suggested there was a misunderstanding between him and Stitt.\n\n\"The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,\" Trump wrote, adding that he \"even invited\" two of his political foes, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"So, as usual with him, Stitt got it WRONG! The Invitations were sent out to all other Governors, Democrat and Republican.\"\n\nMoore still received an invite on Wednesday to the formal meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt is unclear if Polis received an invitation to that meeting as well. A spokesperson for the Colorado governor said \"no matter what events Colorado is or isn't invited to, Governor Polis will continue to focus on working with his fellow governors and anyone who wants to help make people's lives better.\" CBS News has reached out to the White House.\n\nThe NGA said it was informed by the White House on Feb. 5 that only Republican governors would be invited to the formal business meeting. Because of these exclusions, the NGA said the following day that it would not facilitate that meeting or put it on the group's official schedule. Stitt reiterated that in a letter to governors on Monday, and defended Moore as \"an exceptional vice chair\" for the NGA.\n\nAfter reports of Democratic governors being excluded from the meeting, nearly every Democratic governor put out a joint statement Tuesday that indicated they wouldn't attend any White House events, including the dinner, out of solidarity with Moore and Polis.\n\nIn his Wednesday post, Mr. Trump cited a disagreement over the imprisonment of former Colorado county election clerk Tina Peters as the reason for not inviting Polis. The president has pushed Polis for months to grant clemency to Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence on multiple state charges related to unauthorized access to voting machines.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump called Moore \"foul mouthed\" and claimed he had embellished receiving military medals, though Moore has said it was an \"honest mistake\" on a White House fellowship application in 2006. He has since received a Bronze Star for his deployment to Afghanistan.\n\nThe president also criticized Stitt, calling him a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only. Stitt had backed Mr. Trump's former opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, during the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nMoore called the decision not to invite him \"another example of blatant disrespect and a snub to the spirit of bipartisan federal-state partnership\" in a statement earlier this week.\n\nA Polis spokesperson called it a \"disappointing decision for a traditionally bipartisan event between Governors and whomever occupies the White House.\"\n\nGovernors from both parties attended a White House meeting and dinner during last year's conference. The meeting drew attention for a verbal scuffle between Mr. Trump and Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in which the president pressed Mills on the issue of transgender women in sports, and Mills responded: \"We'll see you in court.\"\n\nDetails on new images of subject in Nancy Guthrie disappearance\n\nWatch: Rep.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former federal prosecutor who quit amid a dispute with the Trump administration is now representing former CNN host Don Lemon, who was one of nine people indicted for their alleged roles in disrupting a service at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was a pastor.\n\nA court filing Tuesday shows that Lemon has hired former interim U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of major fraud cases for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office until he resigned last month.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have now left the office at a time of growing frustration with the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two people by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLemon had previously said through another attorney that he planned to plead not guilty to federal civil rights charges over his coverage of the church protest. He has said he was not affiliated with the group that disrupted the church service, and that he was there in his capacity as an independent journalist. The indictment alleges various actions by the group that entered the church, including what Lemon said as he reported on the event for his livestream show.\n\nLemon is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 13 in federal court in St. Paul.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the Minnesota fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown in the state. Thompson estimated in December that the losses to taxpayers from several fraud cases being prosecuted in Minnesota could total $9 billion.\n\nThompson recently formed his own law firm with Harry Jacobs, another former federal prosecutor who resigned amid the upheaval in the office. Jacobs had been lead prosecutor in the case of Vance Boelter, who has pleaded not guilty in last year's assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the nonfatal shootings of a state senator and his wife.\n\nThe firm's website describes them as “battle tested and seasoned” trial lawyers.\n\nThompson did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of its annual meeting next week.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump blasted Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, as a “RINO,” meaning Republican in Name Only. Trump said Stitt “incorrectly stated my position on the very exclusive Governors Annual Dinner and Meeting at the White House.”\n\nThe dispute centers on whether Trump would allow governors from both major parties to participate in the full range of White House events, which typically includes a business meeting and meal. In a letter to fellow governors on Monday, Stitt said the NGA was informed that the White House planned to limit invitations to the business meeting to Republicans. That prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said they wouldn't participate in the meal if they weren’t fully included at the business meeting.\n\n“I am writing to inform you that President Donald J. Trump is inviting all governors of the 55 States and territories to the Friday, Feb. 20 NGA Business Breakfast at 8:30am est.,” Stitt wrote. “He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association’s event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Donald Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling.”\n\nTrump, however, struck a far more adversarial tone in his social media post, calling Stitt's Monday letter “false.”\n\n“The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,” he wrote, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado.\n\nTrump added: “I look forward to seeing the Republican Governors, and some of the Democrats Governors who were worthy of being invited, but most of whom won’t show up.”\n\nFollowing Trump's post, Brandon Tatum, the NGA's chief executive, stood by the group's timeline of events.\n\n“As of Tuesday evening, only Republican Governors received invites from the White House for the Friday morning business meeting,” he said in a statement. “We are hopeful that we can have constructive bipartisan dialogue with the President during the session. Continuing the tradition of the business meeting is an important step toward bridge building among parties.”\n\nFor now, it's unclear how many Democrats will show up at the White House. Some, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said Wednesday they didn't plan to attend the meeting. Others, such as Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, signaled they would participate.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump has “discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.”\n\nThe spat is a reminder of the challenge facing bipartisan or nonpartisan organizations in Trump's Washington. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes city leaders from both parties, met in Washington earlier this month but wasn't invited to the White House.\n\nThe governor's meeting, typically a low-key event, took a sharper edge last year when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe president singled out Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, over his administration's effort to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. He threatened to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply, prompting Mills to retort, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order, though she is now running for U.S. Senate on a staunch anti-Trump agenda.\n\nThe back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.",

    "description": "Russian authorities said two major airlines were flying one-way flights out of Cuba, as the Trump administration pressures the island's oil supply.",
    "fullText": "Moscow's civil aviation authority said on Wednesday that two major Russian airlines are helping to repatriate its citizens from Cuba amid a jet fuel shortage on the island.\n\nThe agency, Rosaviatsia, said that Rossiya Airlines had changed its flight schedule \"to ensure the evacuation of Russian tourists currently in Cuba.\"\n\nRossiya, which is owned by Russian aviation giant Aeroflot, and Nordwind Airlines, a Russian luxury airline, announced on the same day that they would suspend flights to Cuba and offer only one-way tickets out of the island.\n\nAll parties cited \"difficulties with refueling aircraft in Cuba.\"\n\n\"Starting February 12, a number of one-way return flights will be operated from Havana and Varadero to Moscow to accommodate Russian tourists currently in Cuba,\" wrote Rossiya Airlines.\n\nNordwind Airlines, a Russian leisure airline, said it would fly only repatriation flights from the resort locations of Varadero, Holguin, and Cayo Coco.\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry estimated last week that at least 4,000 Russian tourists are in Cuba.\n\nThe announcements came after Cuban aviation authorities warned on Monday that the island would not have jet fuel available at international airports for a month.\n\nCuba heavily depends on Venezuela for oil, but has stopped receiving imports since January 3, when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces.\n\nMexico ranks in distant second place as an oil supplier to Cuba, but it also halted exports to the island after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries that send oil to Havana.\n\nCanadian airlines, which run some of the highest-traffic routes to Cuba, said they were canceling flights to the island from Monday onward. Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

    "description": "A bipartisan coalition in the House delivered a rare rebuke of Trump's tariffs by voting against his duties on Canada, citing economic concerns.",
    "fullText": "The US and Canada relationship has been tense since President Donald Trump took office a second time and began levvying tariffs on the neighbor to the north and throwing around the term \"51st state.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Congress delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's tariffs on Canada — even as the president escalated the spat this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada by passing a resolution introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York that would rescind the tariffs Trump imposed on the neighbor under a national emergency declaration.\n\nAs tensions with the US's closest trading partner continue to escalate, the measure cleared the chamber 219 to 211, with six Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump and GOP leadership. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it.\n\nThe vote came a day after Republican leaders failed to block the effort through a procedural maneuver, when three GOP lawmakers sided with Democrats to allow debate to move forward. Trump publicly warned Republicans not to cross him and threatened political retaliation against anyone who voted against tariffs.\n\n\"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social ahead of the vote.\n\nBoth Republicans who defected and Democrats cite economic impacts as their primary reason for opposing tariffs.\n\n\"Today's vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump?\" said Meeks, who authored the resolution, ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that \"sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people\" and that Trump's tariffs were \"causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families\".\n\n\"As an old fashioned Conservative I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers,\" said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who voted against tariffs on Canada alongside the Democrats. Bacon will be retiring and won't seek reelection in the midterm.\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate. But even if it passes, Trump is expected to veto it, making the effort largely symbolic.\n\nThe congressional rebellion comes as Trump's dispute with Canada intensifies. In January, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade agreement with China, which offered China a quota for EV exports in exchange for certain agricultural tariffs on Canada being dropped. Trump then threatened to block the opening of a new bridge between Michigan and Ontario, and demanded some ownership of the bridge that Canada paid for.\n\nThough a conversation between Carney and Trump has de-escalated threats on the bridge, it is clear that sentiment toward the US in Canada has soured.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Canadians returning to Canada after traveling in the US took a dive in early 2025 and are down about a quarter from the year before as of November 2025. After Canadian provinces launched a boycott against American alcohol products, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025 and fell below $10 million in export value, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against a House GOP-drafted bill to require people to show documented proof of citizenship before registering to vote and to show ID to cast a ballot, a top priority of the Trump administration.\n\nMurkowski, a prominent centrist Republican, said the Constitution empowers states to manage federal elections for Senate and the House seats, and warned that imposing sweeping federal requirements on local election officials a few months before Election Day would threaten the integrity of the midterm elections.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed. Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that,” Murkowski wrote in a statement posted to social media.\n\n“Once again, I do not support these efforts,” she announced.\n\nShe said the Constitution “clearly” provides states with the authority to regulate the time, place and manner of holding federal elections.\n\nShe argued that “one-size-fits-all” mandates from Washington seldom work in her home state.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said.\n\n“Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this,” Murkowski added.\n\nThe House is expected to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — or the SAVE America Act — on Wednesday. It has passed a similar version of the legislation, previously known as the SAVE Act, multiple times in the past few years.\n\nMurkowski’s statement comes as Senate conservatives led by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) are pressing Senate GOP leaders to reinterpret the Senate’s filibuster rule to make it easier to pass the law.\n\nLee made a presentation to the Senate GOP conference Tuesday afternoon arguing that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) should require Democrats actively hold the floor with round-the-clock speeches if they want to block the elections bill.\n\nThune, however, is leery of deploying that strategy, because it could tie up the Senate floor for weeks.\n\nAnd Democrats, if they regain control of Congress and the White House, could also require Republicans to engage in continuous floor debate to block Democratic legislative priorities.\n\nThe SAVE America Act would also require states to conduct reviews of voting rolls to purge inactive voters, something critics say would prevent some infrequent voters from participating due to possibly faulty data.\n\nSenate Democrats have lambasted the SAVE America Act as legislation that would make it tougher for minority and low-income voters to participate in elections.\n\n“Let’s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters. The SAVE Act seeks to disenfranchise millions of American citizens, seize control of our elections, and fan the flames of election skepticism and denialism,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, vowing Democrats will block the legislation.",

    "fullText": "The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.\n\nThe official told Business Insider that \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,\" adding that the Pentagon \"took action to disable the drones.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon \"have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,\" the official added.\n\nIt's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.\n\nA social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption \"defend the homeland,\" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.\n\nFort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.\n\nCartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon \"acted swiftly\" to address what he described as a \"cartel drone incursion.\"\n\nThe FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to \"special security reasons.\" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.\n\nThe restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US \"may use deadly force\" if an aircraft became \"an imminent security threat.\" It did not offer more details about the situation.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision \"unprecedented.\"\n\nHowever, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that \"all flights will resume as normal.\" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.\n\nIn recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.\n\nThese concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.",

    "description": "James...",
    "fullText": "The refusal of those who have held power over Palestine to acknowledge the grievances and aspirations of its indigenous Arab people isn’t new.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump convened his so-called Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland, a key item on the agenda was to endorse his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s extravagant (and, I might add, detached from reality) plan for a “New Gaza.” The rendering of Kushner’s scheme shows it to be more of a luxury resort for wealthy tourists than the foundation of a just future for the Palestinian victims of Israel’s genocide. But since the raison d’être of the Board of Peace was supposed to be dealing with the aftermath of Israel’s war on Gaza, the conversation, by necessity, had to address the needs of hundreds of thousands of now-homeless Palestinians.\n\nThus, Kushner presented a proposal for a model Palestinian community—the “New Rafah”—he intends to build to house Palestinians in Gaza. The plans for this New Rafah have been circulated since the meeting. Everything is covered: how Gaza’s economy will run, how its educational and health systems will create a new generation of hale and non-ideological Palestinians, and how the “new cities” will be laid out, function, and be governed. And everything has been calculated down to how many teachers, doctors, judges, religious leaders, and laborers will be needed per capita in each community.\n\nIf Kushner were preparing an owner’s manual for a complex piece of machinery or the instructions for installing and operating new software, this plan might seem flawless. But Palestine isn’t a video game, and Palestinians are human beings, not Lego pieces to be assembled, as per the instructions. Like every other people on earth, Palestinians have emotional ties to their homes and families, and memories of the personal and collective injustices they have endured. This failure to consider the fullness of Palestinian humanity is the fatal flaw that will either stop the New Rafah before it begins or cause it to unravel soon afterward.\n\nThe refusal of those who have held power over Palestine to acknowledge the grievances and aspirations of its indigenous Arab people isn’t new. In fact, it has defined their history.\n\nFor example, in 1919, when the British Lord Balfour was presented with the findings of the US-commissioned survey of Arab attitudes, which demonstrated their overwhelming rejection of his intent to grant the Zionist movement a homeland in Palestine, he famously responded, “In Palestine, we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting its inhabitants as to their wishes.… Zionism…[is] of far profounder import than the desire and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who inhabit that ancient land.”\n\nAnd Palestinians were not consulted when the UN drew up grossly unfair maps to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Those maps gave the Jewish community over one-half of the land (despite its being less than a third of the population). The maps were rejected by Palestinians because more than half a million of them were disenfranchised without any say in the matter. Nor did Palestinians receive support when 650,000 of their brethren were expelled from the newly created Israel in 1948, or when, after the Oslo Accords, neither the UN nor the US would hold Israel accountable for sabotaging the peace plan through settlement expansion, land seizures, the erection of a wall, and the deliberate obstruction of the development of a Palestinian economy.\n\nInstead of acting to support Palestinians as their rights were systematically trampled, the US and other Western states have historically blamed Palestinians, while exonerating themselves and Israel. The result of this century of systematic abuse and denial of rights has been to create a Palestinian community that is justifiably embittered and losing hope. And when they express these feelings, their grievances are dismissed and they are told to just “deal with it”—something that would never be said to, for example, Israelis or the Jewish people.\n\nThis is because US policymakers understand the full humanity of the Jewish community. They understand their history of the losses they have experienced and their need to be respected and heard.\n\nWhat we are seeing in the wake of the genocide in Gaza and in the midst of the state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing and erasure of Palestinian communities in the West Bank is just the same story playing out one more time. Every effort is made to make Israelis feel secure, while Palestinians are expected to lose their homes, families, and memories, and be resigned to being moved about like pawns on a chessboard and be grateful to have the opportunity to live in a model city once they have been properly vetted, biometrically identified, and de-radicalized.\n\nThe bottom line is that Palestinians have never been permitted the human right to make their own decisions. The results have been devastating for both them and the region. The reason behind the wars that have been fought and the aberrant behavior of some elements of Palestinian society can be found in one simple fact: the refusal to allow Palestinians the freedom to determine their future in a manner that recognizes the fullness of their humanity.\n\nWe’ve polled throughout Palestine a number of times in the past few years, and what we’ve found is that Palestinians don’t want to live under the control of Israel or any other external powers. They want the Israeli occupation to end, national unity of all factions in all parts of their country, and to hold a national referendum to elect new leaders and develop a plan for governance that can move them toward freedom and independence. They deserve nothing less.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that allows the federal government to revoke American passports until payments are made, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nWhile passport revocations for unpaid child support of more than $2,500 have been permitted under 1996 federal legislation, the State Department had in the past acted only when someone applied to renew their travel document or sought other consular services. In other words, enforcement depended on the person approaching the department for assistance.\n\nStarting soon, however, the department will begin to revoke passports on its own initiative based on data shared with it by the Health and Human Services Department, according to the U.S. officials familiar with the plan. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the change has not yet been publicly announced.\n\nThe number of people who could be affected was not immediately clear, but it is believed to be in the thousands. Because of the potentially large universe of those owing child support who currently hold passports, the State Department will make the change in tiers, the officials said.\n\nThe first group to be affected will be passport holders who owe more than $100,000 in past-due child support, the officials said. One of the officials said fewer than 500 people meet that threshold and could avoid having their passport revoked if they enter into a payment plan with HHS after being notified of the pending revocation.\n\nThe official acknowledged, though, that if and when the threshold is lowered to a smaller past-due amount, the number of those affected will rise significantly. The official could not say when any further changes would take effect or estimate how many people might then lose their passports.\n\nIn an emailed response to the AP's queries about the change, the State Department said it \"is reviewing options to enforce long-standing law to prevent those owing substantial amounts of child support from neglecting their legal and moral obligations to their children.” It added: “It is simple: deadbeat parents need to pay their child support arrears.”\n\nSince the Passport Denial Program began with the 1996 passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the initiative has taken in nearly $621 million in past-due child support payments, with nine collections of more than $300,000, according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS did not respond to questions about how many people are in arrears.",

    "description": "Trade tensions between the US and Canada escalate as Donald Trump threatens to delay the Gordie Howe International Bridge, challenging Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is singing \"No Canada\" as a sprawling bridge connecting Ontario to Detroit nears completion.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is set to connect Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Construction began in 2018, with an anticipated opening planned for 2024. Delays pushed the opening to 2026 — and Trump's threats could delay it even longer.\n\nThe US and Canada are engaged in an ongoing trade spat that includes liquor sales, travel, and electric vehicles. On Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wouldn't allow the bridge to open until Canada compensated the United States \"for everything we have given them.\"\n\nNegotiations would start immediately, Trump wrote. The bridge now remains in a state of limbo. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThere's already one bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened in 1929. It's been privately owned by the Moroun family for decades. It reportedly carries about $360 million a day, or about 25% of the value of goods traveling between the US and Canada. It's also limited in its scale, with only four lanes, limited shoulders, and constricted traffic patterns leading up to it in Windsor.\n\nIn 2012, both Canada and Michigan approved the construction of a second bridge, the Gordie Howe. They officially broke ground in October 2018 on the 1.5-mile, six-lane bridge, which will also include a walking and biking path.\n\nThe bridge cost an estimated CA$6.4 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Canada paid for the entire project and plans to recoup its investment through toll revenues.\n\nMichigan will also own a part of the bridge, and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority will manage operations.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that the bridge would not open until Canada treated the US with the \"Fairness and Respect that we deserve.\"\n\nThe feud between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reached a fever pitch. At Davos, the two world leaders exchanged fiery speeches. Canada recently reached a \"preliminary agreement\" for a trade deal with China, and Trump responded with the threat of 100% tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China would allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter the Canadian market at the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In exchange, Carney expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian agricultural tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China was a point of contention in Trump's post about the bridge. He wrote that China would \"eat Canada alive,\" and said the country would ban hockey and eliminate the Stanley Cup.\n\nTrump wrote that the US \"should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset.\" (Michigan and Canada already jointly own the bridge.)\n\nThere's also the Moroun family, which owns the existing Ambassador Bridge. They've publicly lobbied Trump to stop the new bridge, going so far as to air a commercial in 2018. And on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Matthew Moroun met with Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, about the project. Hours after that reported meeting, Trump posted about the bridge on Truth Social.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. During Trump's first presidency, he issued a statement with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in support of the project.\n\n\"We look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries,\" the two leaders wrote.\n\nCarney said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday morning about the bridge, explaining that Canadians had paid in full for the project and that Michigan already had an ownership stake.\n\nOne of Trump's critiques was that the bridge was not built using American products. Carney said he told Trump the bridge was built with American and Canadian workers and steel from both the US and Canada.\n\n\"It was a positive conversation,\" Carney said.\n\nMichigan, the second party in the agreement with Canada, doesn't seem thrilled, either. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that she was in communication with Trump's staff, and that the bridge was a \"really important part of our economy.\"\n\nAnd they may not wait for Trump's approval. Whitmer's press secretary said on Tuesday that the bridge would open \"one way or another.\"",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson failed to reinstate a ban on lawmakers’ ability to challenge President Donald Trump’s tariffs when three Republicans crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe House sank a procedural vote on Tuesday that contained language blocking votes in the chamber that object to Trump’s tariffs through July. The move opens the door for Democrats to move forward with forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs, in a blow to the administration.\n\nWith razor-thin margins in the House, three Republicans – GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Don Bacon and Kevin Kiley – were enough to sink the vote. Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote to advance legislation with his current margin.\n\nThe Senate has passed at least three resolutions rebuking Trump’s tariffs, but routinely ran into resistance in the House where members were blocked from forcing votes on the matter.\n\nBacon said in a statement posted to X, “I don’t like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”\n\nThe Nebraska congressman went on to say, “tariffs have been a ‘net negative’ for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying. Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It’s time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility.”\n\nGOP leaders had argued that lawmakers should allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in.\n\nSpeaker Johnson acknowledged the challenges he faces holding together his razor-thin majority after the failed vote.\n\n“Look, this is life with a small majority. I mean, you know, I need unanimity every day, and we didn’t get it tonight,” he told reporters.\n\n“The vast majority of the House Republicans agree wholeheartedly with the president, and we’re going to give him the latitude to continue his trade policy,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump has the right to amend a permit for a new bridge between Canada and Michigan, prolonging the latest dispute between the U.S. and its northern neighbor hours after its prime minister signaled there could be a detente.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge, which would connect Ontario and Michigan and would be a vital economic artery between the two countries, is scheduled to open in early 2026. But Trump has now threatened to block the bridge from being opened, calling for Canada to agree to a litany of unspecified demands as the two nations prepare to renegotiate a sprawling trade pact later this year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier Tuesday that he spoke with Trump and expressed confidence that the spat would be resolved. But a White House official later Tuesday said the ownership structure of the bridge remains unacceptable for the U.S. president.\n\nCanada paid for the bridge, named after a Canadian-born Detroit Red Wings hockey star. Construction has been underway since 2018.\n\nThe official said that all international infrastructure projects require a presidential permit, and that Trump would be within his right to amend that permit. The person was granted anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.\n\n“The fact that Canada will control what crosses the Gordie Howe Bridge and owns the land on both sides is unacceptable to the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.”\n\nThe new fight over the bridge is the latest volley in an increasingly sour relationship between the United States and Canada, particularly over trade policy. Trump has also mused publicly about acquiring Canada as the 51st U.S. state, much to the dismay of Canadians.\n\nFollowing his conversation with Trump, Carney said “this is going to be resolved” and noted that he told the U.S. president that the Canadian and Michigan governments shared ownership of the bridge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office has also emphasized that the bridge will be operated under a joint ownership agreement between the state and Canada, even though the Canadian government paid for it.\n\nCarney also added that U.S. steel was used in the project, which also employed U.S. workers. According to Carney, Trump told him he’ll ask the U.S. ambassador to Canada, former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra, to “play a role in smoothing the conversation in and around the bridge.”\n\nHoekstra did not return an immediate request for comment.\n\n“I look forward to it opening and what is particularly important is the commerce and the tourism of Canadians and Americans that go across that bridge,” Carney said.\n\nThe project was negotiated by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and paid for by the Canadian government to help ease congestion over the existing Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor tunnel.\n\nSnyder wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News on Tuesday that Trump was wrong in asserting that Canada owns both the U.S.- and Canadian sides of the Gordie Howe bridge.\n\n“Canada and the state of Michigan are 50/50 owners of the new bridge,\" Snyder wrote. “Canada was wonderful and financed the entire bridge. They will get repaid with interest from the tolls. Michigan and the United States got their half-ownership with no investment.”\n\nThe former governor also emphasized that parts of the bridge construction were exempt from “Buy America” requirements for its steel because half of the project was outside the U.S. and subsequently, U.S. law should not apply to them.\n\n“President Trump, I would encourage you to challenge your advisers and the sources for your post to correct the information they have provided,” Snyder wrote in the op-ed. He acknowledged some trade issues with Canada, but “picking this bridge as the leverage point doesn’t seem to make the most sense given your other tools.\"",

    "fullText": "Moderate House Republicans worried about this year’s midterm elections appear ready to finally break with President Donald Trump over his signature economic policy.\n\nIn a bid to protect Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly introduced procedural rules banning members from bringing up resolutions challenging the president’s crushing tariffs on products from dozens of U.S. trading partners.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson planned to ask the House to extend the ban through August. But this time, key Republicans signaled they would likely vote against the measure, Punchbowl reported.\n\n“American consumers pay the tariffs and thus it is a big tax,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told the outlet. “I support giving these authorities back to Congress.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley of California also told Punchbowl that he had “made it clear” he was not in favor of extending the blockade.\n\nWith full attendance, two Republican defectors would be enough to sink Johnson’s proposed extension, opening the door to a flood of Democratic resolutions challenging the increasingly unpopular tariffs.\n\nThe vote is likely to be close, as some Republicans are still holding out hope the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs, easing voters’ concerns while sparing them a confrontation with the president, according to Punchbowl.\n\nThe duties are a form of import tax paid by American companies, which must either eat the additional costs or pass them along to consumers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the bulk of the costs fall on foreign producers and middlemen, when in fact Americans “pay one way or the other—via higher prices or less choice,” the opinion editors of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote last week.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro acknowledged in December that U.S. manufacturing was down thanks to the tariffs, which have also contributed to higher prices and led to intense trade volatility.\n\nTariffs were also at the center of an international scandal last month after the president threatened to impose duties on products from countries that opposed his efforts to seize Greenland, an autonomous region of a fellow NATO country, Denmark.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the threat after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte talked him down during a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIf Johnson’s procedural vote fails, Democrats are likely to force votes as early as this week on resolutions to overturn Trump’s tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, followed by resolutions aimed at tariffs on Brazilian products and products from other global trade partners.\n\nThe Canada vote in particular would be a difficult one for Republicans and would require the White House’s intervention, Johnson told Puck.\n\nWhile Trump could ultimately veto any resolution reining in his trade wars, a rebuke from Congress would nevertheless be politically damaging.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposes President Trump's SAVE Act, an election bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote nationwide, saying states run elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against the SAVE Act, a sweeping election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to vote nationwide.\n\nIn doing so, she reminded her colleagues that they roundly claimed to oppose new federal election laws as recently as Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Murkowski said in a statement. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”\n\n“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she added.\n\nUnder current law, all U.S. voters must attest under oath that they are citizens, with criminal penalties for lying. Beyond that, states can set their own rules.\n\nThe SAVE Act would bar states from registering people to vote unless they provide documents or evidence proving U.S. citizenship. It would also require all Americans to present ID when they go to vote.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has 48 GOP co-sponsors, and Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass it in recent days. Even if it gains a majority of the Senate, it is subject to the 60-vote threshold, and Democrats have vowed to block it.\n\nWhile Trump and other SAVE Act backers say it’s designed to protect election integrity, Murkowski said it would do the opposite.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Democrats passed the For the People Act through the House, seeking to establish an aggressive set of federal rules to bolster voting rights and ban partisan gerrymandering. A majority of senators supported a slimmed-down version, called the Freedom to Vote Act, but it died because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n\nAt the time, Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the measure, saying election rules must be left to states.\n\n“This is not a federal issue,” McConnell told reporters in January 2022 when the bill came before the Senate. “It ought to be left to the states. There’s nothing broken around the country. The system upheld very well during an intense stress during the latter part of the previous Congress. There’s no rational basis for federalizing this election, and, therefore, there’s no point in having a debate in the U.S. Senate about something we ought not do.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — An annual meeting of the nation’s governors that has long served as a rare bipartisan gathering is unraveling after President Donald Trump excluded Democratic governors from White House events.\n\nThe National Governors Association said it will no longer hold a formal meeting with Trump when governors are scheduled to convene in Washington later this month, after the White House planned to invite only Republican governors. On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.\n\n“If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,” the group wrote. “Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.”\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican and the chairman of the NGA, said in a letter Monday to fellow governors obtained by The Associated Press that the White House intends to limit invitations to the association’s annual business meeting, scheduled for February 20, to Republican governors only.\n\n“Because NGA’s mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,” Stitt wrote.\n\nThe NGA is scheduled to meet in Washington from Feb. 19-21. Representatives for Stitt, the White House and the NGA didn't immediately comment on the letter.\n\nBrandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an “important tradition” and said the organization was “disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.”\n\nThe governors group is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. In his letter, Stitt encouraged governors to unite around common goals.\n\n“We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,” he wrote. “The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America’s governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.”\n\nSigns of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.\n\nTrump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump then predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe back and forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n\nPeoples reported from New York.",

    "description": "Donations get pushed through a nonprofit intermediary, which stands to see major profits as a result",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s plan to have private donors fund his new $400 million White House ballroom may cost him the entire project, as a federal judge will soon decide whether the administration is allowed to rely on fundraising to bypass congressional approval.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ricard Leon says he may rule this month on a lawsuit filed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in December to halt the ballroom’s construction, according to the Washington Post.\n\nTrump has argued that using private donations to pay for the project keeps the burden off taxpayers, but critics say the plan highlights a lack of transparency about how the expansion is being funded.\n\nDemocrats and watchdog groups have raised questions about the arrangement, which relies on donations from big corporations and businesses. The donations are then routed through a nonprofit intermediary, which also profits, having received millions of dollars in fees, according to the Post.\n\nThe Trump administration has already found a lengthy list of donors, including Big Tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google, HP and Microsoft — as well as other well-known companies like Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Palantir Technologies and T-Mobile.\n\nMost of the donors have declined to say how much they’ve given. However, the watchdog group CREW (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) says at least 22 companies involved in the project failed to disclose their donations in lobbying filings.\n\nDuring a hearing for the lawsuit brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation held in January, Leon shared his reservations about proceeding without congressional approval. He also questioned whether Trump possessed the statutory power to dismantle the East Wing and build a ballroom in its place without explicit oversight or authorization from Congress.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is urging the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit managing the project’s donations, to clarify its role and share information about the donations it has received.\n\nThe organization declined to provide details to the Post about the gifts, but said it collects between 2 and 2.5 percent of each donation as part of a management fee. A spokesperson said the fee is standard practice.\n\nThe White House has declined to specify how much money has been raised for the project, which has doubled in cost from its initial estimate of $200 million last summer.\n\n“President Trump is generously donating his time and resources to build a beautiful White House ballroom, a project which past presidents only dreamed about,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said. “Since announcing this historic plan, the White House has been inundated with calls from generous Americans and American companies wishing to contribute.”\n\nIn October, Trump hosted an opulent gala dinner for some of his sponsors in the East Room of the White House — which coincided with the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days.\n\nSoon after plans to replace the East Wing with a new ballroom were announced, demolition began without any extensive public review process. The ballroom is projected to be approximately 90,000 square feet, and the attached “New East Wing” complex will include a new office for the First Lady, a movie theater and commercial kitchen.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit filed in December says.\n\nHowever, in December Leon declined to immediately pause construction of the project, and Trump’s Department of Justice is moving to ensure that doesn’t change.\n\nA DOJ filing asked a federal judge overseeing the lawsuit to stay any injunction on the construction over alleged “national security” concerns, ABC News reported.\n\n\"[A]s the Secret Service attested, halting construction would imperil the President and others who live and work in the White House,\" the administration argues in the filing.\n\nThe Trump administration said it will also be submitting a second classified statement from the Secret Service to further support its argument that stopping construction at the site will \"endanger national security and therefore impair the public interest.\"\n\nThe filing claims that leaving the project incomplete would be a risk to national security. The DOJ filing comes after Judge Leon first made it clear he was skeptical of Trump’s claim that he could use private donations to fund the ballroom’s construction.",

    "description": "Large proportion worked at Columbia University, which had its grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.",
    "fullText": "France announced late last week that it would be awarding funds to 46 scientists as part of a high-profile initiative to recruit foreign researchers to the country with the promise of greater academic freedom. Almost all of them were previously at US institutions.\n\nThe more than €30-million Choose France for Science initiative, launched last April, is just one of a slew of European initiatives that aim to bring in research talent disaffected by changes elsewhere. These include the European Union's Choose Europe initiative, which is currently supported by nearly €900 million (US$1.1 billion) in research funding. The French programme will see 41 of the 46 recruits relocate to France from the United States. Eight of these researchers worked at Columbia University in New York City, which last year saw hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of its research grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe awardees include Zhongkai Tao, a mathematician studying the structures of waves and matter in physics. Previously at the University of California, Berkeley, Tao has now taken up his grant at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques or IHES) in Paris. Astrophysicist Kartik Sheth, who was associate chief scientist at NASA until he was fired by the agency during mass layoffs last year, has also been funded by the initiative. He will take up a three-year position at Aix-Marseille University in France.\n\nUnder Trump’s second presidency, US researchers have experienced grant cuts, the dismantling of science-funding agencies and increased federal control over universities. US foreign aid and awards to international collaborators have also been terminated. When announcing the call last year, Élisabeth Borne, then French minister for higher education and research, said that France would offer a “refuge” to researchers as “science and research face unprecedented threats worldwide”.\n\nThe high proportion of US scientists among those recruited by the programme shows that “enthusiasm and morale for doing science is low” in the United States, says Sharon Milgram, who led early-career researcher training and education programmes at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for nearly 20 years, until she retired in December.\n\nYet a few dozen vacating scientists are unlikely to make a large dent at US academic institutions, which altogether have more than 1.5 million faculty members, she says. France and other countries hoping to lure US scientists face an uphill battle: funders such as the NIH, with their multibillion-dollar budgets, are irreplaceable, Milgram adds. Tens of thousands of scientists, rather than dozens, would need to relocate for it to have a big long-term impact on US science, she says.\n\nColumbia University, which had most of its grants reinstated and unfrozen after the institution agreed to pay US$200 million to settle claims that it had failed to combat campus antisemitism, did not respond to Nature’s queries about its researchers leaving the institution.\n\nOf the 46 awardees, 19 are US nationals, 13 are French and 8 are originally from other European nations. The largest share are researchers studying climate, biodiversity and sustainable societies, according to the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The ministry declined to identify the 46 awardees, citing safety reasons.\n\nBut it did reveal that almost half of the awardees are headed to higher-education institutions in and around Paris. And 12 are going to Aix-Marseille University, which launched its own ‘Safe Place for Science’ initiative, worth about €15 million (US$17.9 million). The university said that the programme was launched “in a context where some scientists in the United States may feel threatened or hindered in their research”.\n\nAmong them is Alka Patel, a historian of art and architecture, previously at the University of California Irvine.\n\nMeanwhile, Tao says he decided to move to France because the IHES is “a world-leading institute of mathematics” and he will be surrounded in Paris by a strong maths community. “Certainly, the Choose France funding shows that the French government supports researchers from all over the world,” he adds. With the funding, Tao says that he will establish a research group and study uncertainty principles and geometric spectral theory.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00405-2\n\nEpstein files reveal deeper ties to scientists than previously known\n\nUS grant applications surge at prestigious European research agency\n\nIs UK science in jeopardy?

    "description": "France's Dassault Aviation is currently working on the F5 standard Rafale fighter, also known as the Super Dassault Rafale. How will it compare to the F-35?",
    "fullText": "Whenever there's a discussion around fighter jets, it usually veers towards U.S., Russian, and Chinese-made planes. These include usual suspects like the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning, Russia's Sukhoi Su-57, and the Chinese J-20. While these are advanced planes without an iota of doubt, what most people tend to forget about is the Dassault Rafale. A fourth generation multirole fighter jet designed and developed by French aviation major Dassault, the Rafale is widely thought to be one of the most advanced and formidable fighter jets to ever exist.\n\nOperational since 2004, more than 300 Rafales have been manufactured and have been deployed around the world. Dassault has regularly updated the Rafale, starting with the F1 standard Rafale in 2004, the F2 standard Rafale in 2006, and the F3 standard Rafale developed in 2008. In 2018, Dassault debuted the F-3R Standard Rafale, which was followed by the newest generation of the fighter, the F4 standard Rafale, along with the F4.1 and 4.2 sub-variants.\n\nGiven that Dassault has steadily improved and added newer capabilities to the Rafale over the years, it's not surprising that the company has planned further upgrades to the fighter to keep it operational and relevant well into the 2060s. Dassault's next major upgrade path for the Rafale is the Rafale F5 Standard, which is also unofficially dubbed by many as the Super Dassault Rafale.\n\nPredictably the upcoming Rafale variant will be compared against America's F-35. However, most aviation enthusiasts would know that these two fighter jets cannot be directly compared. The F-35 and the Rafale F5 are not only built for different purposes, they also belong to two entirely different generations of fighter jets.\n\nBefore comparing the Super Dassault Rafale and the F-35, it is important to note that only one of these planes is in service today: the F-35 Lightning. We have already discussed how the Rafale F5 Standard is still in its developmental stages, and per current projections, this version will only enter service in 2030 or later.\n\nMoving on to the capabilities of both planes, the biggest advantage the F-35 has over the Rafale F5 is that it is based on a newer and more advanced platform. The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter, built from the ground up as a stealth aircraft. It stands out from the current generation of multirole fighters in several ways, and it is widely considered to be the most advanced fighter jet in existence today.\n\nThe Rafale, on the other hand, started life as a fourth-generation fighter, and following several upgrades, it is now classified as a 4.5 or 4.5+ generation aircraft. While it cannot match the F-35 in terms of stealth, the Rafale has excellent electronic warfare capabilities, it can carry a larger number of weapons in typical combat missions, and is cheaper to buy and operate. The Super Dassault Rafale is also slated to receive support for UCAS (Unmanned Combat Air System) drones, a capability that the U.S. is also currently working on.\n\nIn simpler words, while the Super Dassault Rafale will be a formidable, advanced 4.5-generation multirole fighter jet, it falls short of the F-35 in several areas, simply based on fact that the F-35 is a newer-generation fighter. A more direct competitor to the F-35 would be the upcoming sixth-gen fighters; including Europe's Future Combat Air System (FCAS), as well as the U.S.' own, in-development GCAP fighters.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it’s waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organization the Trump administration intends to pay and when the money will arrive.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.\n\nThe U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations confirmed that U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears in a matter of weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time,” and the U.N.’s controller also has been in touch with U.S. officials.\n\n”We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.\n\nGuterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the U.N.'s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and it has withdrawn from U.N. organizations, including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO, while pulling funding from dozens of others.\n\nU.N. officials have said 95% of the arrears to the U.N.’s regular budget is from the United States.\n\nThe country second on the list for not paying its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela, which owes $38 million, the U.N. official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before the U.S. military raid in January that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro, has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.\n\nNearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb. 8 due date.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE’s lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly.\n\nThe Democrats’ statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.”\n\nThune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.”\n\nBut coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAnd many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back.\n\n“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers.\n\nDemocrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nAmong other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepublicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks.\n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.”\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.”\n\n“The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said.\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions.\n\n“If there’s additional time that’s needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said.\n\nMany Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations.\n\n“The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday.",

    "description": "What happened between them?",
    "fullText": "President Trump is notorious for his emotional ups and downs and for turning on people on a dime. So, it’s not surprising that someone like Jeff Bezos would be trying hard to stay in the President’s good graces. This entire presidency, we’ve seen business leaders from all sides of the political aisle try to integrate themselves with Trump, because that’s beneficial for their business. Business first, morals later. Or something.\n\nNow, there are reports that the recent layoffs at the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, might have had something to do with Trump. Martin Baron, former executive editor of the Post, told Jen Psaki on “The Briefing” that the layoffs were related to Trump.\n\nBad Bunny's Real Feelings About Trump Resurface as the President Calls His Super Bowl Performance 'Disgusting' & the 'Worst Ever'\n\nGreen Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a 'Terrible Choice'\n\nAccording to Barron, when he joined the Washington Post in 2013, “It was a great news organization then,” even if “it had faced many challenges.\n\n“[Bezos] acquired the paper about a year after I had been there. He invested. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the Post. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the press in this country,” he said, adding that the paper “grew under the ownership” of Bezos.\n\nBut he was clear that the layoffs “represent a turn back.”\n\n“It suggests that this newspaper, with a deep heritage and historically high ambitions, is going to retreat,” he explained. “And it’s a terrible thing to see a news organization that’s been so important to the history of this country retreat the way that this newspaper is doing.”\n\nAll of this, Baron said, can be traced back to Trump. “I explain it by saying the words ‘Donald Trump.’ That’s what happened.”\n\n“Trump came into office again,” Baron said. “He had promised vengeance against his perceived political enemies. Jeff Bezos was seen as a political enemy by Donald Trump for one reason and one reason only, and that was the coverage of the Washington Post.”\n\nAnd that coverage was, of course, not always positive. Baron was clear that he believed Bezos feared repercussions for him and his business due to the Washington Post’s reporting.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House, Baron said he believed Bezos was afraid the administration would target him and his other businesses for the Post’s journalism. “And so he has sought to navigate this administration during the second term,” Baron explained. And that apparently means scaling back the negative coverage of Trump and moving more towards the center, something Baron was very critical of. This is also something that has been pointed out by many others as over 300 journalists were fired from the Washington Post in recent days, with the entirety of the books and sports section and most of its international coverage being shut down.\n\n“This is a newspaper that has prided itself on its independence, and the behavior of Jeff Bezos has suggested to the readers that he is not independent at all,” Baron said. “He’s actually dependent — dependent on Donald Trump.”\n\nNot a good sign for one of the most important newspapers in the country, one whose logline is: Democracy Dies in Darkness.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul would place a lower student-loan limit on certain advanced degrees, including nursing.",
    "fullText": "Nursing programs are taking center stage in the public conversation on President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul.\n\nPublic comment on the Department of Education's proposed student-loan changes has been open for one week, giving anyone the opportunity to submit feedback. Those changes include new income-driven repayment plans, updates to the handling of defaulted student loans, and new borrowing caps for advanced programs.\n\nThe new borrowing caps, in particular, have sparked conversation and concern among advocates, lawmakers, and students. The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is \"fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as \"fairness and respect.\"\n\n\"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies. In January, Trump also warned that he could impose a 50% tariff on aircraft manufactured in Canada and revoke certification for newly produced planes.\n\nThe White House and the Ontario Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief.\n\nIn a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits.\n\n“Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching.\n\nThe administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled.\n\n“The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren's office.\n\nA spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time.\n\nThe bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nAnother roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThe bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year.\n\nThere's also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%.\n\nThe independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate.\n\nThe GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management.\n\nMark Paoletta, the bureau's chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.",

    "fullText": "Following the U.S. operation that led to the removal of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the start of January, President Donald Trump has made repeated threats on the Caribbean island nation of Cuba.\n\nAfter calling the country \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, the Trump administration has blocked all Cuban oil supplies and threatened to impose tariffs on any country that provides them.\n\nWith the main supply cut off following Maduro's removal, the Cuban government warned that the country is close to running out of oil in a way that will disrupt any airlines trying to land there for refueling stops. For a month beginning Feb. 9, Cuba is suspending oil supplies to foreign airlines to address the energy crisis, CNBC reported.\n\nThis means airlines including American Airlines, Air Canada, and Air France, which run multiple flights into the country, will need to either carry enough backup jet fuel or arrange for refueling stops in nearby Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic or Jamaica.\n\nThe move affects both the central Havana Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) and smaller airports in Cuban cities including Varadero, Holguín, Manzanillo, and Santa Clara.\n\nWhile Mexico had previously attempted to boost oil supplies to Cuba, the threat of tariffs has led to it pulling back. The humanitarian situation, reported by Reuters, has reached critical levels, where many portions of the country are left without power.\n\nCanadian national airline Air Canada has made major cutbacks of its Cuba service and has run primarily non-revenue flights out of the country to get stranded travelers back home.\n\nAir France has confirmed to French news service AFP that it will reroute its refueling stops to other countries in the Caribbean.\n\n\"We will operate as scheduled out of Cuba, carrying passengers to Canada,\" an Air Canada airline representative said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation to ensure safe and reliable operations for our passengers and crew and will share more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines, which at this time of the year runs more than 70 weekly flights to Cuban cities like Havana and Holguín from Miami International (MIA), is another airline that could see significant disruption by the Cuban NOTAM that prevents foreign carrier refueling.\n\nAirline to launch unusual new flight to Cayman Islands from the U.S.\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nUnexpected country is most luxurious travel destination for 2026\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions from House lawmakers in a deposition Monday, but indicated that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she was willing to testify that neither he nor former President Bill Clinton had done anything wrong in their relationships with Epstein.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she’s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating. She’s come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.\n\nAmid a reckoning over Epstein's abuse that has spilled into nations around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. So far, the revelations have shown how both Trump and Clinton spent time with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the closed-door deposition Monday, an attorney for Maxwell told lawmakers that if Trump granted her clemency, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting.\n\nDemocrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.\n\n“It’s very clear she’s campaigning for clemency,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, described Maxwell’s demeanor during the short video call as “robotic” and “unrepentant.”\n\nTrump has not ruled out granting Maxwell clemency, but Republican pushback to that notion quickly rose after Maxwell made the appeal.\n\n“NO CLEMENCY. You comply or face punishment,” Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, wrote on social media. “You deserve JUSTICE for what you did you monster.”\n\nMaxwell has been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as “substantial new evidence” that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.\n\nMaxwell's attorney cited that petition as he told lawmakers she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, told reporters that it was “very disappointing” that Maxwell declined to participate in the deposition.\n\nFamily members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her “a bystander” to Epstein's abuse.\n\n“You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,” Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nComer had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn't answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.\n\nComer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.\n\nMeanwhile, several lawmakers also planned on Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the Department of Justice has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year.",
