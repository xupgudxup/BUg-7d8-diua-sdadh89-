    "description": "Brett Ratner, known for the 'Rush Hour' films, returns with a Melania Trump documentary after 2017 misconduct allegations.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than a decade since Brett Ratner directed a major motion picture, and nearly a decade since six women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nNow he appears to be staging a comeback with a little help from President Donald Trump.\n\nRatner directed the authorized documentary about first lady Melania Trump, which premiered in theaters on Friday.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that the director is also working on a docuseries about the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements to normalize relations between Israel and some Arab countries that were mediated by the US during Trump's first term.\n\n\"Melania\" is getting a limited theatrical run before it begins streaming on Amazon, which paid $40 million to license the film.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work beside you during this past year,\" Ratner wrote of Melania in an Instagram post. \"I look forward to showing the world what an incredible First Lady you are!\"\n\nRatner's return comes after he stepped back from the public eye around 2017, when he faced sexual misconduct and harassment accusations at the height of the #MeToo era.\n\nHere's a look at the rise, fall, and return of Ratner's career.\n\nRatner is a Miami Beach-native who broke into the entertainment industry in the 1990s. Ratner made his directorial debut in 1997 with \"Money Talks,\" an action-comedy starring Chris Tucker and Charlie Sheen.\n\nHe also directed music videos for artists such as Madonna, Mariah Carey, D'Angelo, and Heavy D.\n\nRatner struck gold when he directed \"Rush Hour,\" a buddy-cop film starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker that hit theaters in 1998.\n\nThe film became a box-office success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, according to the movie financial analysis site The Numbers.\n\nHe went on to direct other notable Hollywood projects, including \"Red Dragon,\" \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" and \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nRatner also has production credits to his name. During his career, he's produced shows like \"Prison Break\" and the 2011 film \"Horrible Bosses.\"\n\nRatner and Australian billionaire James Packer founded RatPac Entertainment in 2012. The company found early success when it financed \"Gravity,\" a 2013 sci-fi thriller starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.\n\nIn addition to commercial and critical acclaim, \"Gravity\" won numerous awards, including seven Academy Awards, six BAFTA awards, and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nRatPac Entertainment cemented itself as a serious industry player in 2013 when it partnered with Dune Entertainment to secure a deal with Warner Bros. The deal involved RatPac Entertainment financing more than $1 billion for 75 movies, such as \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"\n\nRatner snagged a role producing the 84th Academy Awards, but stepped down after using a homophobic slur during a press event for his film \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nHe apologized in a statement to outlets in 2011, saying, \"It was a dumb way of expressing myself. Everyone who knows me knows that I don't have a prejudiced bone in my body. But as a storyteller, I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.\"\n\nRatner accepted the Ally Award from GLAAD in 2013 for working on a pro-LGBTQ PSA campaign.\n\nSix women — including actor Olivia Munn — accused Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct in a 2017 article with The Los Angeles Times.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner disputed the accusations at the time. He has never been charged with any crimes.\n\n\"I have represented Mr. Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment,\" the spokesperson said. \"Furthermore, no woman has ever requested or received any financial settlement from my client.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the accusations, in 2018, Warner Bros. chose not to renew its co-financing deal with RatPac Entertainment and Dune Entertainment.\n\nRatner stepped back from public life following the accusations. The last major motion picture he directed was \"Hercules,\" released in 2014, making \"Melania\" his largest project in over a decade.\n\nAmazon paid about $40 million to license the documentary, which will have a theatrical run before streaming on Prime Video. The deal also included a docuseries.\n\nMelania Trump, first lady of the United States, and President Donald Trump attended the film's world premiere in January.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that he's set to direct \"Rush Hour 4,\" which is in development.\n\nAlthough nearly a decade has passed since \"Rush Hour 3\" debuted in theaters, the franchise's revival may — in part — be the work of Trump.\n\nSemafor reported that Trump \"personally\" urged Paramount's owner to revive the \"Rush Hour\" series for new audiences.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman warns that Trump's trade policies are a threat to the US economy.\n\nTrump's tactics are leading to strained relations with trade partners, Krugman says.\n\nHe predicts a \"divorce\" between the US and major trading partners.\n\nPaul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "title": "King Charles Is Reportedly 'Horrified' By Prince Harry's Response To Donald Trump's Claims 'Insulting' And 'Appalling' Comments About UK Soldiers 'Staying Back' During War In Afghanistan: This Isn't 'Podcast Politics'",
    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "title": "The Trump Administration Arrested Don Lemon Like He Was a Fugitive Slave",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "Lemon’s arrest is not only a clear violation of the First Amendment but also a blatant throwback to the Constitution’s long-discarded Fugitive Slave Clause.\n\nThe Department of Justice arrested two journalists, Don Lemon, and Georgia Fort, in connection with their coverage of a protest that took place inside a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 18. The DOJ also arrested two activists, Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy, for their role in the protest. All four of the people arrested are Black.\n\nThe arrests of the two journalists are clearly unconstitutional. You don’t need to be a legal scholar to know that arresting journalists for covering the news is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Lemon’s arrest is also flatly illegal. Last week, the Trump administration went to a federal magistrate judge, Douglas L. Micko, to ask for an arrest warrant for Lemon. The judge refused. The Trump administration then appealed and lost that appeal. The legal system literally said the government couldn’t arrest Lemon, but the government arrested him anyway, and they went all the way to Los Angeles (far from Minnesota) to get him.\n\nGeorgia Fort is a prominent Black journalist based in Minnesota. She was out front in covering the George Floyd protests, and expertly covered the trial of his killer, Derek Chauvin. I have little doubt that this prior reporting is among the reasons she was targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nI know less about the activists: Crews is a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, while Lundy works in the Hennepin County Attorney’s office and recently announced his candidacy for the Minnesota state Senate. I also know that arresting people for protesting is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn her tweet proclaiming the arrests, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the four were arrested “at my direction.” Later reports suggested that the DOJ empaneled a federal grand jury that issued the arrest warrants for Lemon and Fort, but didn’t explain the cause for arresting Crews and Lundy. Going to a grand jury to get an arrest warrant that a judge and appeals court previously denied on constitutional grounds is highly unusual in a democracy, but I guess it’s how the fascists play the game.\n\nI expect, at a minimum, that the arrests of Lemon and Fort will be thrown out in court eventually, since at least one of them already has been. I think the more important question is why all four of these Black people were arrested. To answer that question, we should start with the White House’s official tweet about Lemon’s arrest. They tweeted out: “When life gives you lemons…” followed by a chain emoji. This ties the arrest of Lemon to this country’s history of slavery in a way no sane person will miss.\n\nThe arrest of Lemon harks back to a discarded portion of our original Constitution: the Fugitive Slave Clause. That clause read: “No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.” It’s relevant because the Fugitive Slave Clause counteracted a different amendment in the Constitution, the 10th, which explicitly reserves all “police power” to the states.\n\nTo put it simply, the 10th Amendment says that states are in charge of deciding whom they need to arrest, but the Fugitive Slave Clause says the federal government can violate the 10th Amendment—if they need to capture Black people. Fundamentally, that is what’s happened to Lemon. The federal government has superseded the constitutional authority of Minnesota so that it can arrest a Black man who got away. And we know that’s how they’re thinking, because they’re using literal chain emojis to congratulate themselves on their accomplishment.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is an obvious attempt to change the face of the victims of Trump’s fascism. I believe the Trump administration always assumed that the people on the front lines of the resistance to their tactics would be Black and brown. They assumed that the people who would be getting brutalized in the streets and shot and killed would be people of color. They did not assume that the victim of their brutality would be a white man who was a nurse for veterans. They did not assume it would be a white woman with children’s plushies in her glove compartment.\n\nArresting Black journalists and activists, and using explicit slavery imagery while doing it, is an attempt to inflame the Black community and remind white folks who the real targets are. Support for ICE and the Trump administration generally is falling among white folks. Trump wants to remind those white folks that he’s really just trying to arrest dangerous Black people.\n\nTrump and Steven Miller want a race war. They think they’ll win it. They think white people will tune in for it. Their operating theory is that most white people are viciously racist, like they are, and that most whites secretly pine to live in apartheid South Africa.\n\nI don’t think they’re right—and I say that as a person who is not known to have a particularly high opinion of the moral clarity of white Americans. My read has always been that most white people in this country are like most people who eat meat in this country: they want to enjoy a good steak, but they don’t want to go to a slaughterhouse and put a bolt gun in a cow. White people enjoy their privilege, but they don’t exactly want to see how their privilege gets made.\n\nArresting a journalist like Lemon—who is not only “Black famous” like Fort is but crossover famous among white folks—is as likely to inflame the white community as it is to inflame the Black community. Lemon got arrested last night while covering the Grammys, of all things, not the Image Awards.\n\nThe arrests of the journalists cannot hold up legally. (The arrests of the activists shouldn’t hold up legally either, as Bondi is claiming the activist violated the First Amendment rights of churchgoers while Bondi is violating the First Amendment rights of protesters.) It is a shredding of the First Amendment that I don’t think even Trump’s plants on the Supreme Court can stand for (except for Clarence Thomas, who is probably titillated about the opportunity to use the Fugitive Slave Clause as the basis for his dissenting opinion from the more sane members of the court). I also don’t think the arrests will hold up socially. I don’t think they will change the narrative in the way Trump and Miller probably hope it will.\n\nOf course, the road to bad takes is paved with a reliance on white people to do the right thing. I don’t think this will work, legally or culturally, but I’ll need white people to prove me right.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's monthslong and contentious search for a new commissioner to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics may be ending.\n\nOn a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Brett Matsumoto, a longtime agency economist, to lead the BLS.\n\nThe BLS commissioner role has been vacant since August, when Trump fired Erika McEntarfer after the release of a jobs report showing weak employment growth. Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the data had been politically manipulated. The allegation and removal have since undermined public trust in one of the federal government's most closely watched statistical agencies, which is supposed to remain nonpartisan.\n\nThe agency has roughly 2,000 employees, and the commissioner is its only appointed position. The commissioner's role carries a four-year term and requires Senate confirmation.\n\nBefore Matsumoto, the White House previously nominated EJ Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist, for the job, but later withdrew the nomination after it became clear Antoni lacked sufficient support for Senate confirmation.\n\nMatsumoto is a career economist with deep ties to the agency he would lead if confirmed.\n\nBased on Matsumoto's LinkedIn profile, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Delaware before earning his doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina in 2015. Since then, he has been working at the BLA as a supervisory research economist. Multiple academic papers under his name can be found covering issues such as consumer expenditure and inflation measurement. Over the past year, he has been on assignment at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMatsumoto is not very active on social media. A Facebook account under his name shows that his profile picture used to be a photo with Ivanka Trump back in August 2020. His most recent profile photo features him alongside a tabby cat.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social late Friday, Trump said he was confident Matsumoto had the expertise to \"QUICKLY fix the long history of issues at the BLS on behalf of the American People.\"\n\nSeveral economists posted online that they believe Matsumoto could be the right choice.\n\nClaudia Sahm, Chief Economist at New Century Advisors, posted on X that Matsumoto is an \"excellent choice\" for the commissioner position.\n\nSkanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, echoed the sentiment on X and said that Matsumoto is \"a very thoughtful person who understands the nuts and bolts of data measurement and estimation.\"",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal judge warned Justice Department lawyers on Friday that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said the Trump Administration can decide what part of American history to display at National Park Service sites.\n\nThe sharp exchange erupted during a hearing in Philadelphia over the abrupt removal of an exhibit on the history of slavery at the site of the former President’s House on Independence Mall.\n\nThe city, which worked in tandem with the park service on the exhibit two decades ago, was stunned to find workers this month using crowbars to remove outdoor plaques, panels and other materials that told the stories of the nine people who had been enslaved there. Some of the history had only been unearthed in the past quarter-century.\n\n“You can’t erase history once you’ve learned it.

In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "description": "Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian aircraft has stirred safety concerns among analysts who caution against politicizing aircraft certification.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian-made aircraft — the backbone of many US carriers' regional jet fleet — is a threat to aviation safety, industry watchers said Friday.\n\nThe president also doesn't have the authority to unilaterally declare planes unworthy to fly in the US, Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry authority and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider. That authority belongs to the FAA.\n\nThe trade spat — another in a continuing back-and-forth between Trump and Canada — comes after Canada hasn't fully certified newer US-made Gulfstream jets to fly in its skies. (It has certified older models.) Gulfstream planes are used almost exclusively by private aviation companies, governments, and the ultrawealthy.\n\nTrump said on Thursday night, in a Truth Social post, that he would \"decertify\" Canada-made Bombardier jets until Canada approved the Gulfstream models. He also threatened a 50% tariff on \"any and all\" Canadian aircraft sold in the US until the situation was corrected.\n\nBombardier said in a statement that it's in contact with the Canadian government. The FAA referred Business Insider to the White House. A White House official said decertification would not immediately affect aircraft already in operation; it would apply only to new deliveries.\n\nThat would be a relief for US airlines like American, Delta, and United, whose regional affiliates operate Bombardier CRJ aircraft to cities across the country.\n\nStill, any move to decertify these more than 2,000 passenger airliners and private jets — part of almost 5,550 Canadian-made aircraft and helicopters certified in the US, according to Cirium — could trigger thousands of flight cancellations a day. A 50% tariff would likely raise airline ticket prices.\n\nAviation analysts said Trump's threat posed a safety risk in itself.\n\n\"Anything that intrudes on the turf of safety regulators coming from politics, trade issues, or personal grievances is a very, very bad idea,\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the aviation consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider.\n\nAboulafia said aircraft certification is intentionally non-political for a reason: Regulators are meant to evaluate risk, not respond to trade threats. Once certification becomes a political weapon, trust in the system erodes for manufacturers, operators, and the flying public, he contended.\n\nIn Canada's case, the delay in certification is likely not obstructionism but the result of independent regulatory decisions.\n\nFor the Gulfstream G700 and G800, Canada hasn't completed its own certification, while the FAA has granted Gulfstream a temporary exemption from certain fuel‑icing rules designed to ensure aircraft engines and systems operate safely in extreme cold.\n\nThe FAA waiver means Gulfstream has until the end of this year to meet those requirements — meaning the aircraft is operating under essentially conditional certification in the US, despite being allowed to be delivered.\n\nThese waivers are not unusual and are typically granted to allow new aircraft to enter service while completing certain technical tests and paperwork, rather than because the planes are unsafe.\n\nStill, history shows what can sometimes go wrong when thorough certification and safety protocols are deprioritized. The most consequential example was the Boeing 737 Max, which suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 due to systemic design issues, killing 346 people.\n\nMore recently, in early 2024, a door plug separated on another 737 Max due to quality-control issues at Boeing's Washington factory, further exacerbating scrutiny of production and certification. No one died in that incident.\n\nPart of the reason the 737 Max issues slipped past regulators is that, for decades, global authorities often relied on reciprocal approvals, effectively rubber-stamping each other's certifications to speed aircraft to market.\n\nThe Max disasters exposed the risks of that approach. Today, regulators — including those in Canada — are expected to conduct their own full assessments rather than automatically rely on approvals from foreign authorities.\n\nThe FAA itself is taking extra precautions before certifying the Boeing 737 Max 7 and 10, as both aircraft have technical problems that could lead to engine overheating. Boeing initially asked for a waiver but rescinded it amid the scrutiny.",

    "title": "'Melania' isn't good. But it isn't for you, anyway.",
    "description": "Even diehard Trump fans might be bored by the documentary about the first lady. But this movie, \"Melania,\" is for an audience of one.",
    "fullText": "Let's get this out of the way: \"Melania,\" the new documentary about first lady Melania Trump, is not a good movie.\n\nI mean: It's possible you'll like it if you're a Trump superfan who likes everything Trump does.\n\nThe movie is full of drone shots and lingering looks in and outside of SUVs and private planes. There are lots of glimpses inside the White House, Trump Tower, and Mar-a-Lago. There's also some very expensive music licensing that brings you a sampling of artists you might hear at the beginning of a Trump rally, including the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, and Tears for Fears. (There's also a stirring rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" by Aretha Franklin that's the most moving thing in there, and jarring in context.)\n\nBut I think even director Brett Ratner knows he's made a dull, inert product, where zero interesting things happen. That is presumably why, halfway through the one-hour, 44-minute-long movie, he starts inserting grainy Super 8-style footage into the shots, simply to give the thing additional texture. Like crumbling some crackers on top of a sodden hot dish.\n\nThe best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed). It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\n\nBut that's just my opinion. What does someone who hasn't been reporting on the damage caused by Donald Trump's administration think?\n\n\"I think it's perfectly well made,\" says Jamal Caesar, who describes himself as a writer/director who is also a Melania fan. \"I think everyone, actually, will like this movie.\"\n\nI talked to Caesar on Friday afternoon, after watching a 10:30 am \"Melania\" screening near Union Square in Manhattan. My thought was that I could find other people there who weren't me to interview about the movie.\n\nAlas, 11 of the 14 other people in the theater were other journalists or their friends, doing what I was doing. One of the other three was a woman who said she liked someone involved in the movie, but didn't want me to identify her. \"Hell no. I'm not a Trumper.\" The two other men had told me before the movie started that they weren't journalists. They zipped out of the theater before I could ask them what they thought.\n\nSo, for the record: Caesar, who says he went to both Trump inaugurations, said he thinks the movie is particularly good at showing \"opulence — one of the things Trump and their family is most known for.\"\n\n\"Everyone is sort of interested in glamour, and that's what this brings to life,\" he added.\n\nWill other people actually watch, and/or like, this movie? We have no idea. We know that Amazon is spending a reported $75 million on production and marketing for \"Melania,\" and distributing it widely in theaters before it starts streaming on Amazon's Prime Video later this year. So everyone's going to get a chance to weigh in, one way or another.\n\nAnd it's the opposite of surprising that a morning Manhattan screening — on a very, very cold day — only brought a handful of ticket buyers/professional rubber-neckers. Puck's Matt Belloni says he's seen projections that show the viewership for this one — at least in theaters — will be roughly split between red and blue geographies. So we'll see.\n\nBut of course, the whole point of this movie isn't to generate big box-office numbers, or even to generate more Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nAmazon's spending on this documentary is so out of scale with any other doc that the only way to view it is as a gift from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to the Trump administration — one of the many, many donations American businessmen have made to the administration in the last year. (Amazon's stock line about this: \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\")\n\nSo the only real question for Bezos and Trump is: Was it worth it?",

    "fullText": "First lady Melania Trump is no stranger to cameras, but this time, she's the one calling the shots.\n\nHer new documentary, \"Melania: Twenty Days to History,\" provides a glimpse into her life and work during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. Released in theaters on Friday, the first lady served as both its star and producer.\n\n\"She's a very private and very selective person as to who she speaks to and what she does,\" Marc Beckman, Melania Trump's senior advisor and a producer of the film, told Business Insider. \"We thought that this would be the appropriate opportunity to share a little bit more, to open the lens a little bit more into her family life, her career, and her philanthropy, all as she becomes first lady of the United States of America again.\"\n\nBeckman said that the first lady was deeply involved in the film's creation.\n\n\"She participated not just with the creative direction, but in production and post-production,\" Beckman said. \"She was in the edit room. She was helping with color correction. She was very much involved with music selection — every song was selected by her.\"\n\nAfter its theatrical run, \"Melania\" will stream on Amazon, which paid $40 million for the film and a forthcoming docuseries set for release this summer.\n\nHere are the most surprising moments and revelations from the documentary.\n\nThe film opens with \"Billie Jean\" by Michael Jackson playing over aerial footage of Mar-a-Lago. The song reappears later as Melania Trump sings along while riding in the car and names it her favorite Michael Jackson hit.\n\n\"Melania\" follows Melania Trump as she divides her time between Trump Tower in New York City, Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Florida estate holds special meaning for the first lady, who remembers it as the place \"where Baron took his swim lessons with his grandfather, played golf with his father, and took his first tennis lesson with me.\"\n\nCarter's funeral was held on January 9, 2025, one year to the day after the death of Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs.\n\n\"Grief comes in waves when you lose someone who means so much to you. I will be sitting in the Washington Cathedral, paying respect to President Carter, but I know my beloved mother will be on my mind,\" she said in the film's voiceover.\n\nIn the film, Pierre said the seams on the dress were entirely hidden beneath the black band zigzagging across it.\n\n\"You don't give the recipe,\" he said. \"It's like a mystery.\"\n\nThe film showed a video call between Macron and Melania Trump, where they spoke about working together on her Fostering the Future and Be Best initiatives focused on children's well-being.\n\n\"My next step and my next goal is to foster relationships and work on it with like-minded leaders and establish a coalition,\" Melania Trump said. \"And when we do, I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure. I go everywhere with you,\" Macron said.\n\nIn the days leading up to her return to the White House, Melania Trump also recruited Queen Rania of Jordan for her coalition during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAviva Siegel was held for 51 days before being released on November 26, 2023, as part of a temporary ceasefire deal brokered by the Biden administration. In the documentary, Melania Trump comforted Siegel and pledged Donald Trump's support for releasing the remaining hostages, including Siegel's husband, Keith Siegel.\n\n\"I know that once he's commander in chief, I know that's his priority. I'm sure of it,\" Melania Trump said.\n\nOne of the final title cards of the film reads: \"Melania Trump played a key role in securing the release of Keith Siegel after 484 days as a hostage in Gaza, just 12 days after the inauguration.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Knavs was shown holding a handheld camcorder and filming his daughter in the background of public appearances.\n\n\"My father always filmed these special moments when I was a child,\" Melania Trump said in the film's voiceover narration. \"He showed me the world through his lens, the essence of living life with passion and purpose.\"\n\n\"Walking into the Capitol Rotunda, I felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant — a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,\" she said in the film's narration. \"Everyone should do what they can to protect our individual rights. Never take them for granted because in the end, no matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.\"\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady, Melania Trump has previously spoken about her \"arduous\" pathway to citizenship.\n\nThough the move was due to frigid temperatures in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day, Melania Trump said she preferred an indoor space for security reasons after her husband survived an assassination attempt in July 2024.\n\n\"Being in a more secure and closed space brought a certain peace of mind,\" she said.\n\nIn a scene toward the end of the film, Donald Trump was shown practicing an inauguration speech as Melania Trump watched.\n\n\"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker,\" he said.\n\nHer addition made it into the final draft of Donald Trump's inauguration speech.\n\nMahaux, who has photographed the Trump family for over 20 years, describes Melania Trump as \"very reserved, but deeply intentional.\"\n\n\"I think what people don't always see in her is a curiosity that she has for the world,\" she told Business Insider. \"I think the documentary reflects her sense of duty, her discipline.\"\n\nMahaux also took Melania Trump's White House portrait during Donald Trump's first term in 2017.\n\n\"The first portrait was about discovering her new duty and her new role, and now this time, the portrait was an affirmation,\" Mahaux said. \"She really knew what she was. She was really embracing it and ready to get to work.\"",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "description": "The race is set for August, leaving a tight timeline for the ambitious program to come together.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the president has signed an executive order directing the creation of an IndyCar race on Washington D.C.'s Capitol Mall. The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "fullText": "More than 10 years after its delivery, warnings from Donald Trump’s June 2015 presidential candidacy announcement continue to resonate. He decried the high cost of the Affordable Care Act medical insurance subsidies. He sounded a warning about the federal debt, then at $18 trillion, calling $24 trillion in debt the point of no return.\n\nAbout 15 months later, beginning with speeches in October 2016, he added a third dire warning about Washington’s entrenched bureaucracy. His call for a Constitutional amendment for term limits on Congress, and his phrase “drain the swamp,” drew huge positive reaction to crowds attending campaign rallies.\n\nAs this month ends, a cataclysmic controversy over the Dept. of Homeland Security threatens another partial government shutdown. The federal debt sits at more than $38.5 trillion. Despite the efforts of DOGE and actions which have dismantled some parts of government, such as the Department of Education — entrenched bureaucrats still hold massive power in and around the Beltway.\n\nAnother paralyzing problem is the vexing overreach of the judiciary. According to the non-profit Lawfare, there are now 253 active court cases challenging Trump’s administration actions as president. And although Supreme Court rulings have frequently favored Trump, liberal judges continue handing down injunctions to block his executive policies and orders.\n\nAdd to this an unprecedented degree of uncertainty about the 2026 midterm elections. More than 50 frustrated Senators and Congressmen, many of them Republicans, are choosing not to seek re-election. Most recent polling gives Democrats a 5-point advantage in the coming midterms, and the party occupying the White House historically loses 20 to 25 Congressional seats in the midterm terms.\n\nIf Democrats win back the House, another Trump impeachment is likely. The political landscape in 2027 and 2028 could become far more murky and less favorable to Trump than it is now.\n\nBut there is one way that Trump could do an end-around on all this and provide the nation a huge, maybe even transformational benefit in the process. Staying true to his roots and his campaign rhetoric dating back to 2015, Trump could announce in 2026 that he is now advocating for a convention of states under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, to adopt changes in how Washington works.\n\nSpecifically, he’d seek congressional term limits (something 87 percent of the public supports), a balanced budget amendment (something 49 of our 50 states already have), and limitations on the power of the judiciary.\n\nAll three of these are perfectly consistent with what Trump believes and has campaigned upon ever since he first tossed his hat into the presidential ring 11 years ago.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, Trump’s involvement could ensure success of the movement working toward holding such a convention of states. Under Article V, the legislatures of 34 states must pass resolutions in order to hold it. There are 20 states which have already agreed to the measure. Trump carried 31 states in the 2024 presidential election. Of these, 17 have not yet approved the resolution.\n\nIf Trump backs the measure and campaigns for an Article V convention, many of these 17 states would certainly get on board.\n\nTrump’s involvement would also ensure success due to one other factor: growing public disenchantment with the status quo. About 80 percent of Americans feel the nation is in a political crisis. The current upheaval over internal immigration enforcement and campaigning in the midterms will only serve to exacerbate that sentiment.\n\nThe best legacy Trump can leave America on its 250th anniversary is to reform the status quo once and for all. And the only way to achieve that is through the Convention of States process.\n\nJohn Kerezy is an associate professor at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland.",

    "fullText": "A law enforcement agency executing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has been described as a serial violator of court orders in Minnesota.\n\nThe declaration didn't come from the Democratic governor or Minneapolis' Democratic mayor, who have repeatedly traded barbs with President Donald Trump. It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "description": "Gold and silver plunged on Friday as traders reacted to Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed chair. The dollar jumped and the debasement trade took a hit.",
    "fullText": "The rally pushing gold and silver to new records finally stumbled on Friday as markets reacted to Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Reserve.\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed Governor, will replace Jerome Powell this year if confirmed by the Senate. The news sent metals tumbling on Friday as investors repriced their outlook for monetary policy and the so-called debasement trade that's helped gold'd record-setting rally took a hit.\n\nGold, which is still up more than 70% in the last year, dropped 7% to trade around $5,000 an ounce. It had briefly dipped below $5,000 before paring losses.\n\nSilver, which has roared more than 200% higher in the last year, plunged as much as 15% to trade around $99 an ounce.\n\nMarkets have been worried for months about Trump's Fed pick, as it was believed that Trump would plug in a new Fed chief to aggressively lower interest rates and help his big affordability push.\n\nThat's pushed down the value of the US dollar, one trend that's made precious metals more attractive over the past year.\n\nBut Warsh, who moved to the front of the line in Trump's Fed Chair search in recent weeks, is considered more hawkish and likely to preserve the Fed's independence.\n\nThat last point—that Trump could use his nominee to wrest control of the central bank—has been a big driver of the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and hurt the dollar over the last year.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which has declined 11% in 12 months, spiked shortly after Trump announced his Fed Chair pick on Truth Social, climbing 0.5% Friday morning.\n\nThe dollar's surge appeared to jump-start the sell-off in metals, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You knew there was going to be some trigger that would cause a bit of a technical pullback,\" he said, adding that investors were eager to take profits after the parabolic move in metals over the last 12 months.\n\nJosé Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, described the sell-off in metals as a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to Trump's Fed Chair pick. It's also natural for metals to pull back given the significant move to the upside in recent months, much of which was fueled by hype and speculation, he said.\n\n\"What President Trump wants is a dove. However, Warsh historically is an inflation hawk. I think there's a lot of confusion going on right now in terms of what kind of Warsh we're going to get at the Fed,\" he told Business Insider, pointing to the move in the dollar and precious metals.\n\n\"Okay, maybe the central bank is not going to be as loose as it might have been under perhaps Kevin Hassett,\" he added of the market's thinking.\n\nDavid Rosenberg, an economist and the founder of Rosenberg Research, noted that Warsh's nomination could have caused some investors to reverse course on the debasement trade, in which investors scoop up hard assets like gold and silver out of concern that the US dollar is at risk from macro forces including higher inflation, chaotic trade policy, and a politicized central bank.\n\n\"The market reaction so far points to 'less dovish' and more 'orthodox expectations, with independence fears easing at the margin. There is some unwinding in the so-called debasement trade,\" Rosenberg wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nHogan said it was too early to tell whether the debasement trade was truly unwinding, though the reaction on Friday suggested some investors were moving in that direction.\n\n\"It's understandable that you're going to get a pretty abrupt reaction when the pressures turn around,\" he said of the move, speculating that metals could drop further.",

A thin red belt cinched at the waist for a pop of color.\n\nThe dress felt high-fashion, connecting the first lady to her past as a model as she stepped into a new role.\n\nIn August 2017, the Trumps visited Corpus Christi, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey to assess recovery efforts.\n\nThe pair wore casual attire, with Melania arriving in a white button-down, black jeans, and sneakers. She also added a black baseball hat to her look that said \"FLOTUS,\" first lady of the United States, on the front.\n\nMelania's outfit quickly became a source of social-media chatter. Some said her hat called attention to her in the wake of the natural disaster, while others praised her casual outfit.\n\nWhen greeting Justin and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at the White House in October 2017, Melania wore a gray pinstripe suit instead of a dress.\n\nThe suit featured high-waisted pants, and she paired it with a white button-down and an untied black tie. The outfit was unexpected for a first lady, offering a fun style moment.\n\nMelania greeted President Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, in a black minidress and black pumps at the White House.\n\nThe standout feature of her outfit was a Givenchy tuxedo cape, which added a flair of personality to the otherwise simple look.\n\nThe first lady changed into a silver Chanel dress for the dinner.\n\nMost of the form-fitting dress was covered in textured fabric, while the top of the bodice and bottom of the skirt were made of a sheer, black fabric adorned with silver embellishments.\n\nThe fabrics didn't blend well, making the dress look too busy. It would have been a better look without the sheer fabric.\n\nIn June 2018, Melania visited an immigration facility in McAllen, Texas, where children were living, wearing a green Zara jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nCritics said the jacket was insensitive to wear for the visit, critiquing both the first lady and the president for the fashion faux pas.\n\nMelania's former aide, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" that the president yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though Trump and the first lady both said she wore it to send a message to the left-wing media.\n\nMelania wore a floor-length wrap dress from Ralph Lauren to celebrate Independence Day 2018.\n\nThe blue-and-white gingham dress was fun and festive for the holiday, but the oversize red belt tied at her waist overwhelmed the look.\n\nIf the first lady had swapped the bow for a thinner belt, her dress would have been more effective.\n\nMelania posed for photos in front of pyramids in Egypt wearing cream trousers, a white blouse, a black tie, and a sand-colored Ralph Lauren blazer. A white-and-black boater hat completed the look.\n\nThe outfit may have been innocuously stylish in a different venue, but some social-media users thought the outfit looked similar to one worn by \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" villain René Belloq during his visit to the pyramids in the film.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Melania faced criticism for one of her outfits on her visit to Africa. During her tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Melania told reporters, \"I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" following backlash for wearing a white pith helmet.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip,\" she added. \"We went to Ghana, we went to Malawi, we went to Kenya, here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip, not what I wear.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump arrived at the White House on the evening of December 27, holding hands as they walked across the lawn.\n\nWhile the president was in a suit, Melania wore a green jacket, light-brown pants, and matching shoes.\n\nThe pants might have been a better choice for a daytime look, as it was difficult for some to tell if the first lady was even wearing bottoms at first glance in the dark. The addition of sunglasses to her nighttime look was also an odd choice.\n\nMelania's outfit would have worked better during the day or with different pants.\n\nIn April 2019, the first lady was photographed at the White House in a black-and-white polka-dot dress designed by Alessandra Rich.\n\nThe high-neck dress was cinched at the waist with a black belt, coordinating with the dots on the dress, and it hit her mid-calf.\n\nMelania wore a cream coat over her shoulders and her signature sunglasses, adding glamour to the feminine look.\n\nDuring a visit to the UK, Melania attended a state dinner with the royal family in a Dior gown.\n\nA layer of semi-sheer fabric covered the gown's scooped neckline, forming points on the top of the bodice before transitioning into white fabric. The dress hugged her figure before flaring slightly at her waist.\n\nMelania wore white, elbow-length gloves with the dress. The look was fitting for dining with royalty.\n\nAhead of a dinner at Winfield House, where the American ambassador to the UK lives, Melania was photographed in a red Givenchy gown.\n\nMelania's floor-length dress was sleeveless and featured a built-in cape, a silhouette Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, often favors.\n\nDuring another visit to the UK in December 2019, Melania stepped out in a high-neck, cape coat from Valentino. The coat was mustard yellow, and Melania paired it with a pink dress and coordinating pumps.\n\nThe jacket was a big statement in and of itself, so the look would have been more effective if the first lady had worn a more neutral color with it than bright pink.\n\nMelania's black Dior sundress was fairly simple. The midi-length dress featured a V-neckline and a white, dotted pattern.\n\nThe white lace belt from Alaïa and white Christian Louboutin pumps she wore with the dress made the look cohesive, and she also added sunglasses to the outfit.\n\nThe look balanced Melania's personal style and traditional first lady attire.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump in a hot-pink midi-dress from Jason Wu at the 2020 RNC.\n\nThe dress featured a boat neckline and a flared skirt, and two black bows sat on the waistline, which appeared to be cinched with elastic. Melania wore black pumps with the dress.\n\nThe bows on the dress could have been chic, but they looked a bit crumpled throughout the night, particularly because they sat atop the ruched waistline and contrasted so heavily with the pink fabric. The dress would have been a better fit if there had been just one or no bows on the waistline.\n\nMelania wore a cape dress to close out the RNC, choosing a neon-green piece from Valentino.\n\nThe ankle-length, high-neck dress was covered in vertical pleats and featured two swaths of fabric flowing out from her shoulders like a cape. She added a thin pink belt and pink pumps to the outfit.\n\nThe silhouette was beautiful, but the green color was an odd choice for the RNC. Vanity Fair reported that it allowed social-media users to easily make memes out of the outfit using green screen technology.\n\nIf she had worn the dress in a different color, Melania's look would have been a slam dunk.\n\nMelania oversaw the delivery of the 2020 White House Christmas tree in a gingham coat from Balenciaga.\n\nThe loose-fitting coat featured an off-center line of buttons, and the collar formed a scarf that wrapped around one of Melania's shoulders. Quarter-length sleeves showed off the first lady's black gloves, just as the knee-length hem spotlighted her black boots from Alaïa.\n\nThe look was effortlessly chic.\n\nWhen Trump left office in January 2021, Melania chose to wear an all-black outfit.\n\nShe paired a form-fitting Dolce & Gabbana dress with a cropped Chanel coat, gloves, Christian Louboutin pumps, and dark sunglasses.\n\nThe look seemed to nod to Jackie Kennedy, just as her first outfit as first lady did. However, the darker hues spoke to the more somber tone of the day for the Trumps.\n\nMelania also made headlines for changing into a beachy dress before arriving at Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\n\nRather than wearing another pastel look to mark the beginning of her husband's second term as president, Melania donned navy and white for the 2025 inauguration.\n\nAdam Lippes designed her coat, which she paired with a white scarf, navy pumps, and a custom boater-style hat from Eric Javits. Boater hats are typically worn in summer, but the wool piece Melania wore offered a winter version.\n\nAlthough the hat got some negative attention online as people compared it to the one the Hamburglar or V in \"V For Vendetta\" wore, Melania's inaugural outfit was a savvy choice. The look set a serious tone, blending professional style with Melania's personal taste.\n\nMelania also managed to pull attention from Trump with the look, which was a feat considering how many eyes he had on him throughout the day.\n\nTraditionally, Easter fashion calls for pastel tones and festive prints like gingham, allowing people to have fun with their outfits.\n\nHowever, Melania arrived at the 2025 Easter Egg Roll at the White House in a simple cream trench coat from Mackage and heels designed by Roger Vivier.\n\nThe subdued look was a shift from Melania's more colorful outfits for previous Easter celebrations at the White House. Likewise, Mackage, a brand founded and headquartered in Canada, was a surprising choice for the first lady, given the ongoing trade dispute between the US and its northern neighbor.\n\nMelania joined her husband at Pope Francis' funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nShe wore a black coatdress designed by Dolce & Gabbana for the occasion, as well as lace gloves and a lace veil from the fashion house.\n\nWearing an Italian designer was fitting for the occasion since the Catholic Church is based in the country, though Melania also favors Dolce & Gabbana when she isn't in Italy.\n\nMelania chose a $3,900 Bottega Veneta dress for the show.\n\nThe dress had an asymmetrical neckline and gold detailing on the shoulder and waist. Melania paired the designer gown with silver and gold Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but Melania's black and white looks for Trump's second term are starting to feel a bit repetitive. A pop of color could have made the dress stand out more.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump at the US Army's 250th anniversary parade in Washington, DC, wearing another suit from Adam Lippes.\n\nBoth her $2,490 jacket and $1,190 skirt were cream-colored, with a subtle navy pinstripe pattern. The double-breasted jacket and pencil skirt had a looser, relaxed fit.\n\nBlue Christian Louboutin heels completed the ensemble.\n\nOn September 4, Melania attended a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education.\n\nShe wore a soft gray linen suit that featured white pinstripes. The jacket was oversized, and the pants were wide-legged. The first lady added structure to the look with a fitted white T-shirt and a white belt.\n\nStilettos completed the chic menswear look.\n\nOn September 16, the president and first lady arrived in the UK for a state visit. The following evening, they attended a state banquet with King Charles III, Queen Camilla, and other members of the royal family.\n\nMelania wore a bright yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera to the dinner. The dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, a column skirt, and a slit on the side. She added even more color to the ensemble with a wide, purple belt and bright green, dangly earrings.\n\nIt was nice to see Melania add some color to her wardrobe in 2025, but the bright hue and belt made the dress look a bit too casual for the event. The silhouette was pretty, but the first lady may have been better off wearing the gown in a more subdued color.\n\nOn September 23, Melania accompanied the president on a visit to the UN General Assembly, wearing a white blazer and tailored pants from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe suit was a strong choice, as the contrast of the long blazer and cropped pants felt professional and chic, and the cream Christian Louboutin shoes she paired with the look were stylish, too.\n\nHowever, the camel-colored blouse from Max Mara that she wore with the suit was almost too close to Melania's skin tone. The look would have popped more with a different colored shirt.\n\nWhen the president and first lady passed out candy at the White House on Halloween, neither opted to wear a costume. Instead, Melania donned a wool coat from Marni, which nodded to the holiday with orange trim on the collar, pockets, and lining.\n\nShe wore the khaki-colored coat buttoned to the collar, and it cinched at her waist with a thick belt — one of her go-to silhouettes. She paired the coat with taupe Manolo Blahnik heels.\n\nWhile the orange aspects of the look had a subtle Halloween feel, the outfit just didn't feel festive enough for the holiday, especially when compared to the plethora of decorations covering the White House for the event. Melania would have made a stronger statement in a full orange coat or a black and orange look.\n\nOn November 18, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, dined at the White House during his visit to the US.\n\nMelania donned a $3,350 Elie Saab dress for the occasion. The deep-green dress featured a strapless neckline, and ruching on both the bodice and the skirt added texture. A slit broke up the floor-length skirt, and Melania completed the look with black heels and sparkly earrings.\n\nEvery bit of Melania's look seemed designed to welcome Crown Prince Mohammed. The dress was similar in color to Saudi Arabia's national flag, seeming to nod to the nation. Plus, in November 2024, Elie Saab marked 45 years of his brand with \"1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,\" a massive fashion show held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMelania celebrated the end of 2025 at Trump's annual party at Mar-a-Lago wearing a sparkly, silver gown.\n\nDesigned by The New Arrivals, the $1,450 dress was sleeveless, with a scooped neckline, hugging Melania's figure as it flowed into a midi-length skirt. She paired the dress with bedazzled Christian Louboutin shoes and loose waves.\n\nThe look was festive and fitting for Florida weather, offering a refreshing change from her more subdued style.\n\nThe first lady attended the premiere of her documentary \"Melania\" in a Dolce & Gabbana skirt suit.\n\nBlack buttons lined the center of the jacket, which was cinched at Melania's waist with a black belt. The column skirt hid her mid-calf, spotlighting her black pumps.\n\nThe outfit might have been fine for any number of first lady engagements, but it felt too understated for the premiere of her film.\n\nA black gown with a professional flair may have been more appropriate for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "There was a surprising lack of \"MAGA red\" at the premiere of Melania Trump's new movie.\n\nThe first lady, her husband, and their political allies walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night to support the film, \"Melania,\" which hits theaters Friday.\n\nThere were no \"Make America Great Again\" hats or vibrant red suits in sight, though. Instead, attendees arrived in a mix of understated looks, American flag pins, and, most interestingly, blue ensembles.\n\nHere's a closer look at what attendees wore.\n\nDonald Trump posed outside the premiere in a navy suit, wearing an American flag pin on his lapel and a burgundy tie.\n\nMelania, on the other hand, chose an all-black ensemble from Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana. It comprised a straight skirt, a buttoned blazer with a thin belt, and pointed leather heels.\n\nThe outfit fit her subdued style, which she's worn throughout this presidential term. Her hair, now gold and brown, was styled in her signature waves.\n\nHe paired his pinstriped set with a white button-up shirt and an extra-skinny tie.\n\nThe latter was blue and printed with a pattern of small red crab shapes.\n\nDr. Oz and his son, Oliver, matched in blue satin suits, black dress shoes, and red ties.\n\nThe women of the family took the same approach, but with a different color palette. Lisa Oz wore a brown satin dress with gold heels and matching earrings, while Daphne Oz donned a glittering brown dress with velvet boots and a diamond necklace.\n\nHer $9,900 off-the-shoulder gown from Schiaparelli featured a floor-length skirt, all-over ruching, and a keyhole-shaped cutout down its bodice.\n\nShe wore it with dangling earrings and thick gold arm cuffs. The rapper's hair was styled in a sleek, straight look with bangs.\n\nPete Hegseth wore an ocean-blue suit with a white button-up shirt, a polka-dot tie, and brown leather dress shoes.\n\nHis wife, Jennifer, however, took a more glitzy approach. She wore a sequin-covered pantsuit with short sleeves, a V-neckline, and a black belt.\n\nShe wore the purple-and-blue ensemble with black heels and a matching clutch.\n\nThe current Secretary of Education was photographed at the movie premiere wearing a blue knee-length dress beneath a faux-fur white coat.\n\nShe also sported a silver necklace, diamond earrings, and navy loafers.",

    "fullText": "Flights to Venezuela are back on the cards for the first time in six years.\n\nNearly four weeks after the US launched military strikes in the country and captured Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump announced plans to airlines to resume flights to the country.\n\n\"We're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela and they'll be safe there.\"\n\nLate Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy rescinded a 2019 order that barred US airlines from flying to Venezuela, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration also said it had removed four notices to airmen in the Caribbean region, including one related to Venezuela.\n\n\"These NOTAMs were issued as precautionary measures and are no longer necessary,\" it said. \"Safety remains our top priority, and we look forward to facilitating the return of regular travel between the US and Venezuela.\"\n\nNearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled when the region's airspace was closed for 24 hours due to the military activity earlier this month. Some travelers spent thousands of dollars extra as they spent an extra week away from home.\n\nAmerican Airlines said on Thursday that it was \"proud to be the first airline to announce plans\" to reinstate flights to Venezuela.\n\nHowever, it could be some time before tickets are on sale.\n\nIn its announcement, American said it would share additional details \"in the coming months.\"\n\nIt added that it was working with federal authorities \"on all necessary permissions and security assessments prior to resuming service.\"\n\nAmerican first started serving Venezuela in 1987 and said it was the biggest operator there before suspending flights in 2019.\n\nThat year saw the country's political situation deteriorate as Venezuela's national assembly declared Maduro's reelection was invalid.\n\n\"We have a more than 30-year history connecting Venezolanos to the US, and we are ready to renew that incredible relationship,\" said Nat Pieper, American's chief commercial officer.\n\n\"By restarting service to Venezuela, American will offer customers the opportunity to reunite with families and create new business and commerce with the United States,\" he added.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.\n\nTrump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.”\n\n“Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.”\n\nThe threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year.\n\nJust hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trump threatened a 100% tariff on America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post.\n\nNo president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\n“Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said.\n\nBombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities, one of which, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it has announced plans to expand. It also said it has 2,800 US suppliers.\n\n“Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” said its statement. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.”\n\nTrump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft.\n\n“(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said.\n\nIf Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier makes the CRJ regional jets used on feeder flights, which typically take passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines that use CRJ on their feeder flights.\n\nBombardier also makes smaller commercial jets, the A220. But some of those A220 jets are made in the United States and some are made in Canada.\n\nSo far none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nThere are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day.\n\nGrounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data.\n\n“I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.”\n\nTaking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said.\n\n“It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.”\n\nIt’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FAA for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nCNN’s Pete Muntean contributed reporting.",

    "title": "How the weakest dollar in 4 years could undercut the relief everyday Americans get from Trump's affordability push",
    "description": "Trump said the US dollar is doing \"great,\" but a weaker currency could undercut his attempts to boost affordability for Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he's not in a rush to pump up America's sagging currency. Yet, that could be the very thing that comes back to bite his big affordability push, according to market pros, who say a weaker dollar could soon get in the way of the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs.\n\nTrump, who has made lowering borrowing costs a key goal of his second term, suggested he wasn't too pressed about the greenback's decline when speaking to reporters in Iowa this week.\n\n\"The dollar's doing great,\" Trump said, adding that he wanted the greenback to \"seek its own level\" — comments that sent the currency tumbling further to a four-year low.\n\nThe president has praised a weaker dollar before.\n\nLast year, he floated it as a positive, suggesting US firms could \"make a hell of a lot more money\" due to exports being more attractive broadly to foreign buyers.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, is down around 10% over the past year, thanks to pressures like some investors shifting away from dollar-based assets and the Fed continuing its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThere's just one problem: a weaker dollar doesn't bode well when it comes to making the case to lower interest rates. That's because a weaker currency lowers Americans' purchasing power abroad and could raise the cost of imported goods. Higher inflation could ultimately cause interest rates to rise — the opposite of what Trump is shooting for.\n\nJoe Kalish, a chief macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, said he believed the \"collapsing\" dollar could be Trump's \"Achilles' heel.\"\n\n\"If the new Fed Chair tries to push through a rate cut as soon as the June meeting, FX traders could smell blood in the water and punish the dollar, sending inflation expectations higher and worsening household affordability,\" Kalish wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that a soft dollar could result in a \"lose-lose\" situation when it came to lowering rates, even if Trump were to plug in a trusted ally as Fed Chair.\n\nA weaker dollar is also tied to the \"Sell America\" trade, the idea that investors are shifting away from US assets due to a worsening economic outlook. Investors dumping US bonds is part of that trade, something that would also cause yields to rise.\n\n\"The bond vigilantes would return and demand a higher term premium, forcing yields higher,\" Kalish added, referring to the potential for bond investors to stage a sell-off in government bonds as concerns rise over inflation, causing rates to rise in tandem.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, a key benchmark for other lending rates, was around 4.24% on Thursday, up two basis points this week. The move coincided with a 0.6 decline in the US Dollar Index over the same period.\n\nMore forecasters have been flagging the risk of higher yields due to a bond market revolt. Nela Richardson, the chief economist of ADP, said a weaker dollar could get in the way of the US's ability to sell Treasury bonds.\n\n\"A weak dollar at home doesn't always have the confidence of markets. And that confidence is going to be very important as we look at other things that are a struggle for the US economy, like sticky inflation, like high deficits and debts, and the need to sell treasuries,\" Richardson said.\n\nShe called a falling US dollar a \"double-edged sword\" when it came to Trump's economic agenda.\n\nRobert Kaplan, Goldman Sachs' vice chairman, also pointed out that a weak dollar would affect demand in the Treasury market.\n\n\"The United States has $39 trillion of debt on its way to $40 trillion plus,\" Kaplan said. \"I actually think the US is going to want to see a stable dollar and wants to see stability. And they want to be able to sell the long end of the Treasury curve. A stable dollar helps,\" he added.",

    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

    "description": "Trump's admin posted its proposed rule to overhaul student-loan repayment, including new caps on borrowing. The public will have 30 days to comment.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has insisted he’s a “kind” and “gentle” person while in the same breath blasting one of his very own appointees as a “moron.”\n\nThe president’s comments came as part of a confused and rambling Truth Social tirade posted early Thursday morning. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell again refused to cut interest rates, even though he has absolutely no reason to keep them so high,” Trump began.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly lambasted Powell, who he appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018, for refusing to follow White House instructions on interest rates. Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "The secretary acknowledged that the president misspoke, despite claims from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that President Donald Trump had previously misspoken while defending his campaign to acquire Greenland — and critics are pouncing.\n\nWhile testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions for the first time since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela led to the capturing of leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife. He said that the former regime represented an “untenable situation,” telling lawmakers that the United States does not intend nor expect to take any further military action “at this time.”\n\nAt one point, Rubio was asked a question by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) about the president’s desire to acquire Greenland, which was renewed in the days following the raid. Kaine pointed to an instance last week when Trump said Iceland instead of Greenland four times while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy, right? Last time,” Trump said, referencing a previous nickname from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nAbout a minute later, Trump claimed that “they are not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you.”\n\n“I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”\n\nDuring the hearing, Kaine asked Rubio directly: “The president repeatedly mistook Iceland for Greenland, right? We’re not mad at Iceland... the president just mistook the two countries for each other, correct?”\n\n“Yeah, he meant to say Greenland, but I think we’re all familiar with presidents that have verbal stumbles,” Rubio said, appearing to take a jab at former President Joe Biden. “We’ve had presidents like that before. Some made a lot more than this one.”\n\nAfter some reporters and critics noted the president’s mistake, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly hopped on the defense, responding to NewsNation’s Libbey Dean, who posted on X that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”\n\n“No he didn’t, [Libbey],” Leavitt replied. “His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here.”\n\nLeavitt’s post has since been marked with a community note, with X users claiming that she is “not telling the truth.”\n\nA number of Trump’s critics quickly pummeled Leavitt following the exchange with Rubio.\n\n“Rubio calls Karoline Leavitt a liar,” the progressive network MeidasTouch wrote in response, though Rubio did not use the label directly.\n\n“So the Press Secretary wasn’t on the level here?” another user asked. “Shocking.”\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Fred Wellman added: “Swing and a miss, Marco! Better luck next time.”\n\nTrump told reporters last week that he would announce details of a compromise in “two weeks” related to the future of Greenland, which falls under the boundaries of Denmark, a NATO ally. His deadline came one day after he announced a “framework of a deal” with the NATO alliance, without providing any details.\n\nTrump called a potential proposal “infinite,” adding that it will be “a deal that’s forever.”\n\nRubio said during Wednesday’s hearing that “we’re in a good place right now” with Greenland. He noted that there is a “professional” process underway that will result in a “good outcome for everybody.”\n\nTrump has faced fierce resistance from officials in both Greenland and Denmark, who have argued that the semi-autonomous Arctic territory is not for sale. The president, however, has frequently maintained that ownership over the island, home to critical rare earth minerals, is necessary for national security, while warning against Russia or China occupying it in the future.\n\nIn his announcement of a “framework,” Trump also pointed to his proposed “Golden Dome,” a missile defense system that he has previously teased will be operating before the end of his term in 2029.\n\n“Because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's $1,000 to \"Trump Accounts\" for employees' kids.\n\nThe banks each employ more than 160,000 employees in the US.\n\n\"Trump accounts\" are Treasury-funded accounts that give $1,000 to newborn Americans.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "fullText": "Under Donald Trump, the White House has filled its social media with memes, wishcasting, nostalgia and deepfakes. Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trolling\n\nIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.\n\nThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.\n\nThe image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, held up the image at a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social in October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”\n\nOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became a sensation in March 2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).\n\nThe White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.\n\nFor Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”\n\nThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.\n\nPredictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and was met with outrage from Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”\n\nAs so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”\n\nTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digital Trump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.\n\nIn 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body of Superman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroically striding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.\n\nWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.\n\nThe image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . The Trump administration then doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.\n\nFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White House posted an AI video of a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.\n\nEven if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According to one paper by the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.\n\nAgain, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.\n\nThe slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.\n\n“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”\n\nIn August, the Department of Homeland Security posted a mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).\n\n“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters, 80s action-movie posters or 1950s public information campaigns (as with a recent image of Trump as a friendly milkman).\n\nAI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist, Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.\n\n“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.\n\nHalf an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.\n\nUntil this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.\n\nAs with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.\n\nThe fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”\n\nAfter the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”\n\nTo those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country's threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday's event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt's unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county's chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn't been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar's safety has been an issue for years. After Trump's initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.\n\nBiesecker and Brown reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Donald Trump blasts mind-boggling Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub",

    "description": "Trump's pick to replace Powell could add a layer of uncertainty to how traders have been navigating bets on Fed rate decisions.",
    "fullText": "Bettors on prediction markets love wagering on Fed decisions.\n\nIn a post on its blog, Polymarket said that Fed moves are a favorite bet for a certain kind of trader, and they've identified a framework for how they're navigating the market.\n\nPolymarket's internal data shows that the moment when the odds around a Fed decision \"crystallize\"—defined as the leading odds becoming dominant and ceasing to flip—actually sets in weeks before the meeting. This probably is not surprising, as futures markets tend to broadcast the Fed rate-cut odds for weeks or even months before the next meeting.\n\nStill, Polymarket's blog shows how certain kinds of bets known as \"bonds,\" which are high-probability bets that rarely flip, are approached by bettors.\n\n\"Across 22 Fed decisions from March 2023 to December 2025, I find that Polymarket odds crystallize with a median of ~26 days before the Fed meeting, which is early enough to create tradable entry points,\" the author of the post writes.\n\n\"Crystallization\" is defined by one outcome pulling ahead with at least 80% odds and remaining stable for several days in a row without any major swings.\n\nThe post also notes that, in most cases, odds of a rate decision settle early, as the central bank typically chooses between keeping rates unchanged or adjusting them by 25bp. However, recently, the US economy has faced a lot more uncertainty around the economy and the path of interest rates.\n\n\"Each new data release can completely reverse market expectations, preventing odds from stabilizing,\" the post said. \"Prospectively, traders can identify regime shifts by reading more on Fed communications signaling framework uncertainty or monitoring elevated VIX for a continuous period.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlights the key lead-lag relationship between institutional markets, which adjust to monetary speculation almost immediately, and prediction markets, which typically react roughly a day and a half later.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket aren't uncovering new information. Rather they are mirroring moves already priced in by other markets, creating small windows where Polymarket odds have not caught up to the broader market.\n\n\"It is worth noting that traders should view this on a relative-value basis rather than solely believing one is correct while the other is wrong as odds could flip quickly with new emerging data.\"\n\nThe author noted, though, that there is a potential wildcard for traders to consider going forward. Trump is set to replace Powell as Fed chair this year, and when he does, the central bank's new leader could abandon the forward-guidance policy, a key component of Polymarket's trading strategy.\n\nLee acknowledged that such a scenario would mark the type of regime shift that would be a test of the framework he outlined for navigating Fed policy moves.",

There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n\nBelichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.\n\nHowever, Brady said he was \"not worried\" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe added: \"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives.\"",

    "description": "The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong’s arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis.\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,” he said. “By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,” or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they’re seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can’t tell if what they’re watching is fake, and questions whether they would know “what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.”\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "fullText": "The UK is the country with no bloc.\n\nAt Davos, Britain refused to join Trump's Board of Peace, citing commitment to international law and rejection of the \"pay-to-play\" model. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway made the same choice. The difference is that those countries have somewhere else to go. Britain doesn't.\n\nThe SAFE instrument, the EU's €150 billion fund for joint defense procurement, is designed explicitly for strategic autonomy. Strict \"Buy European\" provisions limit non-EU subcontractors to 15-35% of contract value, phased out within two years. Canada, remarkably, negotiated access and now has preferential treatment on par with EU firms. The UK remains excluded.\n\nTalks broke down in late 2025. The EU's requirements for third-country participation, London viewed as an infringement on sovereignty. The same sovereignty concerns that drove Brexit now lock Britain out of the emerging European defense architecture. The \"mid-Atlantic bridge\" was always a metaphor. Britain positioned itself as the hinge between American power and European integration, useful to both, dependent on neither. That positioning assumed both poles wanted a bridge. Now the US treats allies as protection rackets and the EU is building walls around its defense industrial base. The bridge has nowhere to land.\n\nWhat does the Starmer government do? The choices were supposed to be theoretical. Align with Washington and accept the transactional terms of the Donroe Doctrine. Align with Brussels and accept the sovereignty constraints of SAFE participation. Or go it alone, with a defense budget that can't sustain independent capability against peer competitors.\n\nThe IISS analysis of SAFE's implications for non-EU suppliers is blunt: firms outside the bloc face structural disadvantages that compound over time. Procurement cycles last decades. If British defense firms are locked out of European contracts now, the gap widens with each passing year. The industrial base erodes.\n\n\"Global Britain\" was the slogan after Brexit, a vision of nimble bilateral relationships unconstrained by Brussels bureaucracy. The reality is that global influence requires either hard power or bloc membership. Britain has neither the military budget for the former nor the political will for the latter.\n\nCanada's pivot is instructive. Facing similar pressure from Washington, Carney diversified, joining SAFE, negotiating with Beijing, building horizontal coalitions with other middle powers. Britain has done none of this. It refused the Board of Peace on principle but hasn't found an alternative structure to join on pragmatism.\n\nPrinciples without alternatives is just isolation. The UK is learning what it means to be a middle power without a coalition, morally opposed to the new American order but structurally excluded from the European one.",

    "description": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's one-time contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts.\"",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell partnered with the Trump Accounts initiative and committed to contributing $250 to the accounts of 25 million American children, totaling a $6.25 billion donation from their charitable fund. Children aged 10 and younger who were born before January 1, 2025, and live in a ZIP code with a median income of $150,000 or less are eligible for the money. \n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, also announced plans to donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut living in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less.",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion. Both fourth quarter and full-year revenues were up 12% against the previous year.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "description": "The Dispatch published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his \"enablers\" in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "The Dispatch, a conservative publication founded by former Fox News contributors Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes, published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his “enablers” in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the headline “The Cost of Silence,” The Dispatch‘s editors described a dismal state of affairs, pointing to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, the manufactured crisis over Greenland, Canada’s cozying up to China, continued economic uncertainty, and the criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as examples of the chaos invited by the Trump administration.\n\n“One of the ironies repeated throughout world political history is that autocrats rarely bring the order they are elected—or installed—to deliver, even the servile kind that can be imposed through state terror. No, more reliably, autocrats bring disorder,” they argued. “The disorder under which Americans are now suffering, the ramifications of which have only just begun to be realized, is what inevitably happens when an American president disregards the rule of law, insisting that he is limited only by his own sense of morality—a sense of morality that in this case does not quite seem to exist.”\n\nWe are aware that Dispatch readers have read and heard us repeat these points a thousand times in articles and on podcasts, and we are equally aware that a Dispatch editorial, while rare, is not going to be the “J’accuse!” that forces the powers that be to rethink where they are and what has brought them there. But we will repeat ourselves nonetheless: Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified for the office of the presidency, himself a man with no sense of integrity or administrative acumen, and one who is lazy, vain, ignorant, and vulnerable to flattery — all of which make him easy to manipulate for figures such as Stephen Miller, whose ethnonationalist obsessions and sophomoric Nietzschean posturing have dominated the administration’s agenda for months and who is emblematic of the types of advisers with whom the president has surrounded himself this second go-round.\n\n“But Trump is far from the only one at fault for the mess in which we find ourselves,” submitted The Dispatch, turning its attention briefly to former President Joe Biden, and then congressional Republicans.\n\n“When the history of our time is written, congressional leaders—particularly Republican congressional leaders—will be remembered as more important, and much more culpable, than it seems at this moment. Describing their careers as inaction would be too charitable; they have been enablers not only of the particular crimes of the Trump administration but of the more general aggrandizement of the presidency and the subordination of the entire legislative branch—the branch created by Article I of our Constitution to make laws and exercise oversight of federal agencies,” it argued. “They are, in a very real sense, in gross violation of their oaths of office, and so too are the representatives and senators of both parties who have contributed over the years to the reduction of Congress to its current miserable state.”\n\nAfter posing a hard-hitting question to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) — “If you cannot act in the face of this—all this — why do you choose to remain in the Senate at all?” — the editorial concluded thusly:\n\nDante put his cowards and opportunists — those who refused to take a stand in life — in the vestibule of his inferno: It isn’t Hell proper, but you can see the rest of the underworld from there. The cowards and opportunists in the United States in 2026 stand at a precipice, too, and have brought our country to the verge of something awful and unspeakable. We got here one step at a time — let us hope that we remember the way back.\n\nThe post The Dispatch Warns Trump and GOP Have ‘Brought Our Country to the Verge of Something Awful and Unspeakable’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Business leaders who believe staying quiet about the Trump administration will protect their companies are making a dangerous miscalculation, says Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and tech investor said in an episode of the \"Rapid Response\" podcast published Tuesday that he rejects the idea that executives can simply wait out political turbulence.\n\n\"The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won't be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is a longtime Democratic donor and one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken political voices. He has backed Democratic candidates and causes for years and has publicly clashed with pro-Trump business leaders, including the White House AI czar, David Sacks.\n\nIn 2024, Hoffman contributed $2 million to a super PAC that spearheaded a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.\n\nHoffman said fear of retaliation from the Trump administration has made many business leaders hesitant to speak publicly, but fear is exactly the wrong guide. Executives should speak out instead of rationalizing that \"it's the right thing for my business,\" he added.\n\nHoffman framed public engagement as a responsibility that comes with wealth and power.\n\n\"Human beings first,\" he said. \"Humanity, society, right, you are members of both of those.\"\n\n\"Anyone who's wealthy in the society should be extremely grateful for being part of the society. You have responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nHoffman said he is \"regularly called out by the White House\" and added that it should not be punitive for leaders to speak based on their knowledge and experience.\n\n\"Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be speaking up, and we need to be figuring out how to solve our problems together,\" he added.\n\nHoffman's comments come as some business and tech leaders have broken their silence over the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the broader immigration crackdown under the Trump administration.\n\nPretti's death — the second killing by federal officers within weeks — has drawn sharp public debate over federal enforcement tactics and accountability.\n\nSome business and tech leaders reacted strongly. Google DeepMind's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote in response to a video of the shooting on X that \"this is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nOthers have joined in, including former Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. LeCun bluntly labelled the footage of the shooting \"Murderers.\"\n\nA group of more than 60 Minnesota-based CEOs signed a letter on Sunday urging \"de-escalation\" and collaboration among state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\nOther CEOs have remained quiet on the issue. Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote Tuesday that business leaders have several reasons for staying silent, including concern that the Trump administration has made it clear it is willing to pressure or punish companies that don't bend to its will.",

    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is sharing his concerns about the “media morons” he claims are distorting the truth about American safety.\n\nBongino, who stepped down from his position earlier this month after serving in his role for less than a year, went on a tangent about the media while being interviewed by Fox News on Thursday, accusing the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nThe topic came up while discussing a recent report from Axios, claiming that according to the Council on Criminal Justice, the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900.\n\nHowever, Fox News claimed that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade low during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these (expletive).”\n\nBongino then cited a New York Times article, which included interviews with several current and former employees who accused Director of the FBI Kash Patel of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge. Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country,\" Bongino said.\n\nBongino said the media is a “big, full diaper,” adding that he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity then commented by saying that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” observing he was more restrained when he held a government title.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”\n\nSuffolk DA on Minneapolis: ICE’s, Border Patrol’s tactics ‘threaten citizens everywhere’\n\n‘Nasty profession’: Trump reveals why he skewers people in public he thinks are ‘nice’\n\nTrump calls vocal critic ‘incompetent’ as 2028 presidential race heats up\n\nMass.

    "description": "Brittney Griner considers the Trump administration's ongoing ICE-led deportations and arrests a \"crime against humanity.\"",
    "fullText": "WNBA star Brittney Griner considers the Trump administration’s ongoing, increasingly aggressive ICE-led deportations, arrests and overall immigration strategy a “crime against humanity.”\n\nThe WNBA champion and three-time Olympic gold medalist stars in director Alex Stapleton’s new documentary “The Brittney Griner Story.” The doc, which premieres Tuesday at Sundance, recounts Griner’s early 2022 arrest by Russian customs officials for accidentally bringing a cannabis vape cartridge into the country and the 10 months she spent detained in a Russian prison, as well as the global efforts that were undertaken to ensure her release.\n\nThe film’s festival debut comes just a little over three years after Griner was released in Dec. 2022 from a Russian penal colony in a prisoner exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. It is also premiering at a time when concerns about ICE’s detainment practices in America are at an all-time high.\n\nAs protests continue on the wintery, frozen streets of Minnesota, where two Minneapolis residents have already been shot and killed during tense encounters with ICE and Border Patrol agents, Griner was asked about the turmoil and shared her thoughts on the subject in a Sundance conversation with TheWrap’s executive editor Adam Chitwood.\n\n“At the end of the day, it just comes down to just being a good person,” Griner told TheWrap. “We are taking children. There’s facilities where it’s nothing but kids. You can hear them screaming and yelling when people go to try to get access to it, people that have never even been in these countries [they’re trying to send them to], and they’re getting deported into these horrible situations. It’s really sad.”\n\n“This is something that I didn’t think that I would ever see in my own country,” Griner added. “I traveled abroad. I’ve been to a lot of different places. I’ve been detained. I never thought that this would be my reality in my own country, where it should not be the case. And then to justify the things and lie. It’s sad.”\n\nIt is partly because of the current unrest in America that Stapleton, for her part, believes now is the right time for “The Brittney Griner Story” to be released to audiences. “I feel like it is God’s timing for this story, for her story, to come out,” Stapleton told TheWrap. “Because now more than ever, people need to understand the blurred lines between what an authoritarian regime will do.”\n\n“I think we need to understand how important it is to fight for our freedom,” Stapleton explained. “It’s important now more than ever, I think, for people to be in rooms like this, at festivals like this, to be in community, in real life, so that we understand that we are all humans, and that some of the evil that’s coming off of social media, it’s actually a very small group. I think that most of us believe in the power of good and the power of humanity, and so I hope that this film touches on some of those themes and gets people talking.”\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 25 years,” Stapleton added, reflecting on the timing of this year’s Sundance Film Festival and the situation she and other filmmakers have found themselves in. “I think we feel guilty that we’re not out on the streets protesting, and we’ve all had to tell ourselves that our work is our protest.”\n\nThe post Brittney Griner Calls ICE Minnesota Killing, Deportations ‘Crimes Against Humanity’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "The tech powering ICE's deportation crackdown",
    "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to phone unlocking technology and databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nA year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.\n\nICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nHere are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.\n\nICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.\n\nCell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.\n\nIn the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.\n\nA contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”\n\nTOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”\n\nCell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.\n\nThese devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nAuthorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nIn mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.\n\nThis contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.\n\nMagnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.\n\nMagnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.\n\nThe tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.\n\nThe redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”\n\nThis type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.\n\nOnce collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.\n\nThe other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.\n\nForbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.\n\nPenlink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.\n\nICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.\n\nEfforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.\n\nBorder Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to \n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.\n\nFirst published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.",

    "description": "Vindman, a retired lieutenant colonel now challenging Republican Ashley Moody, testified before Congress about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI — Democrat Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who helped trigger President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, announced his Senate campaign in Florida on Tuesday to challenge GOP Sen. Ashley Moody.\n\nVindman’s entrance into the race pulls Trump’s agenda and record to the forefront of the Senate contest in Florida, bringing a national focus to a race in the president’s home state — one now widely seen as Republican-leaning. Democrats have a narrow path to wrest control of the Senate in November, in which they’d have to keep all the seats they currently hold and flip four others.\n\nVindman, born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, was an aide on the NSC during Trump’s first term. He testified before Congress about Trump’s 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the president floated an investigation of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump appeared to tie future U.S. aid to Ukraine’s willingness to launch and announce a probe that would be damaging to Biden.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in that case, and Vindman, an Army combat veteran and lieutenant colonel, was fired from his position with the NSC. Vindman went on to become a vocal Trump critic, published two books and worked as a senior adviser for VoteVets, which helps to elect veterans to public office. He first floated a run for Senate in May 2025 on CBS Miami. He said at the time that he thought the 2026 midterms would be a referendum on Trump.\n\nVindman leans into his run-in with Trump in a campaign video launched Tuesday morning. “This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family, but against all of us,” he said in the two-minute video. “Today, our country is in chaos.”\n\nThe Senate seat in Florida is up in a special election this year, and whoever wins will have to run again in 2028. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Moody, a former state attorney general, to the Senate when Marco Rubio became Trump’s secretary of State.\n\nMoody has to run for the seat for the first time in November, and appointed senators have a history of faring less well than those who were elected. But Moody already received Trump’s endorsement and is battle-tested statewide, having won her state attorney general races twice, both times by higher margins than DeSantis’ gubernatorial wins.\n\nAny statewide Democratic candidate faces an uphill climb in Florida, given that Republican voters in the state outnumber Democratic voters by around 1.4 million people. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report also classified the Senate seat in Florida as being in the “Solid R” category — the most GOP-friendly ranking available.\n\nMoody, who comes from a prominent legal family and isn’t facing a serious GOP challenger, has Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio on her campaign team. And former Trump campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita has a key role in a super PAC supporting her election.\n\nVindman’s campaign video draws attention to affordability issues that appeared to have had an impact in the better-than-expected showing Democrats had in 2025 races. He also brought attention to higher Obamacare premiums that kicked in this year. Moody — along with most Senate Republicans — didn’t support extending enhanced subsidies for premiums, a decision GOP pollsters previously warned would be unpopular.\n\nIn his campaign video, Vindman accused Moody of having been tapped to the Senate to “be a ‘yes’ vote for Trump and the billionaires.”\n\n“She’s not Florida’s senator,” says Vindman’s narration in the campaign video. “She’s theirs.”\n\nVindman, who lives in Democratic stronghold Broward County, enters an increasingly crowded Democratic primary that includes former Brevard County school board member Jennifer Jenkins; progressive state Rep. Angie Nixon; and Hector Mujica, a Venezuelan-American candidate who previously was head of philanthropy at Google for the Americas.\n\nPolitics are also in Vindman's family. His twin brother, Eugene Vindman, was elected to represent Virginia in Congress in 2024, in the seat formerly held by now-Gov. Abigail Spanberger.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong's arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,\" he said. \"By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,\" or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they're seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can't tell if what they're watching is fake, and questions whether they would know \"what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.\"\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "fullText": "Campaigners decry ties with ‘Trump-supporting’ tech firms after funding is accepted to develop state AI systems\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nMinisters have accepted $1m (£728,000) from Meta, the US tech and social media company, to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport, sparking warnings about the UK government’s “alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants”.\n\nThe money from Mark Zuckerberg’s company will be used to pay experts to “develop cutting-edge AI solutions … to support national security and defence teams”, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe money will pay for four British AI experts, coordinated by the government-funded Alan Turing Institute, to “play a pivotal role in rewiring our healthcare, police, transport systems and more”, said Ian Murray, the minister for data and digital government.\n\nThe move comes after Meta executives had 50 meetings with ministers in the last two years for which data was available, one of the highest levels of direct access of any technology company, a Guardian investigation found.\n\nThe government is consulting on a ban on social media use by under-16s, which would have a major effect on Meta’s Instagram platform. Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.\n\nAnnouncing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.\n\nDSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”\n\nBut the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\n“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”\n\nDaisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.\n\nShe added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”\n\nThe government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.\n\nDSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak was taking an advisory role at the $350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.\n\nThe deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”\n\nThe Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.",

    "description": "The president believes this one project will hurt the Democrat's floated presidential chances.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump had some harsh thoughts on a potential 2028 run for the White House from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\n\nDuring an interview with the California Post, which launched on Monday, Trump blasted Newsom’s leadership in the Golden State as “incompetent” as he weighed in on the possibility that the governor could launch a bid in the next presidential election.\n\n“I’m amazed Gavin wants to run for office,” Trump said of one of his biggest critics during an interview in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nTrump argued that California needs “proper leadership,” claiming that Newsom hasn’t delivered since he began leading the state in 2019.\n\n“People love the dream of California, but they hate what’s happening to them,” Trump said, describing the Democratic governor as “incompetent.”\n\nNewsom has yet to formally announce a run for office, but has dominated as a top contender in several early polls, which have also floated former Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, among others.\n\nTrump has previously suggested Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a possible Republican ticket.\n\nIn the interview, Trump went on to predict that California’s high-speed rail project, expected to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, will negatively impact Newsom’s chances on the campaign trail.\n\nFederal funding for the proposal came to a stop this month, while the project remained behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, according to KMPH-TV. It was estimated to cost up to $128 billion — almost four times the original $33 billion price tag — while a report from the U.S. Transportation Department said it was unlikely to reach a complete target for its initial segment by 2033.\n\nThe halt came as California dismissed its lawsuit in December that challenged the termination of $4 billion in Obama- and Biden-era federal grants, which the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to withdraw. Meanwhile, the House passed an appropriations bill last week that included a provision making the project ineligible for federal funding.\n\n“He has the train, the train to nowhere, that was supposed to be a simple train that went from San Francisco to Los Angeles,” Trump said, adding that “It’s the greatest cost runover that I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThe president noted that he could have built “that thing in one year.”\n\nTrump also said his relationship with Newsom has become “hopeless” from once friendly during his first term.\n\n“They’ve gone radical left,” Trump said. “They’re crazy.”\n\nTrump made a similar claim while he addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Newsom was in attendance, last week.\n\n“We’re going to help the people in California,” Trump said. “We want to have no crime.”\n\n“I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin’s a good guy,” he continued, saying that he would help Newsom “in a heartbeat.”\n\nTrump confirmed to the Post that they both privately spoke, but declined to give details of the conversation.\n\n“I spoke to him fine,” he said.",

    "title": "13 times Melania Trump broke with White House tradition and defied expectations as first lady",
    "description": "Melania Trump has made the first lady role her own by straying from presidential protocol and long-held White House traditions.",
    "fullText": "First ladies often act as representatives of their husbands' campaigns, traveling the country to deliver speeches and meet voters at events. During all of Trump's presidential campaigns, Melania was noticeably absent, making only occasional appearances.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2023 that while Melania Trump privately supported Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, she rejected his offers to campaign with him.\n\nWhen asked about Melania Trump's absence, Donald Trump told \"Meet the Press\" in 2023 that he likes to keep her away from the campaign trail because \"it's so nasty and so mean.\"\n\n\"She's a private person, a great person, a very confident person, and she loves our country very much,\" he said of his wife.\n\nWhile Donald Trump moved into the White House after the inauguration, he told reporters that Melania Trump stayed behind in New York with their then-10-year-old son, Barron Trump, so that he could finish out the school year.\n\nWashington Post reporter Mary Jordan wrote in her book, \"The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,\" that Melania Trump also used the time to renegotiate her prenuptial agreement.\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that one of Donald Trump's lawyers, Michael Cohen, transferred a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from speaking about their alleged 2006 affair.\n\nAfter reports emerged of Donald Trump's alleged affair, which he denied, Melania Trump backed out of a trip to Switzerland and other public engagements. She also arrived at the 2018 State of the Union address in a separate motorcade in a break from the tradition of presidents and their spouses arriving together.\n\nMelania Trump's then-director of communications, Stephanie Grisham, said that the first lady did not travel with her husband because she was accompanying the guests of honor, the BBC reported.\n\nDonald Trump was later found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment to Daniels. After the hush-money trial reached its verdict in May, Donald Trump continued to deny the affair and called the trial a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nAfter The New Yorker published a report detailing a former Playmate's alleged affair with Donald Trump, which he denied took place, Melania Trump once again did not appear publicly by her husband's side.\n\nInstead of taking the traditional walk with Donald Trump across the White House lawn, she arrived at the presidential helicopter in a separate vehicle.\n\n\"With her schedule, it was easier to meet him on the plane,\" Grisham told CNN of Melania Trump's separate route.\n\nFor her first Christmas in the White House in 2017, Melania Trump lined the East Colonnade with bare white branches that cast shadows on the hall. In 2018, she filled the East Colonnade with dark-red trees that garnered comparisons to costumes in the dystopian TV series \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" The following year, clear acrylic panels lined the hall, and her final White House Christmas featured potted plants.\n\nHer avant-garde Christmas decorations garnered some criticism, while others praised her unconventional choices.\n\n\"Everyone has a different taste,\" Melania Trump said of the critical responses to her Christmas decorations at a town hall event hosted by Liberty University in 2018.\n\nIn a speech at the First Baptist Church in Dallas in 2021, Donald Trump said that Melania Trump \"didn't get exactly a fair shake\" when it came to her Christmas decor choices.\n\n\"She would make the most beautiful Christmas decorations,\" he said. \"And I remember she made these magnificent red trees, and the media said, 'Oh, that's terrible.'\"\n\nThroughout US history, first ladies have chosen outfits with deeper meanings that reflect their values. Laura Bush wore red to help bring awareness to the dangers of heart disease. Michelle Obama chose to highlight up-and-coming designers from underrepresented backgrounds. Jill Biden appeared at campaign events wearing boots emblazoned with the word \"vote.\"\n\nMelania Trump's \"I really don't care, do u?\" jacket, worn while traveling to visit immigrant children at the US-Mexico border in 2018, seemed an unusually combative wardrobe choice for a first lady.\n\nMelania Trump wrote in her 2024 memoir that her press secretary wouldn't let her clarify that the jacket's message was directed at the media.\n\n\"The media claimed the jacket meant I did not care about the children or the border, which was clearly not true,\" she wrote.\n\nMelania Trump delivered speeches at the 2016 and 2020 conventions. In 2024, she only attended the final day of the Republican National Convention and did not speak.\n\nDonald Trump accepted Joe Biden's invitation to meet at the White House as part of Joe Biden's pledge to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. However, Melania Trump, who released her memoir, \"Melania,\" in October 2024, turned down the first lady's offer to meet for tea, citing a scheduling conflict with her book tour.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump will not be attending today's meeting at the White House,\" Melania Trump's office wrote in a statement on X.\n\n\"Her husband's return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success. In this instance, several unnamed sources in the media continue to provide false, misleading, and inaccurate information. Be discerning with your source of news.\"\n\nIn November 2024, CNN reported that Melania Trump was \"unlikely\" to move into the White House full time.\n\nA week before the inauguration in January 2025, when asked by Ainsley Earhardt of Fox News about her plans, Melania Trump said she would primarily live at the White House, but would also divide her time between Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"I will be in the White House,\" she said. \"And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\"\n\nShe added that her \"first priority\" was to be a mom, first lady, and wife and to \"serve the country.\"\n\nSince taking office, Melania Trump has made appearances at official events, but has largely kept a low profile.\n\nMelania Trump was more involved in the redecoration of the White House during Donald Trump's first term. Her projects then included adding a new Tennis Pavilion, reupholstering the Red Room, and revamping the Rose Garden.\n\nThis time around, Donald Trump has been redesigning the White House according to his tastes by mounting numerous gold furnishings in the Oval Office, adding portraits of himself to the Entrance Hall, and paving a stone terrace in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn October, he oversaw his largest renovation yet: the demolition of the East Wing, which had previously housed the Office of the First Lady, to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot state ballroom.\n\nFirst ladies have historically waited to release books, documentaries, and other media about their experiences in the role until after their time in the White House has concluded.\n\nIn recent years, Michelle Obama published her bestselling memoir \"Becoming\" in 2018, a year after President Barack Obama left office in 2017, followed by a Netflix documentary of the same name in 2020. Laura Bush published her memoir, \"Spoken from the Heart,\" in 2010, a year after President George W. Bush left office.\n\nMelania Trump released her White House memoir, \"Melania,\" in October 2024, weeks before the presidential election. Her documentary of the same name was filmed in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's inauguration and premieres on January 30.\n\nThe first lady hosted an early private screening at the White House on Saturday attended by CEOs, including Tim Cook of Apple, Eric Yuan of Zoom, and Andy Jassy of Amazon. Amazon paid a reported $40 million to license the documentary.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in November 2024. It was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "fullText": "Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has signalled to Ukraine that U.S. security guarantees depend on Kyiv agreeing to a peace deal likely requiring ​it to cede the Donbas region to Russia, the Financial Times reported ‌on Tuesday, citing eight people familiar with the talks.\n\nWashington has also indicated it could offer Ukraine more weapons ‌to strengthen its peacetime army if Kyiv agreed to withdraw forces from the parts of the eastern region it controls, the newspaper said.\n\nThe United States is not trying to force any territorial concessions upon Ukraine, a source familiar ⁠with the matter said.\n\nThe U.S. ‌has said that security guarantees depend on both sides agreeing to a peace deal, but the contents of the peace deal are ‍up to Russia and Ukraine, the source added.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that a U.S. document on security guarantees for Ukraine was \"100% ready\" and Kyiv is now awaiting a ​time and place for it to be signed.\n\nZelenskiy has consistently said that Ukraine's ‌territorial integrity must be upheld in any peace deal to end the war.\n\nUkraine is increasingly uncertain whether Washington will commit to security guarantees, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times, saying the U.S. \"stops each time the security guarantees can be signed.\"\n\nKyiv wants the guarantees confirmed before conceding any territory.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - American composer Philip Glass withdrew the world premiere of his symphony \"Lincoln\" from the Kennedy Center on Monday, ​saying the work's values conflict with those of the performing ‌arts venue that was taken over by President Donald Trump.\n\nGlass is the latest musical luminary ‌to withdraw from the Kennedy Center since Trump named himself chairman and filled its board with his allies last year.

    "description": "What Trump does next will have \"huge implications\" including \"possibly lighting the tinderbox,\" Ray Dalio said.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio says a second killing by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month has put America on the verge of civil war.\n\n\"The United States is now a tinderbox,\" the billionaire investor wrote in an essay published Monday on X.\n\nHe said the federal government's clash with authorities in Minnesota and other states is \"bad and likely to get worse\" after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on Saturday. Renee Good was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents on January 7.\n\nDalio — the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds — said that if President Donald Trump doesn't back down, it would \"risk pushing us over the brink into a more clear civil war.\"\n\nThe US leader could prevent further escalation by appealing for peace, showing the justice system will deal with the shootings fairly, and reining in his immigration enforcement, Dalio said.\n\nThe path Trump chooses \"will have huge implications for what comes next, including possibly lighting the tinderbox,\" he added.\n\nTrump has pivoted to a more conciliatory tone since the weekend. In a Monday post on Truth Social, the president said he had a \"very good call\" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the pair were on a \"similar wavelength\" on how to proceed with immigration enforcement in his state.\n\n\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said.\n\nDalio is one of scores of business leaders to speak out about the situation in Minneapolis. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian urged US leaders in a X post to \"lead right now — deescalate,\" while philanthropist Melinda French Gates wrote on the platform that there's \"nothing more American than exercising our rights and holding our government accountable.\"\n\nDalio, the author of \"Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,\" said the conflicts raging in the US today echo the decline of past superpowers. He said it was \"like watching a movie that I have seen many times in history.\"\n\nHe drew a parallel to a passage from his book: \"When broad-based discontent bubbles up and those in power allow it to grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it explodes.\"\n\nDalio said on X that \"people dying in the fighting\" and \"conflicts between the states and the central government over their relative powers\" are two classic markers of the move into the \"more violent civil war stage,\" which often heralds the collapse of the \"monetary, domestic political, and international geopolitical orders.\"\n\nThe Wall Street titan and economic-history guru has been ringing the alarm on the crumbling of the current world order for several years now. In 2021, he pegged the probability of a US civil war within the next 10 years at 30%.\n\nHe has also decried the national debt of over $38 trillion, comparing it to an \"aggressive cancer\" and \"being on a boat headed to rocks.\"\n\nDalio wrote on X that the US needs to exercise greater \"financial discipline\" to protect its central role in the current monetary order, and resume abiding by the rules to allow disagreements to be resolved peacefully and democracy to function.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability, even as his administration remains mired in fallout over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in in Minneapolis.\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks. Trump’s sudden shift toward a more conciliatory approach is just the latest in a string of moments where he's taken maximalist positions, only to appear to retreat.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021.

Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "As marauding state agents fill US streets, a leading German soccer official says countries should consider what was once unthinkable: skipping the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a leading German soccer official, Oke Göttlich, said that the time has come to consider the unthinkable: a boycott of the World Cup to protest Donald J. Trump’s United States. The most watched sporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and Göttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti, that “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to state agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the people of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have been, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where the ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\n\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of the Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team whose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes beyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where this discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German national team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions. Göttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\n\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff titled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for countries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would threaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap 5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of the ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was sending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be toward fascist violence.\n\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that traveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their families would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is saying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the next level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has witnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During Trump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and presented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when paraded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an opportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief] Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\n\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far better historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these games to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of course, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four gold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\n\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for the entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive debates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already imprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion. Organizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a vote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These decisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards, quislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to be played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans. Now they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\n\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at watching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have bravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni Infantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to the bone.",

    "title": "What to expect from January's Fed meeting as Powell faces looming DOJ probe",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely hold rates steady at its January meeting, even as Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure from Trump amid the DOJ probe.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve will make its first rate decision of the year on Wednesday — and all eyes are on Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe central bank's leaders have a near-total chance of holding rates steady this week, according to market-based projections from CME FedWatch. After three cuts in 2025, the Fed has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. In the long run, these rate decisions will affect the job market, consumer prices, and corporate America.\n\nBut there's a shadow over January's Fed meeting: The Department of Justice recently launched a probe into Powell's handling of renovations to the central bank's buildings. The Trump administration alleges that the chair gave false testimony at a June Congressional appearance, though Powell said the move should \"be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\" on the Fed.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" he said in a video statement released January 11.\n\nFed decisions impact mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, inflation, and labor market churn over time. A slow but not catastrophically weak job market, combined with higher-than-ideal but relatively tame inflation, will probably mean a pause in rate cuts for now.\n\n\"There's little chance the Fed will vote to cut rates this week, as the data in-hand doesn't justify it,\" said NerdWallet's senior economist Elizabeth Renter, adding, \"The Fed's monetary policy job is a balancing act and their decision to keep rates as-is indicates the risks to either side of their dual mandate are relatively equal.\"\n\nThe central bank's dual mandate — to keep prices stable and the job market strong — has been tricky to balance lately. The US added fewer jobs than expected in December, the unemployment rate is hovering above 4%, and the inflation rate remained at 2.7%. If Fed leaders opt to hold rates steady rather than cut, it will be good news for inflation, at the risk of slowing down an already-sluggish jobs landscape.\n\nFor consumers, a hold means that interest rates for homes, cars, and credit cards would largely remain unchanged. The Fed also hopes to push inflation closer to its 2% goal. For job seekers, however, still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes.\n\nThe Fed has made more headlines than usual this month. Powell announced grand jury subpoenas from the Trump administration through a video message posted online. And Governor Lisa Cook's case has reached the Supreme Court, following accusations of mortgage fraud from Trump.\n\nThe Powell probe has raised alarm about Fed independence with politicians, economists, and business leaders. North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis and other congressional leaders said they will now oppose all nominees to the Fed chair role from the Trump administration.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to choose a successor as soon as this week. Frontrunners include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.\n\nThe president has been vocal in his desire for lower interest rates and hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on policy decisions.\n\n\"The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed,\" Renter said.",

    "fullText": "No matter how you slice it, it's been TrumpWorld in the stock market so far in 2026.\n\nSeemingly every day, the president is doing something new to stir up volatility in various asset classes and stock-market sectors. We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus.\n\nThat's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into.\n\nHere are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each.\n\nThis gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no \"will-they / won't-they\" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here.\n\nWhat traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas,\n\nMarket significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka \"selling America.\") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?)\n\nIf Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market.\n\nThis week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday.\n\nMarket significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership.\n\nTesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown.",

By early afternoon, the move sent the consulting firm's stock down more than 11%.\n\nThe department has 31 different contracts with the firm, worth $4.8 million in yearly spending and $21 million in obligations, it said in a press release.

    "fullText": "Newsom launched a review of the platform, despite TikTok saying a systems failure was responsible for the issue\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom has accused TikTok of suppressing content critical of president Donald Trump, as he launched a review of the platform’s content moderation practices to determine if they violated state law, even as the platform blamed a systems failure for the issues.\n\nThe step comes after TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said last week it had finalised a deal to set up a majority US-owned joint venture that will secure US data, to avoid a US ban on the short video app used by more than 200 million Americans.\n\n“Following TikTok’s sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports, and independently confirmed instances, of suppressed content critical of President Trump,” Newsom’s office said on X on Monday, without elaborating.\n\n“Gavin Newsom is launching a review of this conduct and is calling on the California Department of Justice to determine whether it violates California law,” it added.\n\nIn response, a representative for the the joint venture for TikTok in the US pointed to a prior statement that blamed a data centre power outage, adding, “It would be inaccurate to report that this is anything but the technical issues we’ve transparently confirmed.”\n\nUsers may notice bugs, slower load times or timed-out requests when posting new content due to the impact of the outage, the joint venture added.\n\n“While the network has been recovered, the outage caused a cascading systems failure that we’ve been working to resolve,” it said in the statement posted online before Newsom’s remarks.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been critical of each other. Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.\n\nCasey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.\n\nByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.\n\nWith more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nEach of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.\n\nThe US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares hit a new record on Tuesday as investors hoped for the best from a barrage of U.S. large-cap earnings, though uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves on South Korea boosted gold and silver.\n\nAccusing South Korea’s legislature of \"not living up\" to its trade deal with Washington, Trump late on Monday said he would increase tariffs on imports from Asia’s fourth-largest economy into the U.S. to 25%.\n\nStocks appeared to take the news in stride, with Nasdaq futures up 0.5%, as investors geared up for a slew of earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Tesla starting on Wednesday.\n\nEven South Korea’s KOSPI quickly reversed earlier losses to surge by more than 2%, hitting a new peak. European stocks are braced for a higher open, with EURO STOXX 50 futures up 0.3%.\n\n\"Enthusiasm over the most eventful earnings week of the season has investors raising exposure to tech shares ahead of four of the Magnificent Seven reporting results,\" said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nOn Trump’s higher tariffs on South Korea, Torres believed a visit from South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan to Washington as soon as this Friday could \"ease tensions and buy its government some additional time to improve relations.\"\n\nStill, the uncertainty lifted safe-haven gold by 1% to $5,065 an ounce, just shy of an all-time high of $5,110, while silver gained 4% to $108 an ounce, not far from a record of $117.70 that was set on Monday.\n\n\"The frenetic nature of uncertainty, coupled with a weaker dollar, have been the primary contributors to this latest leg higher (for gold),\" said Christopher Louney, a commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nLouney said history suggested the current gold rally could run into early September or mid-December this year, adding that prices could go as high as $7,100 per ounce at the end of the year based on its 2025 performance.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to hit a new record high. The Nikkei gained 0.7%, even with the recent sharp rebound in the yen clouding the outlook for Japan’s vast export sector.\n\nChinese blue chips rose 0.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is coming under fire again in the first few weeks of 2026 as a growing range of factors - including Washington’s desire for a weaker currency and Trump’s erratic policymaking - prompts a rethink of investors’ optimistic assumptions for a period of greenback stability.\n\nIts latest slump to more than four-month lows was driven by sharp gains in the Japanese yen starting on Friday when chatter about rate checks by the New York Fed fuelled the risk of a joint U.S.-Japan intervention to halt the yen’s slide.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.2% to 154.55 yen on Tuesday, having lost a staggering 2.6% over the past two sessions, which was well below the 160 yen level that is viewed as a line in the sand for Japanese authorities.\n\nAgainst six major currencies, the greenback was flat at 97.12, near a 4-1/2 month low of 96.8.\n\nIn the Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 4.2292% after falling for four straight sessions away from a recent peak of 4.313%.\n\nWorries about another U.S. government shutdown are also brewing in the background, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over funding for Trump’s Department of Homeland Security after the fatal shooting of a second U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\n\nOil prices fell on Tuesday as investors kept an eye on a resumption in supply from Kazakhstan. Brent crude futures dropped 0.7% to $65.13 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6% to $60.25.",

Dans un communiqué envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, Bercy annonce avoir pour projet de lancer son propre outil de visioconférence d’ici 2027, pour",
    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "fullText": "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino - dubbed 'little Napoleon' - has been ordered to leave Minneapolis in a major shakeup initiated by Tom Homan.\n\nDonald Trump sidelined Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, dispatching Border Czar Homan, an ICE veteran, to take charge of the deteriorating crisis in Minnesota after a protester was shot dead on Saturday.\n\nHoman is expected to hold a press conference later today where Bovino's departure, along with that of hundreds of his agents, will be announced.\n\nThe decision is aimed at de-escalating the violence between federal agents and rioters which exploded on Saturday after the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse.\n\nBovino, the controversial face of Trump's crackdown and a close ally of Noem, sparked fury in the White House when he claimed Pretti intended to 'massacre' federal agents.\n\nTrump spent hours on Sunday and Monday watching cable news coverage and was unsettled by how the administration was being portrayed, one official told CNN.\n\nNoem branded the ICU nurse a 'domestic terrorist' and claimed he brandished a firearm, sparking further frustration among administration officials.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced Trump from Noem's language on Monday, arguing that it was not a position that the President had taken.\n\nBorder Patrol chief Gregory Bovino observes a protest in Minneapolis on January 15\n\nFederal agents point weapons at protesters near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nBorder Czar Tom Homan visits 'Varney & Co.' at Fox Business Network on January 13\n\nBovino is a loyalist to Noem and her rumored lover Corey Lewandowski, and both have quietly pushed him as a potential replacement for current Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, a longtime ally of Homan.\n\nNoem has sought to sideline Scott by having Bovino report directly to her, an unprecedented move within the agency.\n\nBovino's removal from Minneapolis underscores Noem's fading standing with the White House as Trump dispatches Homan and his closest allies to seize control of the operation on the ground.\n\nA Border Patrol veteran of 30 years, Bovino was selected last year from his role as chief patrol agent of the agency's El Centro sector in Southern California to lead highly publicized immigration crackdowns across the country.\n\nHis aggressive tactics, often highly choreographed public displays, sparked backlash from local officials.\n\nBovino often stood out as the only agent not wearing a face covering when Border Patrol descended on Home Depots and gas stations.\n\nHe has gone viral on social media as he is frequently spotted on the frontlines sporting a severe buzzcut and trench coat, which German media has likened to a 'Nazi aesthetic'.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said on X: 'Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process.'\n\nA protester is pepper sprayed at close range while being detained near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference at the headquarters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to discuss a major winter storm affecting much of the country as well as the shooting death of a Minneapolis man by federal agents in Minnesota, in Washington, DC, on January 24\n\nBovino hit back, claiming he had the coat for more than 25 years and it was official Border Patrol merchandise.\n\nJenn Budd, an author and expert on Border Patrol, described Bovino as 'the Liberace' of the agency.\n\n'He was just a little Napoleon who wants you to think that he is the most moral and capable guy in the world, and everything around you is dangerous but he's the one who's going to save you,' Budd told The Times. 'It's all a show for him.'\n\nHe once invited journalists to watch him swim across a canal in Southern California's Imperial Valley in a bid to deter migrants considering the crossing.\n\nAfter Trump was re-elected Bovino used similar public relations expertise to catch the president's eye.\n\nHe sent dozens of agents to arrest migrants at gas stations along the highway ahead of Trump's inauguration.\n\nAsked why Bovino was chosen to lead the force, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told reporters bluntly: 'Because he's a badass.'\n\nBut while Bovino's strongman image earned him Trump's respect, his self-proclaimed 'turn and  burn' enforcement strategies have sparked concern.\n\nA federal judge accused Bovino in November of being 'evasive' and at times 'outright lying' in sworn testimony about an immigration crackdown in Chicago, finding his account 'simply not credible.'\n\nJudge Sara Ellis wrote that Bovino even admitted he lied about being hit with a rock before ordering tear gas used, and noted that video evidence flatly contradicted his claim that he never tackled a protester.",

    "description": "Geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariff threats, and inflation fears have helped propel gold to $5,000 for the first time ever on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Gold is surging yet again, with the metal touching $5,000 an ounce on Monday for the first time ever.\n\nBehind the latest rally is the familiar cocktail of tailwinds that are bullish for gold, but less so for other parts of the market and the economy. The \"sell America\" trade is still getting a boost, inflationary concerns linger, and fears about geopolitical crises continue to percolate.\n\nHere are the latest updates on what's driving gold's parabolic rally to all-time highs.\n\nGold jumped more than 2% on Monday as trade tensions roil markets once again after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes any sort of trade agreement with China.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nGold tends to play a \"flight-to-safety\" role in markets. When investors get scared about the economic consequences of Trump upending trade with key allies, they've often flocked to the metal for shelter.\n\nThe threatening rhetoric against allies like Canada and last week's sabre-rattling from Trump about taking over Greenland sparked a return of the \"Sell America\" trade, which has boosted gold over the last year.\n\nAs gold spiked to fresh highs on Monday, the dollar index fell almost 1% against major rivals to about $96.96.\n\nOccupying a similar place in investors' minds to \"Sell America\" is the debasement trade, which continues to boost metals like gold as markets fret about other safe havens such as Treasurys.\n\nGold bulls say that a weakening of the US dollar and other fiat currencies as governments pursue aggressive fiscal policies will boost more stable stores of value.\n\nTrump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and Jerome Powell has been the latest update that has investors fretting over currency debasement and flocking to gold. The thinking is that political meddling with monetary policy and a dovish new Fed chair could lead to lower interest rates and spur a new period of inflation down the road. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices among investors.\n\nThe debasement trade was a dominant theme in markets in 2025, and analysts have eyed it as a driver of bullish forecasts for 2026.\n\nAccording to Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX advisors, arguably the biggest driver in gold's outperformance over the last few years has been global central bank buying.\n\n\"After COVID, when America printed all this money, central banks — and it was led by China — quite literally doubled their annual purchases of gold, and they were selling Treasurys to do so,\" McMillan told Business Insider.\n\nCentral banks have also been trying to diversify their holdings away from US dollars, a trend that accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That prompted the US to freeze Russia's dollar reserves, drawing criticism over \"weaponization\" of the dollar and sparking more gold buying from countries like China.\n\nHeightened uncertainty is the heart of gold's bull case for many investors, and the geopolitical outlook looks shakier than it has in a long time.\n\nFrom Trump's moves in Venezuela, the ongoing war in Ukraine, turmoil in Iran, and a strained NATO alliance, gold bugs have a lot to worry about these days. As current conflicts stretch into 2026, analysts say they expect gold's safe-haven status to keep surging.\n\nFinally, the fear of missing out on a meme-like rally might be behind some of the moves. Gold is up 87% since the start of 2025, and has spiked 25% since October.\n\nThe gains are too good for some to watch from the sidelines.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, retail traders have been pouring money into gold recently, egged on by talk of the \"Sell America\" trade and an endless parade of bulls who say precious metals will keep rising.\n\nSilver is up even more than gold in the last year, and market pros told Business Insider that they worry the flight to safety itself has become a major investment bubble that could end badly for investors chasing the rally.",

Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,\" the statement said.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
