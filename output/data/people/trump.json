    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he's wasting no time when it comes to oil in Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump said that the interim president of Venezuela will \"be turning over\" between 30 and 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil, and that the oil would be sold at market prices, with the revenue overseen by him as president to ensure it benefits both Venezuela and the US.\n\n\"It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHe added that he directed Energy Secretary Chris Wright to carry out the plan \"immediately.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the plan will face legal hurdles, and further details are unknown. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.\n\nThe current interim leader of Venezuela is Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as acting president on January 5, 2026, after the US captured and detained the country's former President Nicolás Maduro, alongside his wife. Rodríguez is a longtime Maduro loyalist and originally served as the Vice President of Venezuela. She has so far not spoken out on whether she would cooperate with Trump's plan.\n\nTrump's comments build on his previous remarks that he would \"take back\" Venezuela's oil reserves and revive the country's battered energy sector, which has faced sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump also previously said in an interview with NBC News that the US could reimburse American oil companies for expanding their operations in Venezuela, but he did not have an estimate on how much the subsidy would cost.\n\nEven though a larger supply could lead to lower costs for American consumers, the downward pressure on prices could disincentivize large oil companies from investing in Venezuela. It could also take years to build functioning infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela's oil production currently accounts for less than 1% of the global oil output, despite possessing the world's largest known oil reserves.",

    "fullText": "Meta has hired C.J. Mahoney, a former senior Microsoft legal executive and onetime Trump administration official, as its next chief legal officer, Axios reported.\n\nMahoney will replace Jennifer Newstead, who announced in December that she would leave Meta after more than five years to become Apple's general counsel. Mahoney is set to start on Wednesday and will report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the Axios report said.\n\n\"I'm excited to join Meta as it leads the way in AI innovation and continues to connect people around the world,\" Mahoney said in a statement that Meta shared with Business Insider. \"As I close an incredible chapter at Microsoft and begin a new one at Meta, I'm grateful for the trust Mark and the Board have placed in me.\"\n\n\"C.J. brings world-class legal expertise, passion for frontier technology, and deep insight into the global regulatory challenges facing our industry,\" said Zuckerberg in a statement shared with Business Insider. \"I'm looking forward to working with him to advance Meta's mission to build the future of human connection.\"\n\nMahoney previously served as Microsoft's corporate vice president and deputy general counsel and earlier worked as deputy US trade representative during President Donald Trump's first term.\n\nIn his new role, he will oversee Meta's global legal strategy as the company continues to face scrutiny over antitrust, data privacy, online safety, and the protection of children and teenagers.\n\nNewstead's departure marked the end of a consequential period for Meta's legal team. During her tenure, the company secured a major win against the Federal Trade Commission when a federal judge rejected the agency's attempt to force Meta to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMahoney's appointment comes as Meta continues to navigate intensifying regulatory pressure worldwide, including debates over artificial intelligence, social media governance, and data protection.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Many Greenlanders are interested in working with the US, but they all bristle at the idea of being bought or taken by force.",
    "fullText": "If Greenlanders weren't concerned by President Donald Trump's threats to annex the territory in his first term, many of them are now.\n\nIn the days since the United States' surprise raid into Venezuela, there's been a renewed focus on Trump's interest in the island, sparking fear among locals.\n\n\"I don't know what he's able to do. Most of me is trying to tell myself, 'Don't worry, everything's going to be fine,' but still I'm worried,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer in South Greenland, told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen on Tuesday.\n\nCasper Frank Møller, CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, echoed Kleist's concerns, saying that he and many of his peers are worried about how the situation may affect their finances.\n\n\"We've made investments into developing our tourism aspects of our company, and it comes with risk now because of the geopolitical situation and the threats by Trump, so of course, yeah, we're all really worried,\" he told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, since his first term in office. He has argued that Greenland's location makes it strategically important, as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China. The island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nWhen Trump initially raised the topic of buying Greenland in 2019, Greenlandic influencer and engineer Qupanuk Olsen told Business Insider she and other locals thought it was a joke, and said she still didn't take it seriously when Trump resurfaced talks in late 2024.\n\nThat changed when Donald Trump Jr. visited Nuuk in January 2025. \"That's when we realized that Trump's words were no longer just words,\" Olsen said in June. \"They are real, and he means what he says.\" Business Insider wasn't able to reach Olsen this week for a follow-up.\n\nIn the wake of the raid on Venezuela, Møller said on Tuesday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland feel \"much more realistic that it will actually happen\" than when he spoke with Business Insider in January 2025.\n\nUS interest had at least one positive effect, Olsen said in June: It pushed Greenlanders to think more seriously about their place in the world and the need to speak for themselves.\n\n\"It was such a huge wake-up call for everyone in Greenland because suddenly we needed to have an opinion whether we still want to stay under Denmark, whether we should become independent, or whether we should become a state under the United States,\" she said. \"We certainly had options. So those options were helpful in the beginning for the independence movement.\"\n\nThat mindset may be shifting. Kleist said she's worried that \"we as the local indigenous Greenlandic people are slowly going against each other now,\" she told Business Insider on Tuesday. Some want to stand with America, others with Denmark, she said. Ultimately, though, the dream is for Greenland to become its own independent country, she added.\n\n\"We want Greenland to be the Greenlanders, and we're not for sale. We are not to be taken over,\" Møller said.\n\nNaaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister of natural resources, business, energy, justice, and gender equality, said in June that she sees much of the American administration's interest in Greenland as an opportunity for collaboration. But she said the way Trump is going about it is wrong.\n\n\"I think if we take the temperature down a bit and de-escalate the conflict level and the rhetoric, I think we can, in agreement with each other, find many paths forward that are mutually beneficial for both the US and for us,\" Nathanielsen said in June. \"But we don't appreciate being talked about as a commodity, as something you can buy or sell or acquire or take. That is, of course, offensive to all people.\"\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.\n\n\"The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,\" she wrote. \"We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism. We have had our share of that.\"\n\nDenmark, Trump has argued, is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" Trump told a group of reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the US in a statement to \"stop the threats against a historically close ally.\" Frederiksen has previously rejected Trump's suggestions outright, telling him that Greenland is not for sale and that any idea of annexation is \"absurd.\"\n\nFrederiksen has warned that any US military action against Greenland would severely damage NATO unity, raising questions about whether the alliance could withstand such a conflict between allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, major European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement defending Greenland. \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterms or else he will get impeached by Democrats.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterm elections or else he will get impeached by Democrats.\n\n\"You gotta win the midterms 'cause, if we don't win the midterms, it's just gonna be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,\" Trump said at a retreat for House Republican lawmakers in Washington. \"I'll get impeached.\"\n\nThe president urged his fellow Republicans to fight in a more unified fashion on issues ranging from gender politics to healthcare and election reforms, and to sell his policies to a public angry about cost of living issues.\n\nTrump's agenda is on the line in November's elections, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate's seats will be contested.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump predicted an epic win for Republicans in the elections but also expressed concerns about historical precedent that the party of the sitting president usually fares poorly.\n\n\"They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Center, a Washington performing arts center that was recently renamed to include a mention of Trump. \"I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,\" Trump said.\n\nHouse Republicans have shown enormous deference to Trump so far, ceding much of Congress' authority over spending and other matters to his administration. But they have started to show glimmers of independence. The House could vote this week to override a veto Trump issued last month that canceled water projects in Colorado and Utah, though it is not clear whether the effort will get the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House of Representatives during his 2017-2021 term in office, faulting him for what they said were abuses of power involving Ukraine and ahead of the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt, Bo Erickson, Andy Sullivan and Richard Cowan, Editing by Franklin Paul and Alistair Bell",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday took more shots at Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), insisting there was “something wrong” with the Kentucky Republican.\n\nIn recent months, Massie repeatedly broke from the GOP and criticized the actions of Trump. Massie has most notably aligned with Democrats on the issue of deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, joining Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) in his crusade to release the Epstein files.\n\nWeeks before U.S. forces invaded Venezuela and apprehended President Nicolas Maduro, Massie claimed Trump’s interest in the country was primarily about “oil and regime change.”\n\nIn response, Trump has consistently shaded Massie for his perceived betrayal of the Republican Party. On Christmas, the president called out Massie by name in a Truth Social post.\n\nDuring his remarks at a GOP retreat in Washington, D.C., Trump praised the efforts of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) before continuing his attacks on Massie:\n\n“A lot of times they’ll say, ‘I wish Mike were tougher.’ He’s tough. He’s tough as anybody in the room, actually. But can’t be tough when you have a majority of three — and now, sadly, a little bit less than that. But, you can’t be Trump. You can’t, ‘I want you!’ You know, you make 10 enemies, 20 enemies. That’s the end of that, right?” mused Trump. “Everybody loves him. I would say there’s one person he’s given up on. He just gave up on this guy. He’s so bad. He never votes for us. No matter how good, he won’t vote for us. There’s a sickness there. There’s something wrong. You can have the greatest bill, the greatest for the country — forget about for Republicans — great, great, great for the country. ‘I’m a no vote.’ We don’t even bother calling him at three in the morning, do we?”\n\nThe post ‘There’s a Sickness There’: Trump Tells House Republicans ‘There’s Something Wrong’ With Their Colleague Thomas Massie first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "fullText": "President says a ‘tremendous amount of money’ will need to be spent repairing country’s infrastructure\n\nWhy Venezuelan crude appeals to US refineries\n\nVenezuela live – latest updates\n\nDonald Trump has suggested US taxpayers could reimburse energy companies for repairing Venezuelan infrastructure for extracting and shipping oil.\n\nTrump acknowledged that “a lot of money” would need to be spent to increase oil production in Venezuela after US forces ousted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, but suggested his government could pay oil companies to do the work.\n\n“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” the president said.\n\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, reportedly plans to meet representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil at the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech & Utilities Conference in Miami later this week.\n\nRepresentatives of Trump’s administration are planning to meet executives to discuss increasing Venezuelan production, Reuters reported.\n\nThe meetings are crucial to the Trump administration’s hopes of getting top oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.\n\nThe three biggest US oil companies – Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s removal, Reuters reported. This contradicted Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, before and since Maduro was seized.\n\n“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to increase production and exports of heavy, unctuous crude from Venezuela, a former Opec nation that sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be processed by specially designed US refineries.\n\nAchieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.\n\nVenezuela produces on average about 1.1m barrels of oil a day, down from the 3.5m barrels produced in 1999 before a government takeover of the domestic industry.\n\nIt is unclear which executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move in to Venezuela.\n\n“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\n\nExxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment to Reuters.\n\nAsked if the administration had briefed any oil companies before the military operation, Trump said, “No. But we’ve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”\n\n“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News. “But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”\n\nHe told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies. “I speak to everybody,” he said.\n\nTrump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars increase Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades because of underinvestment and sanctions.\n\nBut those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.\n\nChevron is the only US major operating in Venezuela’s oilfields. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operated in the country before their projects were nationalised by former president Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025 on Monday, as Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

Experts have said that the move could reshape the global energy market, disadvantaging China and Russia.\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\" Trump said in a public address.\n\nTrump's comments followed an early Saturday raid in which US armed forces and law enforcement struck parts of the capital, Caracas, and captured Maduro and his wife.\n\nIn Monday's NBC interview, Trump said, \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"\n\nLower oil prices could mean cheaper gas for average Americans, but may also disincentivize the \"very large United States oil companies\" that Trump said he may subsidize.\n\nTrump added it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had spoken to executives at Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, America's three largest oil producers.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year.

    "fullText": "Syril, 25, carries a large banner of the US constitution with a number of other demonstrators during a protest marking US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, in Washington, DC, US, 30 April 2025. REUTERS/Allison Bailey\n\nThe Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. Global Insight assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it.\n\nOn 8 March, recent Colombia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from dinner with his eight-month pregnant wife when he was arrested and forced into an unmarked car by four agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal resident in the US, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests on Colombia’s campus last spring. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana awaiting deportation and has not been charged with a crime.\n\n‘They are targeting the most vulnerable people who are standing up for Palestinian rights,’ says Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, which is working closely with the lawyers on Khalil’s case. ‘The idea is to basically get people to stop protesting what’s happening in Gaza.’\n\nIn the short time that US president Donald Trump has held power, his administration has weaponised the federal government to suppress speech and punish his adversaries. In what many experts have challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights, a cornerstone of US democracy, President Trump has threatened protestors, banned news outlets from covering White House events and used executive orders to sanction law firms who he believes attacked him unfairly in the past. Subsequent court cases will test America’s most fundamental checks and balances on executive power.\n\nJonathan Hafetz\n\n Membership Officer, IBA Human Rights Law Committee\n\n‘We are seeing the gravest assault on freedom of speech at least since the McCarthy era, and I think in many respects the nation’s history,’ says Jonathan Hafetz, a professor of law at Seton Hall Law School and Membership Officer of the IBA Human Rights Law Committee.\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Khalil is part of a series of actions taken by the Trump administration against foreign students who have expressed support for Palestinians. Students and faculty members at US universities across the country have been detained by federal agents and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his department has revoked at least 300 foreign students’ visas. Following arrests, government lawyers have cited a provision of a rarely used 1952 immigration law that allows the Secretary of State to revoke visas or permanent residency from anyone judged to be undermining US foreign policy. Jameel Jaffer, the inaugural director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, an independent organisation founded by Colombia University, believes that the arrests and detentions of foreign students are ‘impossible to reconcile’ with the First Amendment, and predicts that the courts will eventually make clear that it protects non-citizens from deportation. ‘At the most basic level if the First Amendment means anything it means that the government can’t arrest you or imprison you for political speech,’ he says. ‘That is the core protection of the First Amendment.’\n\nIn March, the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP chapters at Havard, NYU and Rutgers, and the Middle East Studies Association, represented by the Knight Institute, filed a lawsuit in Boston seeking to block the arrests, detentions and deportations of international students and staff ‘who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.’\n\nJaffer adds, however, that the question of whether the Trump administration will comply with any court rulings remains. ‘Both the court’s willingness to enforce their orders and the Trump administration’s decisions about how to respond to the court orders will be influenced by perceptions of public opinion,’ he says.\n\nAlongside visa revocations in recent months the US government commenced a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records from a national database. A visa revocation, while significant, only impacts a person’s ability to return to the country, whereas eliminating a student’s SEVIS status puts them at risk of deportation. The government has since reversed the policy and reactivated most records following hundreds of lawsuits filed by students who said their records had been terminated based on charges that had been dismissed or minor offences that would not warrant a cancellation. NAFSA, an educational non-profit, found that some SEVIS record terminations referenced ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.’\n\nAdam Cohen, an immigration lawyer and partner at Siskind Susser in Tennessee, is concerned by the lack of due process and transparency related to the SEVIS terminations, which he says could resume at any time. ‘The problem is when they’re terminating the SEVIS record, they’re making people believe that they need to leave immediately and they’re not even getting to that hearing in an immigration court,’ he says. ‘It’s not even clear what the issue was right? What was the adverse foreign policy? In certain cases, did they repost something on social media?’\n\nIn addition to the crackdown on international students the White House has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding from at least 60 universities unless they agree to a set of demands to address alleged failures to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism and drop diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, elite US university Havard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the funding freeze violates procedural requirements and its First Amendment Rights to freedom of speech. To restore its funding, Colombia University agreed to many of the administration’s demands including allowing security officers to remove or arrest individuals and taking control of its Middle East department from faculty.\n\nJameel Jaffer\n\n Director, Knight First Amendment Institute\n\nIn response to the action against Colombia, of the country’s top constitutional professors, both liberal and conservatives, wrote an open letter critical of the Trump administration’s use of funding cuts ‘as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First-Amendment protected speech,' which can extend to viewpoints ‘many of us find wrongheaded or deeply offensive.’ The First Amendment offers broad protections and guarantees freedom of the press, speech, religion, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government.\n\nJaffer says the damage being done while students and universities wait for court judgments is significant. ‘It has created a climate of fear and repression on campuses across the country,’ he says. ‘It’s caused an intense chilling effect and really changed the character of American universities quite dramatically.’\n\nIn certain cases, the question of whether the executive branch would defy a ruling by a federal judge has already been answered. In February the chief judge of the US Court for the District of Colombia ordered the US government to halt deportation flights carrying immigrants alleged to be Venezuelan gang members. But officials chose to ignore the order. ‘This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!’ President Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. In April, the FBI arrested a judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s refusal to turn the planes around, many commentators have declared the US in a constitutional crisis. Steven Richman is Chair of the IBA’s Bar Issue Commission and a member at Clark Hill. He says while Trump undermining judges is concerning, the fears about him transforming the US into an authoritarian state should be placed in context. ‘Since Marbury v Madison established the primacy of judicial review in 1803, by which the federal courts could declare legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions as unconstitutional, presidents of various parties from time to time have been alleged to have defied the Supreme Court. The facts of each situation and specific rulings of the Court remain important to evaluate the executive’s conduct. What is significant is that there remains an acknowledgement that the rule of law governs, and Marbury v Madison remains in place.’\nSome of the most aggressive escalations of the Trump administration’s assaults on the legal system have manifested in a barrage of executive orders punishing large commercial law firms who have represented his political opponents or been involved in causes against him. The orders, which allege wrongdoing by individual lawyers and civil rights law violations by affirmative action schemes, terminate the firms from government contracts and restrict their employees from access to federal buildings. To avoid the sanctions, multiple law firms have cut deals with President Trump and collectively agreed to provide $940m in pro bono work for causes his administration supports. Others have decided to stand firm.\n\n‘The order is a plain violation of the First Amendment,’ Jenner & Block said, which, alongside Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, successfully obtained preliminary court rulings to block the executive orders. ‘Our constitution forbids attempts by the government to retaliate against citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice and the people with whom they associate.’\n\nRichman says the government using executive power to take revenge on lawyers is problematic and a direct challenge to the independence of the legal profession. ‘If someone feels that a law firm has brought a frivolous or legally unjustified claim, there are remedies at law for pursuing such claims. The end can never justify the means. The means – due process, fairness, respect for the social contract and political will that underlies a system – must be respected.’\n\nIn response to the executive orders more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief, accusing the Trump administration of a campaign of ‘draconian punishment’ against lawyers who have acted for clients it disapproves of. ‘Whatever short-term advantage the administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.’\n\nSome lawyers at firms who are unhappy with their employer’s decision to negotiate a deal with President Trump have quit their jobs in protest. One such former associate, Rachel Cohen, gave up her role at a prestigious white shoe law firm because of its decision not to challenge the Trump administration’s sanctioning of the legal profession. ‘I sent what I considered a conditional resignation that either we need to do something about this real infringement on the legal system, on democracy, on traditional impartiality, or I can’t work here anymore.’\n\nCohen, who has now joined recently launched firm Lowell and Associates, which is dedicated to representing those facing legal actions from the Trump administration, believes that the agreements law firms are reaching with Trump are shortsighted, especially in the cases where they have proactively made a deal with Trump to avoid an executive order being issued in the first place. ‘I don’t know why anyone would think that a president who has a history of not respecting people who he has entered into deals with would respect the terms of a terrible deal when people have shown them what their weak spots are,’ she says.\n\nLower courts have been strong in opposing President Trump’s efforts to undermine the legal system and suppress freedom of speech. A federal judge in Washington, DC temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order against Susman Godfrey, which helped Dominion (a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers for Trump falsely accused of deleting votes for him in the 2020 election) secure a $700m settlement to resolve a defamation case against Fox News. The judge called the executive order ‘a shocking abuse of power’, which stemmed from a ‘personal vendetta.'\n\n‘It was a clear attempt to retaliate against the law firm for representing a client that was seeking to hold Fox News to account for spreading lies and misinformation about the 2020 election,’ says Hafetz. ‘This is why it is so surprising and disappointing that some law firms have sought to cut deals with the Trump administration because those firms that have fought back have been vindicated and received relief.’\n\nIn its statement after the settlement, Fox acknowledged that the court found some of its statements about Dominion to be false, but said its settlement ‘reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’\n\nAlongside law firms, major media organisations have chosen to negotiate with Trump rather than challenge his attacks. In the run up to President Trump’s inauguration ABC News quickly settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump and Meta agreed to pay $25m to resolve a lawsuit over its decision to suspend Trump from its social media platforms following the January 6 attack on the US capital. In another notable move, the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times pulled their presidential endorsements.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to news organisations it disfavours. The Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. In February, the White House announced that it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water the Gulf of America. The White House said it would also exert greater control over which news outlets would get access to the president.\n\nPeople take part in a rally organised by Jewish activists against the detention by ICE agents of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City, U.S., 20 March 2025. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nGovernments favouring certain news organisations over others ‘is part of the authoritarian playbook,’ says Mark Stephens, Co-Chair of the IBA’s Human Rights Institute. ‘Banning the Associated Press essentially covering Trump in the way you would normally expect is designed to interfere with the free flow of information.’\n\nMel Bunce, a professor of international journalism and politics at City St George’s, University of London, says that the seriousness of the ban is underscored by the vital role of the Associated Press as a conduit for information. ‘The Associated Press is an incredibly important news organisation that is relied on by hundreds of news outlets around the world. Alongside Reuters and AFP, it is one of the most important building blocks of the international news system,’ she says. ‘It is one of the most rigorous and fact-based news organisations, and their news is shared globally – to millions of people in audiences around the world. And that’s why this is such a red flag.’\n\nWhile targeting the mainstream media, the Trump administration has branded itself as the ultimate defender of free speech. Trump officials backed up by billionaire social media owners have become fervent critics of ‘censorship’ coming from ‘woke’ progressivism that, they argue, would like to constrain the First Amendment.\n\nIn April a federal judge in a preliminary injunction ordered the White House to restore the access of The Associated Press access to cover presidential events, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organisation for the content of its speech. Trump administration lawyers argued in court filings that the Associated Press does not have a constitutional right to specific presidential events.\n\nIn a show of solidarity against the ban, 40 news organisations signed a letter urging the White House to reverse the restrictions on the Associated Press. The signatories included outlets like Fox News and Newsmax, where many of the broadcasters and audience members are Trump supporters.\n\nAmy Brouillette is Director of Advocacy at the International Press Institute, an organisation that works to defend press freedom and independent journalism. ‘Limiting access to media pool events because of the news agency’s editorial decisions stifles freedom of speech,’ she says. ‘News organisations should be allowed to make editorial decisions without fear of retaliation from government officials.’\n\nIn another setback to the Trump administration a federal judge temporarily blocked its dismantling of state-funded broadcaster Voice of America, following an executive order accusing it of being ‘anti-Trump’ and ‘radical’. The director of Voice of America, Mike Abramowitz announced that almost his entire staff of 1,300 people had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance funding, is also impacting independent journalism internationally. ‘The recent freezing of USAID is having a very serious impact on the media and civil society organisations that play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency,’ says Brouillette. ‘The role that the media and civil society play is not only important for democracy but it’s also important for peace and security.’\n\nAlice Johnson is the IBA Multimedia Journalist and can be contacted at alice.johnson@int-bar.org",

I didn‘t feel it was a comeback, actually,” Trump shot back, apparently offended by Graham forgetting that the 2020 election, by his account, was “rigged.”\n\nThe South Carolina Republican was quick to move the conversation on.\n\n“The bottom line is, we have a drug caliphate in our backyard,” Graham said.\n\nThe exchange took place as the president traveled back to the White House from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where he’s understood to have watched a livestream of Saturday night’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGraham had already sung Trump’s praises over that seizure, decried by critics as an illegal assault on the rules-based international order, during a Fox News appearance late Sunday.\n\n“The military operation in Venezuela showed America at her best, all thanks to our incredible men and women in uniform,” the senator wrote in an X post, sharing a clip from that interview. “Maduro miscalculated our Commander in Chief, and President [Donald Trump] made clear he will not be trifled with.”",

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "description": "\"Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?\"",
    "fullText": "Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.\n\nNow there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.\n\nAs spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.\n\nThe account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.\n\nThe evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.\n\n“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.\n\nWho was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.\n\nAs Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.\n\nIn other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?\n\nPrediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”\n\nAs The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.\n\nEven Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.\n\n“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.\n\n“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.\n\nMore on Polymarket: New App Lets Users Bet on Deadly Conflicts in Real Time",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is fretting that the Supreme Court will shoot down his signature tariffs initiative and declare it illegal.\n\nIn a panicked Truth Social post, the 79-year-old pushed the false claim that his tariffs generated $600 billion for the U.S. while suggesting there is a media blackout on their dubious benefits.\n\n“We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs, but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

    "description": "The rumor that Melania Trump escorted before meeting her now-husband has been spreading for almost a decade.",
    "fullText": "In December 2025, social media posts on sites including X and Facebook shared images claiming that Melania Trump, the U.S. first lady, worked as an escort before she met her now-husband, President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to the posts, Melania Trump began escorting under a man named Paolo Zampolli, who was good friends with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was arrested on charges of child sex trafficking in 2019 and was later found dead by suicide in his jail cell. Maxwell was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122243189684255019&set=pcb.122243189810255019\n\nSnopes readers searched the site looking \n\nThe claim that Melania Trump worked as an escort before meeting Donald Trump has been spreading online since at least August 2016, when the U.K.-based tabloid Daily Mail published an article making that allegation. In August 2025, Hunter Biden, the son of former President Joe Biden, claimed that Epstein introduced the two in an interview on Channel 5, a YouTube channel run by journalist Andrew Callaghan.\n\nHowever, according to the BBC and NPR, Melania Trump sued the Daily Mail and a blogger in the U.S. who also shared the claim for defamation, seeking $150 million in damages. Her lawyer, Charles Harder, told the BBC the claim was \"outright lying.\" She also threatened to sue Hunter Biden for $1 billion, according to the BBC.\n\nThe lawsuits could be viewed as SLAPP suits, a term that \"refers to lawsuits brought by individuals and entities to dissuade their critics from continuing to produce negative publicity,\" according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute.\n\nHowever, both the blogger and the Daily Mail settled the lawsuits, retracted the articles and paid damages to Trump, according to Politico and previous reporting from Snopes. Meanwhile, in a follow-up video published on Channel 5, Biden refused to apologize for his comments, claiming the information has also been reported by journalist Michael Wolff, who has written 4 books on Trump's time in office, and by The New York Times. (The Times' story says Epstein claimed he introduced the two.)\n\nIn sum, there's no evidence that the claim, which came from a tabloid with a history of spreading unfounded rumors, has any basis in reality.\n\nThe rumor may have seemed believable because it sprinkled in small tidbits of true information. According to reporting from Today and The Times of London, the Trumps did indeed meet at a party hosted by Zampolli, a former modeling agent who represented Melania Trump in the 1990s. A 2016 profile of Melania Trump in Harper's Bazaar and a profile of Zampolli published by the digital magazine Air Mail also claimed that he introduced the couple.\n\nThe claim that Zampolli was Melania Trump's \"escort agent\" might feel somewhat intuitive, given their established connection — it is not unheard of for sex workers to moonlight as models. However, that claim is unfounded and has no evidence supporting it.\n\nFinally, the photo of Melania Trump with her roommate Matthew Atanian often attached to post spreading the rumor was legitimate. It appeared in a Times of London article published in 2016. Some posts claimed the photo showed Trump with Zampolli, and in one copypasta (text repeatedly copied and shared verbatim online), Atanian's name was misspelled as \"Matthew Arabian.\"\n\nBryant, Kenzie. \"Say What You Will About Melania Trump, but She Seems Like a Great Roommate.\" Vanity Fair, 18 Jun. 2020, https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/melania-trump-biography-revelations.\n\nDaily. \"Melania Trump - An Apology.\" Mail Online, 12 Apr. 2017, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4404142/index.html.\n\n\"Donald and Melania Trump: A Timeline of Their Relationship.\" TODAY.Com, 20 Jan. 2025, https://www.today.com/popculture/donald-trump-melania-trump-relationship-timeline-rcna172256.\n\nGerstein, Josh. \"Maryland Judge Dismisses Melania Trump's Libel Suit against Daily Mail.\" Politico, 2 Feb. 2017, https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2017/02/melania-trumps-libel-suit-daily-mail-234578.\n\n\"Melania Trump Sues Daily Mail and US Blogger for $150m over Sex Worker Claims.\" BBC News, 1 Sep. 2016.

    "fullText": "ST PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats' 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term as governor amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into child care programs in the state.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,\" making it impossible for him to serve full-time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,\" Walz said at the state capitol. \"So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the president's attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nDespite the opaque references, Walz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he'd found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. But the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video's creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor's decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nWalz's exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats currently hold 24 out of 50 governor's seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota's, on the ballot in 2026.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris' defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz's announcement\n\nReactions to Walz’s decision reflected the intense partisanship certain to spill into the campaign to pick his successor.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.\" Walz's guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan of national prominence, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer was more succinct, issuing a statement that said in its entirety: “Good riddance.”\n\nDemocratic Governors Association Chair Andy Beshear, the second-term Kentucky governor, praised Walz as a “a national leader in fighting for the middle class” and said his organization “remains very confident Minnesotans will elect another strong Democratic governor this November.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and argued that the eventual Democratic nominee “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz, for his part, stood by his administration's stewardship.\n\n“We should be concerned about fraud in our state government,” he said, adding that “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable.” But Walz said his administration has worked diligently to address fraud and manage the state’s operations.\n\nA look at Walz's time as governor\n\nThrough nearly two terms as governor, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and close schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd's death but also stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar as she considered potential running mates in 2024 after replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "Marco Rubio was visibly irritated to be reminded that despite the capture of former president Nicolás Maduro, the dictator’s regime is still in power in Venezuela.\n\n“I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave [Maduro’s regime] intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife,” host Margaret Brennan questioned on Face the Nation Sunday, pointing out others in Maduro’s government who were indicted in the U.S.\n\n“I’m confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn’t you arrest them if you are taking out the narcoterrorist regime?” she asked.\n\n“You’re confused? I don’t know why that is confusing to you,” Rubio responded, with Brennan repeating: “They are still in power.”\n\nThe secretary of state lashed out at the CBS News host, saying that there was already enough “complaining” about the capture of just one Venezuelan politician—and that the military operation was difficult enough as it was.\n\n“You’re going to go in and suck up five people? They are already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people,” Rubio said.\n\n“We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife who is also indicted. That was a sophisticated, and frankly complicated operation.”\n\nAs Brennan agreed with the complexity of the raid, Rubio continued: “It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.\n\n“That’s not an easy mission. You’re asking me why didn’t we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that’s absurd.”\n\nRubio persisted in fawning over the operation, adding: “I do think it’s one of the most, you know, daring, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.\n\n“And today, an indicted drug trafficker—who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela, who we do not recognize, the Biden administration didn’t recognize, sixty-something countries don’t recognize, the European Union doesn’t recognize, and many countries in Latin America don’t recognize—he was an indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested, his wife was arrested—\"\n\nBrennan interjected and once again asked about the co-conspirators left behind. “Right, but the others who were also indicted are still in place, so that is the point of my questioning there. You talked about not being the legitimate president—\"\n\nRubio interrupted in turn, accusing: “So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?”\n\n“No, I’m asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. To your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president,” Brennan responded.\n\n“He was claiming to be the president,” said Rubio, speaking over Brennan again to specify: “He was the top target.”",

Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

The US has one military base, the Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.\n\n\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" Frederiksen said in her statement.\n\nThe Danish prime minister's statement comes after President Donald Trump's former aide, Katie Miller, posted an image on X of a map of Greenland superimposed with the US flag.\n\nThe Sunday post by Miller, who is married to White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was accompanied by the caption, \"SOON.\"\n\nAnd over recent years, Trump has repeatedly talked about the possibility of buying Greenland for US security and to tap into its trove of natural resources.\n\nJesper Møller Sørensen, the Danish ambassador to the US, responded to Miller's post, writing, \"Just a friendly reminder about the US and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such.\"\n\nSørensen added that he expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Sunday Facebook post, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nHe said he would not accept \"fantasies of annexation,\" and said that he found the US's messaging \"completely and utterly unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in August 2019, per a report that month by The Wall Street Journal. Greenland's foreign affairs ministry wrote in an X post in the same month, \"We're open for business, not for sale.\"\n\nIn a congressional address in March, shortly after commencing his second term, Trump said the US would take control of Greenland, \"One way or the other.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance also visited Greenland in March.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Frederiksen did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

The guest list included several top executives.\n\nAfter the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. \"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.\n\nThe relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.\n\nBefore the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies. He described himself as Trump's \"first buddy\" after the president's election win.\n\nMusk later played a central role in the administration's effort to cut government spending before leaving the post in May.\n\nTensions escalated after Musk criticized Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" prompting a public back-and-forth between the two men. Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.\n\nIn July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the \"America Party.\"\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk wrote in an X post.

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "description": "The White House has told companies they must rebuild Venezuela's crude-pumping infrastructure if they want compensation for assets seized by Caracas.",
    "fullText": "American oil companies have long hoped to recover the assets that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime ripped from them decades ago.\n\nNow the Trump administration is offering to help them achieve that aim — with one major condition.\n\nAdministration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their rigs, pipelines and other seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela now and invest heavily in reviving its shattered petroleum industry, two people familiar with the administration's outreach told POLITICO on Saturday. The outlook for Venezuela’s shattered oil infrastructure is one of the major questions following the U.S. military action that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBut people in the industry said the administration’s message has left them still leery about the difficulty of rebuilding decayed oil fields in a country where it’s not even clear who will lead the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"They're saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’\" said one industry official familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe offer has been on the table for the last 10 days, the person said. “But the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested in a televised address Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to pour big money into Venezuela.\n\n“We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,\" Trump said as he celebrated Maduro’s capture.\n\nIt’s been five decades since the Venezuelan government first nationalized the oil industry and nearly 20 years since former President Hugo Chávez expanded the asset seizures. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, but its petroleum infrastructure has decayed amid years of mismanagement and meager investment.\n\nInitial thoughts among U.S. oil industry officials and market analysts who spoke to POLITICO regarding a post-Maduro Venezuela focused more on questions than answers.\n\nThe administration has so far not laid out what its long-term plan looks like, or even if it has one, said Bob McNally, a former national security and energy adviser to President George W. Bush who now leads the energy and geopolitics consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\n“It’s not clear there’s been a specific plan beyond the principal decision that in a post-Maduro, Trump-compliant regime that the U.S. companies — energy and others — will be at the top of the list” to reenter the country, McNally said. He added: “What the regime looks like, what the plans are for getting there, that has not been fully fleshed out yet.”",

    "title": "Trump hinted at US troops guarding Venezuela's oil. Putting boots on the ground comes with high risks.",
    "description": "The US military has experience guarding oil infrastructure, but deploying troops to Venezuela comes with high risks in a dangerous environment.",
    "fullText": "On the heels of a high-stakes mission inside Venezuela's capital that captured its indicted leader to bring him to justice, President Donald Trump said his goal now was to get major US oil companies access to its huge reserves — even if it means deploying US troops.\n\n\"We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,\" Trump said in a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in reply to a question about whether the US military would have a presence there. \"So you may need something, not very much.\"\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but deploying US troops to guard its oilfields and aging infrastructure comes with high risks and costs, military experts told Business Insider, and will require a stable security environment. This kind of operation may also require congressional authorization or additional funding.\n\n\"When you put US troops into a foreign country, there is going to be some resistance unless they are invited,\" said Peter Mansoor, a retired US Army colonel and professor of military history at the Ohio State University who is an expert in counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nMansoor, who commanded a brigade in Iraq, said US operations there are instructive, showing why sending US troops into Venezuela is the \"least desirable\" option. Iraqis themselves guarded their energy infrastructure, he said, which proved quite vulnerable to attack during the insurgency: Pipelines were bombed, mortars struck an oil refinery, trucks were hijacked only to have the oil sold on black markets.\n\n\"All of those things happened in Iraq, and they could happen here too if the Venezuelans allow an insurgency to erupt,\" said Mansoor, who is also a senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at OSU.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's operations are now managed by the state-run PDVSA oil company that took on assets that had belonged to US companies. Of US oil majors, only Chevron remains.\n\nVenezuela's future production is as murky as its tar-like extra-heavy crude. This type of oil is a large part of its massive oil reserves and requires a crude upgrader process to make it easier to move, an industry analyst said.\n\n\"All of that requires a lot of upfront investment,\" said Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the University of Texas at Austin. \"So the Venezuelan oil sector presents some particular challenges. The reserves are enormous, and under the right political transition, and if a different investment regime returns, it is an opportunity that will be attractive to some companies.\"\n\nTo be sure, the US military has plenty of experience with energy infrastructure. Soldiers have patrolled near oil fields in eastern Syria. Warships and cutters guarded oil platforms off Iraq during the war and intercepted oil smugglers. A US task force more recently escorted ships, including tankers, threatened by missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nAny US military mission in Venezuela turns on a turbulent situation where it's unclear who's in charge; Trump said at the press conference that US officials would be \"running\" Venezuela for a time.\n\n\"What's unclear here is who is actually the opponent,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Do we think we're going to have to send troops to go in and seize these oil fields rather than simply having the government of Venezuela change its model for managing them? At this point, it's unclear what exactly the protection is from and who would be doing it.\"\n\n\"So jumping ahead to say that the US military is going to now be protecting a bunch of oil facilities is premature,\" Clark said.\n\nOne thing that makes this national discussion so unusual is that it's so nakedly about oil access, unlike the stated justifications for the Persian Gulf war or the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"The Trump administration has been very open about oil, even though they've tried to position this a little bit in terms of human rights,\" said Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a resident fellow at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"What remains to be seen is how much planning went into the aftermath — which of course the US has a terrible track record with.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a traitor.  “Every thought that we had in our minds, she seemed to be very good at verbalizing,” Harling said.  Saying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress.",
    "fullText": "DALTON, Ga. (AP) — President Donald Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a traitor. But for Jackie Harling, who chairs the local Republican Party in Greene’s northwestern corner of Georgia, she’s still “mama bear.”\n\n“Every thought that we had in our minds, she seemed to be very good at verbalizing,” Harling said.\n\nSaying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress. First, it was her embrace of conspiracy theories and incendiary rhetoric, turning her into a national symbol of a political culture without guardrails. Then it was her willingness to criticize Trump, a schism that made her position in Washington untenable.\n\nIn interviews in Greene’s district, constituents described her over and over as a “fighter.” For Republicans like Harling, that was enough.\n\n“We got a lot of satisfaction,” Harling said. “She was our voice.”\n\nIt was less satisfying for an independent like Heath Patterson, who struggled to think of ways that Greene's fame and notoriety made a difference for her district during her time in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“I don’t know of anything that she did do here except, certainly, got her voice heard. But where did we, how did we benefit from that?” he said. “I don’t think we did.”\n\nGreene began clashing with Trump last year, criticizing his focus on foreign policy and his reluctance to release documents involving the Jeffrey Epstein case. The president eventually had enough, saying he would support a primary challenge against her. Greene announced a week later that she would resign.\n\nShe has kept up the criticism since then, including over Trump's decision to strike Venezuela this weekend.\n\n“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end,” Greene wrote on social media on Saturday. “Boy were we wrong.”\n\nThe split was surprising because, until that point, Greene’s trajectory had mirrored Trump’s own rise to power. She didn’t become politically involved until his presidential campaign in 2016 and first ran for Congress in 2020. Greene considered trying to represent Georgia’s 6th congressional district, which includes the Atlanta suburbs, before relocating to the 14th, where the Republican incumbent was retiring.\n\nShe remained loyal to Trump after he lost to President Joe Biden, promoting his falsehoods about a stolen election. When Trump ran again in 2024, she toured the country with him and spoke at his rallies while wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nHer Georgia district is one of the most Republican-leaning in the state, although it wasn’t always that way. The region once backed Democrats like Zell Miller, a governor and U.S. senator who spearheaded Georgia’s lottery program that still bankrolls college scholarships and early childhood education programs.\n\nBut residents have felt left behind by years of change, said Jan Pourquoi, a Belgian native who emigrated in 1987, became a U.S. citizen and later won local office in Whitfield County.\n\nHis county’s population has grown by roughly by 32% since 1990, which pales in comparison to statewide growth of 74%. As the U.S. becomes more urban, secular, and diverse, Pourquoi said residents believe they’re “culturally oppressed.”\n\n“They see themselves as great Americans, proud Americans, Christian Americans, and that doesn’t fit the American model anymore as they see it,” said Pourquoi, who said he left the Republican Party because of Trump. Greene exemplified the political backlash, which he summarized as “stick it to them — any possible way you can.”\n\nGeorgia leaders, like those in many other states, have spent years drawing congressional districts to pack like-minded voters together. That means in red areas, whoever wins the Republican primary is virtually guaranteed to come out on top in the general election, incentivizing candidates like Greene with more hardline views.\n\nThe political landscape means former Republicans like Pourquoi or independents like Patterson say they have no shot at helping a centrist win.\n\n“I’m kind of square in the middle,” said Patterson, adding that it sometimes feels like he’s “the only one around here who’s that way.”\n\nRepublicans plan their path forward\n\nWhitfield County Republicans gathered at a local restaurant last month for their annual Christmas party, where seasonal decor and a visit from Santa Claus were intermingled with the red, white and blue regalia and a smattering of MAGA paraphernalia.\n\nThere was still deep affection for Greene and plenty of talk about the cultural issues she championed.\n\n“I think it’s just the fact that she was unwavering in ‘America First,’” said Gavin Swafford, who worked on Greene’s initial campaign.\n\nSwafford called her “an accountability representative” because of her clashes with Republican leaders.\n\nLisa Adams, a party volunteer, called Greene “our stand-up person.”\n\n“Look at her stance on transgenderism. That’s a big one,” she said. “Abortion. That’s a big one.”\n\nNone of Greene's inconsistencies — real or perceived — were a problem, they said.\n\nFor example, Greene has praised the Korean-owned solar panel factories in the district even after voting against Biden-era policies intended to boost production. She broke with Republicans, Trump included, and sided with Democrats who wanted to extend premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance customers.\n\nNone of the Republicans at the Christmas party expressed any interest in taking sides between Trump and Greene.\n\n“I think it’s inevitable when you have two firebrands that are both stubborn,” Swafford said.\n\nAsked whether the district missed having a more traditional lawmaker, the kind who might cut bipartisan deals and bring as much federal money as possible back home, Swafford was unconcerned.\n\n“The biggest thing that Marjorie contributed wasn’t even in legislation,\" he said.\n\nStill, there was also a sense among some that Greene, for all her bare-knuckle politics, could have gone further.\n\nStar Black, a Republican who is running to replace Greene, was already planning a primary challenge before she announced her resignation.\n\n“You had a great representative who was a fighter. Well, you know what? I want to take it one step further,” Black said.\n\n“Not only do you need a fighter,” Black said, “you need someone who is going to listen. You need someone who is going to represent you.”",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "fullText": "Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nU.S. operations on Saturday represented America’s most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nThe middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were being transported on a U.S. warship to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.\n\nProtesters gather in Los Angeles, elsewhere to protest US military action\n\nHundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela.\n\nPeople donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”\n\nA smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.\n\nAftermath of US military operation in Venezuela disrupts Caribbean travel\n\nThe U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy travel time for the region.\n\nElisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.\n\n“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said.\n\nShe spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won’t truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”\n\n“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”\n\n▶ Read more about travel disruptions here\n\nVenezuelans wonder who’s in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro’s deputy Rodríguez\n\nUncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.\n\nTrump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro’s most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump’s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”\n\n▶ Read more about the reaction within Venezuela\n\nMaduro’s ouster sparks celebrations among Venezuelans in South Florida\n\nRevelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro’s capture and removal from the country.\n\nFor some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.\n\nPeople gathered for a rally in Doral, the Miami suburb where Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent.\n\nOutside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by others hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”\n\n“We’re like everybody — it’s a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There’s fears. There’s excitement. There’s so many years that we’ve been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”\n\nBlack lawmakers in Congress condemn ‘illegal’ US actions in Venezuela\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”\n\n“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.\n\n“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.\n\nPerson in custody seen gingerly leaving plane believed to be carrying Maduro\n\nAt around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro.\n\nThe person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents.\n\nSeveral agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.\n\nCanadian PM stands by Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to build future\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people.\n\nCarney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nCarney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”\n\nSeizing control of Venezuela’s oil presents legal issues for US, law professor says\n\nMatthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”\n\nJUST IN: Plane carrying deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrives in New York following his capture by US, AP source says German leader calls for stability in Venezuela\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn’t recognize his presidency after the South American nation’s last election.\n\nMerz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.\n\nHe said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it’s important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”\n\nSchumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.\n\n“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.\n\nRubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.\n\nVenezuela's UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”\n\nThe letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.\n\n“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.\n\nTrump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump shares photo of captured Maduro\n\nThe president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”\n\nMaduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.\n\nMaduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.\n\nTrump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader\n\nTrump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nTrump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.\n\nHernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”\n\n“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.\n\nJustice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife\n\nThe indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nUN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike\n\nThe United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.\n\n“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina slams US strike in Venezuela\n\nChina strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.\n\n“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.\n\nIt called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.\n\nTrump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela\n\nTrump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.\n\n“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.\n\n“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.\n\n“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.\n\nTrump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike\n\nTrump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.\n\nHe said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”\n\n“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.\n\n“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels\n\nTrump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.\n\n“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.\n\n“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.\n\n“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.\n\n“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.\n\nMaduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP\n\nVenezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.\n\n“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”\n\nEuropean leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US\n\n— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\n\n— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility. International Law and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected,” Sánchez wrote on X.\n\n— Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely alarmed” and called for “immediate clarification,” according to a statement posted Saturday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. The ministry said such actions, if confirmed, would constitute “an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state.”\n\n— British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. was not involved in the U.S. operation in Venezuela and that he would seek more information from Trump. Without condemning the U.S. action, Starmer said he always believes that international law should be upheld. “But I think at this stage, fast moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there,” he said.\n\nUS indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges in 2020\n\nThe Justice Department during Trump’s first term in office charged in the several indictments that Maduro had effectively converted Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups as he and his allies stole billions from the South American country.\n\nThe coordinated unsealing of indictments against 14 officials and government-connected individuals, and rewards of $55 million for Maduro and four others, attacked all the key planks of what then-Attorney General William Barr called the “corrupt Venezuelan regime,” including the Maduro-dominated judiciary and the powerful armed forces.\n\nOne indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, head of the rubber-stamping constitutional assembly, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”\n\nRead our news report from 2020 on the charges\n\nRussia calls US action ‘an act of armed aggression’\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a U.S. “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday.\n\n“Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,” the statement said.\n\nThe ministry called for dialogue to prevent further escalation and said it reaffirmed its “solidarity” with the Venezuelan people and government, adding that Russia supports calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — serving out her final days before stepping down from Congress — ripped President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Venezuela.\n\nIn a post to X on Saturday, Greene lashed out at the administration justifying the move on the grounds that they were looking to combat narco-terrorism.\n\n“I’ve served on the Homeland Security Committee for the past three years,” Greene wrote. “I’m 100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America. Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of U.S. drug overdose deaths and fentanyl comes from Mexican cartels made with chemical precursors from China and trafficked across the U.S. Mexico border. Mexican cartels are primarily and overwhelmingly responsible for killing Americans with deadly drugs. If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn’t the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels? And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America? Ironically cocaine is the same drug that Venezuela primarily traffics into the U.S.”\n\nThe next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran.\n\nAnd of course why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I’m not endorsing Russia or China)\n\nThe congresswoman, in a subsequent post went on to blast the idea of ousting the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, through a military action.\n\n“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s (sic) tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene wrote. “Especially the younger generations. Boomers and half of Gen X will cheer on neocon wars and talking points, but the other half of Gen X and majority on down see through it and hate it. Americans (sic) disgust with our own government’s never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.”\n\nGreene added, “This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”\n\nAnd in a subsequent post following Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will “run” Venezuela, Greene expressed her disgust with a facepalm emoji.\n\nhttps://x.com/mtgreenee/status/2007505789108543761?s=20\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Rips Trump’s Strike on Venezuela: ‘MAGA Thought They Voted to End’ This — ‘Boy Were We Wrong’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”",
    "fullText": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”\n\nDays later, Trump administration officials privately told members of Congress much the same thing – that they lacked the legal justification to support attacks against any land targets in Venezuela.\n\nJust two months later, though, the Trump administration has done what it previously indicated it couldn’t.\n\nIt launched what Trump called a “large scale strike against Venezuela” and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, to face charges. And it launched this regime change effort without the approval of Congress.\n\n(Trump in November claimed he didn’t need congressional authorization for land action, but it clearly wasn’t the consensus view in the administration.)\n\nIt appears the mission is, for now, limited to removing Maduro. But as Trump noted, it did involve striking inside the country – the same circumstance some in the administration previously indicated required authorization that it didn’t have. CNN reported back in early November that the administration was seeking a new legal opinion from the Justice Department for such strikes.\n\nAnd Trump in a news conference Saturday spoke repeatedly about not just arresting Maduro, but also running Venezuela and taking over its oil – comments that could certainly be understood to suggest this was about more than arresting Maduro.\n\nLegally dubious strikes inside another country – even ones narrowly tailored at removing a foreign leaders – are hardly unheard of in recent American history. But even in that context, this one is remarkable.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has taken remarkably little care to offer a consistent set of justifications or a legal framework for the attack. And it doesn’t even appear to have notified Congress ahead of time, which is generally the bare minimum in such circumstances.\n\nA full explanation of the claimed justification has yet to be issued, but the early signs are characteristically confusing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said shortly after the strikes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the attack was needed to, in Lee’s words, “protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” against Maduro.\n\n“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” said Lee, a frequent critic of unauthorized foreign military action.\n\nHours later, Vice President JD Vance echoed that line.\n\n“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance said on X. “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”\n\nAt a later news conference, Rubio echoed the line that the military had been supporting “a law enforcement function.”\n\nBut there are many people living in other countries that are under indictment in the United States; it is not the US government’s usual course to launch strikes on foreign countries to bring them to justice.\n\nThe administration also hadn’t previously indicated that military force could be legally used for this reason.\n\nInitially, Trump threatened land strikes inside Venezuela to target drug traffickers – this despite Venezuela being an apparently somewhat small player in the drug-trafficking game.\n\nLater, the administration suggested strikes might be needed because Venezuela sent bad people into the United States.\n\nAnd then, after initially downplaying the role of oil in the US pressure campaign against Venezuela and Maduro, Trump said he aimed to reclaim “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”\n\nThe signals were confusing enough that even the hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in mid-December indicated the administration lacked “clarity” in its messaging.\n\n“I want clarity right here,” Graham said. “President Trump is saying his days are numbered. That seems to me that he’s gotta go. If it’s the goal of taking him out because he’s a threat to our country, then say it. And what happens next? Don’t you think most people want to know that?”\n\nDespite the focus on the law enforcement operation on Saturday, Trump at the news conference said the United States would now participate in running Venezuela, at least temporarily. And he repeatedly spoke about its oil.\n\n“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure,” Trump said, adding at another point: “We’re going to run the country right.”\n\nAnd even if the administration had offered a more consistent justification, that doesn’t mean it would be an appropriate one.\n\nThe most recent major example of using the US military for regime change is, of course, the war in Iraq. That war was authorized by Congress in 2002. The broader war on terror was authorized by Congress in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince then, administrations have sought to justify several military actions in the Middle East using those authorizations – sometimes dubiously. But Venezuela is in an entirely different theater.\n\nWhile many have compared the effort in Venezuela to Iraq, the better comparison – and one the administration apparently intends to make – is Panama in 1989.\n\nLike in Venezuela, Panama’s leader at the time, Manuel Noriega, was under US indictment, including for drug-trafficking. And like in Venezuela, the operation was less a large-scale war than a narrowly tailored effort to remove the leader from power.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1980 had concluded that the FBI didn’t have the authority to apprehend and abduct a foreign national to face justice. But George H.W. Bush administration’s OLC quietly reversed that in the summer of 1989.\n\nA memo written by William P. Barr, who would later become attorney general in that Bush administration and Trump’s first administration, said a president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, even if it violated international law to do so.\n\nThat memo was soon used to justify the operation to remove Noriega. (As it happens, Noriega was captured the same day Maduro was: January 3,1990.)\n\nBut that memo remains controversial to this day. It’s also an extraordinarily broad grant of authority, potentially allowing US military force anywhere\n\nAnd the situation in Venezuela could differ in that it’s a larger country that could prove tougher to control with its leader in foreign custody. It also has significant oil wealth, meaning other countries could take an interest in what happens there next. (China has called the attack a “blatant use of force against a sovereign state.”)\n\nIn both the news conference and an interview with Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump invoked the possibility of further military option, reinforcing that this could be about more than just arresting Maduro.\n\nThat also means the questions about Trump’s legal authorities could again be tested – just as he’s already tested them with his legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats and other actions in the region.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Trump is seeking to yet again test the limits of his authority as president – and Americans’ tolerance for it. But this time he’s doing it on one of the biggest stages yet. And the story of his stretching of the law certainly isn’t over.",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "Senators and House members accuse Trump and his aides of disregarding the Constitution and lying to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Saturday at 3:21 am, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow.”\n\nHours later, during a congratulatory press conference, Trump said that during a period of transition in Venezuela, “we’re going to run the country right.” But he gave only limited details of how the process would proceed, aside from saying, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.” Trump dwelt more on talk of prosecuting Maduro and his wife in a New York City courtroom.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had already taken to social media earlier on Saturday morning with a message :“Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nBut in a brief predawn call with a New York Times reporter, Trump refused to discuss whether “he had sought congressional authority for the operation or what is next for Venezuela.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio later acknowledged that there had been no pre-attack consultation.\n\nAs it became clear that leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees had not been consulted on the regime-change attack and as confusion mounted about what would happen next in Venezuela, key members of Congress—who have the constitutionally defined authority to declare wars and to oversee major military actions—reacted angrily to what had transpired in the name of the United States but without the consent of the legislative branch.\n\n“A US invasion of Venezuela to depose its president and arrest him is illegal,” Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told NPR Saturday morning. Kaine promised to seek a Senate vote next week to declare that Trump should not be waging this “unilateral presidentially declared war against Venezuela” without congressional authorization.\n\nKaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement arguing, “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro—however terrible he is—is a return to a day when the United States asserted a right to dominate the internal affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. The history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to the claim with a straight face to other countries should respect the United States’ sovereignty when we do not do the same.”\n\n“Where will this go next?” asked Kaine. “Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who has been one of the House’s most consistent critics of undeclared wars, warned that Trump has disregarded the Constitution. “President Trump has repeatedly been told he must consult with and get authorization from Congress to go to war, per US law. While we are only seeing early public accounts of what happened, it is clear he acted without doing that,” Pocan said. “Trump not notifying Democratic leadership, much less rank-and-file members, continues the degradation of the rule of law.”\n\nRepresentative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Military and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, said, “Trump’s regime change war in Venezuela is flat out illegal and yet another betrayal of the commitments he made to the American people. He said he’d lower prices. He’s driving prices up. He said no ‘new stupid wars.’ He’s starting new stupid wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) initially went on social media and wrote, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”\n\nLater, after receiving a call from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lee made feeble excuses for the administration, claiming that the assault “likely” was justified by fears of “an actual or imminent attack.” But Washington Post national security analyst Josh Rogan wrote, “The United States has just kidnapped a foreign head of state and bombed a foreign capital using the justification of protecting U.S. personnel from an ‘actual or imminent attack’ according to Senator Lee. Make no mistake, President Trump just committed an act of war against Venezuela.”\n\nThe New York Times adopted a similar view in an editorial headlined “Trump’s Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise.”\n\nAnd Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed claims by the president and the attorney general about the reasons for the regime change. “It’s not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world [former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández] last month. It’s about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also expressed skepticism. “If this action were constitutionally sound,” Massie wrote on X, “the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law.”\n\nMaduro, according to election observers, almost certainly lost the 2024 presidential election and then refused to step down. Yet he had recently signaled an openness to meeting with Trump to discuss US allegations about drug trafficking and other issues. Trump has now executed a secret plan to remove the Venezuelan leader, even after Trump’s aides had denied regime-change plans.\n\nSenator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama, accused Trump’s secretaries of state and defense of lying to Congress about the administration’s intensions. “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change,” Kim said in a statement amid the first reports of US air strikes on Caracas. “I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”\n\nKim explained, “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government. This will further damage our reputation—already hurt by Trump’s policies around the world—and only isolate us in a time when we need our friends and allies more than ever.”\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “We have no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war. We should have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSenator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served in the US Marines from 2002 to 2006 and was deployed during the war in Iraq, bluntly declared, “This war is illegal.” “There is no justification for the United States to be at war with Venezuela. I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” explained Gallego. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump revealed key details of the US military assault on Venezuela during a press conference on Saturday.\n\nFrom Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump addressed the operation, including the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who have been indicted by a US federal court.\n\nHere's what Trump said about the mission, the capture of the Venezuelan leader, and what comes next.\n\nTrump called the operation against Venezuelan leadership, which occurred overnight and into the early morning, \"an extraordinary military operation\" involving the use of assets and weapons across air, land, and sea domains. Other officials revealed that intelligence, space, and cyber assets were involved as well.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, involved over 150 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and drones.\n\nSome assets disabled Venezuelan defenses and provided cover, while others were involved in infiltration and extraction.\n\nThe US president said that the assault targeted \"a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas,\" where Maduro was captured during the night. He added that the US used \"certain expertise\" to turn off the lights in Caracas and that the Venezuelan military was overwhelmed by US forces.\n\nAmong the most important discussion points of the president's press conference is that the US will run Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"\n\nExactly how the Trump administration plans to do this, and for how long, remains unknown. By law, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, should assume power. Trump added that Rodríguez \"really doesn't have a choice\" but to accept US involvement.\n\nWhen speaking on who would be in charge of this plan, Trump pointed to the officials standing behind him at the conference, including Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Caine.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said, the biggest US oil companies will be going to Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The US has been seizing and blockading oil tankers in recent months as part of the escalating tension between Maduro and the Trump administration. Trump has said the US built Venezuela's oil industry and intends to take it back, accusing Caracas of using the money to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump said the US was ready to conduct a second attack, \"a much bigger wave,\" on Venezuela if needed.\n\n\"We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,\" the president said, pointing to the success of the first attack.",

At that time, it was unclear whether he intended to escalate further.\n\n\"We were going to do this four days ago, but the weather was not perfect,\" Trump said of the operation to capture Maduro during his interview with Fox on Saturday. \"We had just the perfect weather.\"\n\nThe president later said that the US is going to be strongly involved in Venezuela's oil industry moving forward.\n\nSeveral leaders of countries in the region quickly condemned the strikes in Venezuela.

    "fullText": "The US executed targeted, large-scale attacks in Venezuela's capital city, Caracas, overnight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday American forces struck the country's military, turned off the lights in the city, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for prosecution in New York.\n\nThe assault news has raised big questions. Here's what we know right now.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump revealed on Truth Social that the US military carried out a \"large-scale attack against Venezuela\" and that the leader had been captured and taken out of the country.\n\nThe US president didn't seek Congressional approval prior to the mission. Congress, however, was notified afterward.\n\nTrump told Fox News he watched the capture of Maduro play out in real time from a room inside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida alongside military generals.\n\n\"I was told by real military people that there's no other country on Earth that can do such a maneuver,\" he shared during a phone interview with Fox News. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show.\"\n\nTrump said the raid was \"extremely complex,\" more so than the Midnight Hammer operation against Iran's nuclear sites conducted last year. Maduro and his wife were taken to the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.\n\nTrump said US assets involved included land, air, and sea, including a \"massive number\" of aircraft and troops. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, was based on months of intelligence-gathering, including watching Maduro's patterns of life, and involved all elements of the joint force, from space and cyber assets to traditional combat forces.\n\nThe assault involved 150 aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, and helicopters and rotary aircraft — that provided \"layered effects\" to clear the way for the interdiction force to slip in with the \"element of surprise\" into downtown Caracas. Fighters and different drones covered the extraction.\n\nThere were no US personnel or equipment losses, Trump said; however, he did say that troops were hit, along with a helicopter that he said was hit \"pretty hard.\" Caine said the US responded to hostile fire with \"overwhelming\" force.\n\nTensions have been rising for months between Venezuela's Maduro regime and the Trump administration, which has ramped up its rhetoric while increasing military action nearby.\n\nThe US has blamed Venezuela for pushing deadly drugs into the country, as well as using its oil industry, which the Trump administration says the US built and intends to take back, to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nThe administration has labeled cartels and the Maduro regime terrorist organizations. Trump has also called Maduro an illegitimate leader.\n\nThe US has been launching attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats since September 2025, with over 100 people killed and others missing or captured.\n\nA massive US force presence, including warships and combat aircraft, has been in the Caribbean to combat narcotics trafficking and pressure Venezuela for months.\n\nMore recently, US forces began executing a blockade of oil tankers out of Venezuela in an effort to enforce American oil sanctions, hurting a key Venezuelan export and straining its economy.\n\nMaduro's government said that the purpose of the US attack on Venezuela was to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the nation's political independence.\"\n\nThe US has removed the leaders of sovereign states in the past. For instance, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, it captured Saddam Hussein after the Bush administration asserted the Iraqi president had weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was later convicted for crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court and executed in December 2006.\n\nA lack of evidence that Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction led to criticisms against the Bush administration's motives.\n\nMuch earlier, Panamanian military dictator Manual Noriega was also a target of American military forces during the US invasion of Panama from December 1989 to January 1990, partially prompted by his attempt to annul the results of the 1989 Panamanian general election. US courts had charged Noriega with drug smuggling and money laundering, and the Panamanian official was captured in January 1990 and taken to Miami, where he was convicted on most of the charges.\n\nBoth Noriega and Maduro were heads of state indicted by US federal courts, they were accused of using state power to facilitate drug trafficking, and the US could argue in both cases those actions taken against them were law enforcement.\n\nThe US has also conducted military action to kill prominent foreign figures. Exactly six years ago, US military personnel successfully assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military officer, in a drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nThe US designated Soleimani a terrorist in 2005. In response to Soleimani's assassination in January 2020, Iran launched missiles against US military bases in Iraq, injuring 110 US troops.\n\nMaduro and his wife are on their way to New York. Pamela Bondi, US attorney general, said that Maduro had been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, as well as conspiracy against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said on X.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump posted a picture of Maduro in custody on Truth Social. The photo showed Maduro aboard USS Iwo Jima.\n\nThe president also added that US oil companies would be returning to Venezuela.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's pressure campaign against Venezuela is reminiscent of the U.S.'s catastrophic invasion of Iraq, as it relies on exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats to justify its actions, potentially leading to the same disastrous consequences.",
    "fullText": "Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard rappelled from a helicopter onto the deck of the Centuries, an oil tanker that had last left port in Venezuela. It was the second Venezuelan-linked tanker detained by U.S. forces in the Caribbean in December, while a third tanker was sought by the U.S Coast Guard.\n\nThe seizures were framed as routine enforcement of sanctions. But to many observers, they looked like something else: a crude show of force that revived uncomfortable memories of how easily oil, security, and moral justification blur when Washington wants war.\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign against Venezuela, it is becoming increasingly clear that the only lessons America absorbed from its catastrophic invasion of Iraq were the wrong ones.\n\nThe White House’s deadliest error is its indulgence in motivated reasoning. Like the Bush administration before it, Trump’s administration is seemingly placing his enthusiasm for toppling a dictator over facts or strategic planning.\n\nThe administration recently labelled fentanyl a chemical “weapon of mass destruction” — echoing the falsehood that George W. Bush used to drag the U.S. into Iraq in 2003. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since accused Nicolás Maduro of working with “narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists” — reviving memories of George W. Bush’s unfounded obsession with an alliance between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.\n\nThis rhetoric comes amid allegations of human rights violations over the administration’s drone campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats from Venezuela. Last month, Trump said he was not ruling out war. It is tempting to conclude that our leaders learned nothing from Iraq. The truth is darker. They learned that exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats can still work.\n\nNow that cynical logic is being aimed at a neighbor in the Americas. Latin America is no stranger to Washington’s interventions, but recycling the rhetorical playbook of the most catastrophic blunder in modern U.S. history signals to the region — and to the world — that America remains unable, or unwilling, to control its worst instincts.\n\nPolitical memory is short, but the costs of the Iraq War were enormous. While the initial invasion was swift and militarily successful, what followed was nearly a decade of violent counterinsurgency, in which more than 4,400 American servicemembers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed — mainly civilians.\n\nYet the lesson U.S. leaders appear to have drawn is not that wars like Iraq should be rare, limited and meticulously planned. Instead, they learned that no administration remains in power forever, and that a president can claim the initial victory while leaving the eventual reckoning to a successor.\n\nIn Iraq, shamefully little attention was paid to planning for what came beyond President George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state created power vacuums that spawned and nurtured extremist pro-Saddam militias, al-Qaeda in Iraq, and eventually ISIS.\n\nThe deeper lesson was not merely that invasion breeds instability, but that ungoverned spaces accelerate extremist ideology and transnational violence.\n\nThe same dynamic could unfold in Venezuela. Latin America has a long history of insurgency, from FARC in Colombia, the Zapatistas in Mexico, and the Shining Path in Peru. Just as disbanded Ba’athist forces gravitated towards militias and terror groups after 2004, fractured Venezuelan security forces could easily be absorbed into criminal-terrorist ecosystems that already exist. Under Maduro, Venezuela has worked with Colombian guerrilla groups and illicit trafficking networks, while cultivating ties with Hezbollah.\n\nVenezuela presents some risks even greater than Iraq. The Maduro regime is recruiting and arming militias, and preparing troops for a guerrilla war.\n\nWhen Iraq collapsed and the army disbanded, al-Qaeda wasted little time in recruiting newly unemployed soldiers. It is in this space that organizations such as the Muslim World League have sought to intervene globally — not as security actors, but as religious authorities capable of challenging extremist narratives at their root.\n\nUnder the leadership of its Secretary-General, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the Muslim World League has focused on stripping violent movements of religious legitimacy by building cross-sectarian consensus against the politicization of faith. Its 2019 Charter of Makkah — endorsed by more than 1,200 Sunni, Shia, and minority-sect scholars from 139 countries — explicitly rejects religious supremacy, sectarian violence, and the use of theology to justify terror. That effort reflects lessons drawn from conflicts like Iraq, where the collapse of state authority was compounded by the absence of a shared moral framework capable of resisting extremist capture.\n\nVenezuela lacks an equivalent religious or institutional counterweight. An intervention would risk repeating Iraq’s gravest mistake: tearing down a state in an environment already primed for extremist and criminal consolidation.\n\nThe cautionary lessons that should have restrained American power are instead being rewritten as a playbook for war. The administration is selling the illusion of strength for short-term political gain, at the cost of American credibility, stability and lives.\n\nIraq should have ended this way of thinking. Venezuela suggests it never did.\n\nPaulina Velasco is chief of staff for the Los Angeles City Council and a Democratic political strategist. She is also a journalist who has been published in The Hill, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and Dallas Morning News, among others.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s habit of bragging about acing multiple cognitive tests may have accidentally confirmed everyone’s worst fears about the state of his health.\n\nAppearing on MS NOW, Dr. Vin Gupta discussed the president’s latest boast, the 79-year-old gloating yet again about scoring “100%” on a third cognitive examination in a Friday Truth Social post.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” the president wrote.\n\n“This is not the flex he thinks it is,” Gupta, medical analyst for NBC News and former chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy, said. “You don’t do this every other day and use that as evidence that you’re cognitively there.”\n\n“Those that tend to do Montreal [Cognitive Assessment Tool, or MOCA] tests with that level of frequency, usually we’re worried about the presence of early-stage dementia or cognitive impairment, so he might be ruling himself in to something that he doesn’t want to rule himself into.”\n\nThe president has faced increasing speculation surrounding his cognitive health during his second term, with multiple medical experts and Trump’s own niece suggesting that his decline is readily apparent.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner has previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that undertaking the same cognitive assessment multiple times suggests that his doctors are not assessing dementia, but monitoring it.\n\n“You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCA once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you’re giving it to him three times, that means you’re not assessing dementia. That means you’re monitoring dementia,” Gartner said.\n\nGartner has previously pointed to the president’s increasingly erratic behavior as evidence of his cognitive decline.\n\n“When people develop dementia, they become the worst versions of themselves,” he told the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles in November.\n\n“Whatever personality issues or problems [people with dementia] have begin to deteriorate and they become even more crude, disorganized, aggressive, confused versions of that personality disorder,” Gartner added.\n\nCaginess from the White House has only exacerbated speculation about the president’s health, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly declining to provide journalists or the American public with details of the president’s medical assessments.\n\nAfter the president himself blurted out in October that he had undergone an MRI during a physical examination, the White House initially declined to explain why. Eventually, in December, they claimed that it was a “preventative” measure due to his age—a claim medical experts immediately began to question.\n\n“There really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN in December. “This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging.”\n\nTrump has also regularly been seen with bruises on his hand—something the White House has blamed on frequent handshakes plus a daily aspirin regimen—and swollen ankles, likely the result of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis, both of which have added to concerns about his fitness for office, as has his seeming tendency to take naps during official meetings.\n\nIn January 2025, Trump—who regularly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office—became the oldest president to take the oath of office.\n\nIn December, he posted a lengthy rant to Truth Social in which he argued that it was “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” to discuss his health.\n\n“After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,’” he wrote in response to a wave of fresh concern about his seemingly declining health.",

The port is among the country's largest, near Caracas, but it is not used for oil operations.\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Ministry announced it was seeking a United Nations Security Council meeting to address the US strikes.\n\n\"Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the location of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was unknown, after US President Trump said they were captured and flown out of the country.\n\nThe European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas said the bloc called for restraint after the latest events in Venezuela.\n\n\"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,\" Kallas said in a post on X. \"Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected.\"\n\nThe vice president of the European Commission said she had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and that the bloc, like many other European countries, was \"closely monitoring\" the situation.\n\n\"The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority,\" she said.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei celebrated the news about the US having captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"Freedom advances,\" Milei, a staunch Trump supporter and ally, wrote in Spanish on X, reacting to a post announcing Maduro's capture. \"Long live freedom.\"\n\nGermany was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern, the German Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.\n\nThe ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team was scheduled to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nColombia is deploying military forces to the Venezuelan border, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said. The deployment comes after US strikes on the neighboring country.\n\nThe decision followed a National Security Council meeting held to discuss the US strikes.\n\nPetro condemned the strikes as an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, warning of a humanitarian crisis. He said support forces will also be deployed to the border in the event of an influx of asylum seekers.\n\nSpain has offered to mediate for a \"peaceful solution\" in Venezuela in reaction to the US strikes.\n\nThe Spanish Foreign Ministry called in a statement for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in Venezuela.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared \"a new dawn for Venezuela\" after US strikes on the country and the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"The tyrant is gone.

This is the same force that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the so-called Islamic State, in 2019.\n\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday that the US had \"successfully\" carried out what he called a \"large-scale\" strike against Venezuela.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

Instead, Roberts offered milquetoast musings on America’s legal history, determined to avoid any reference to events after the mid-19th century. 2025? Didn’t even happen! Ostensibly, Roberts wants his stroll down memory lane to emphasize this coming summer’s semiquincentennial.",

    "fullText": "2025 was supposed to be a big year for American manufacturing.\n\nIndeed, boosting US-made goods was a key priority of President Donald Trump's trade war, which led to wild swings in tariff rates on imported products.\n\nNearly a year later, the actual changes to consumer behavior aren't entirely clear.\n\nFor starters, many retailers worked quickly to order merchandise ahead of tariff deadlines and found alternate sources of comparable goods to secure lower duties.\n\nA particular challenge for brands that manufacture products in the US is that many still rely on imported materials or equipment, which have seen cost increases related to tariffs.\n\nOne entrepreneur who wanted to make a better grill scrubber discovered firsthand how hard — and expensive — it was to make a product entirely with an exclusively American supply chain.\n\nAnother gave shoppers the choice between otherwise identical shower heads: an imported version and an American-made one that cost nearly twice as much. No one bought the higher-priced product.\n\nOf course, neither industrial nor consumer behaviors change overnight.\n\nWith enough time and investment, some CEOs believe US manufacturing can make a comeback.\n\nAs things stand now, however, tariffs have largely settled at an average rate of around 15%, and consumers appear to be reluctantly accepting the higher prices. There's also the issue of unresolved legal challenges to much of Trump's authority to apply many of the tariffs that he did.\n\nSo, as a new year begins, will shoppers choose more American-made products, and will that be enough to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing?\n\nTake our survey to help us find out.",

Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.\n\nThe White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.\n\nBeijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders’ strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance” in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would “further deepen the friendly relations” between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.\n\nTakaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nThe two exchanged views “mainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.\n\nChina's military drills off Taiwan also came after the Trump administration announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion. If approved by Congress, it would represent the largest such aid to the island ever — a move criticized sharply by China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to seize it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter any attack from the mainland.\n\nTrump on Monday said he was not informed of the exercises in advance but still touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October, shortly after she took office. The two exchanged warm words, and Trump took her with him when he spoke to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan.\n\nAfter Takaichi's Taiwan comments angered Beijing, Trump called her and said they were “extremely good friends” and that she should call him any time, according to the Japanese leader, without disclosing if the two talked about her remarks.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

    "fullText": "After President Donald Trump expanded the travel ban he put in place during his first term in the White House to 20 more countries and the Palestinian Authority last December, at least three other nations responded in turn with visa bans for Americans.\n\nOn Dec. 26, the West African nation of Niger announced that it was \"completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States.\"\n\nAfter it was included in the list of countries whose citizens are completely banned from entering the U.S. last June, the government of Chad similarly announced that it was acting upon \"principles of reciprocity and suspend[ing] the granting of visas to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nAs of January 2026, 39 countries now face either a full travel ban or restrictions on various types of visas for entering the United States.\n\nThe latest country to respond is the West African nation of Burkina Faso. A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

    "description": "The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.  The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.  “This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nThe complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.\n\n“This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Postal Service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.\n\nFor instance, the Postal Service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
