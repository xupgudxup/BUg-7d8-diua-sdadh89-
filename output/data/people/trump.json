    "fullText": "President Donald Trump had a change of heart on tariffs after meeting with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, where he shared an anecdote about his decision to lower the tariff rate on Swiss imports from the 39% he proposed in July. He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level. Doesn't mean it's not going up, but we brought it down to a lower level,\" Trump said.\n\nSome US watch sellers have said higher tariff rates could lead Swiss watchmakers to raise prices, which could affect consumers.\n\nRolex didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSwiss business leaders met with Trump last year to discuss the tariffs, and Rolex left him with a desk clock modeled after one of its iconic watches, watch publication Hodinkee reported.\n\nTrump had kind words for Swiss watchmakers at Davos.\n\n\"They make beautiful watches, great watches, Rolex, all of them,\" he said.",

    "title": "Trump's Davos speech put affordability front and center. Here's what the data says.",
    "description": "From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump touted his affordability agenda at Davos. The numbers are a mixed bag.",
    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "fullText": "If President Donald Trump gets his way on credit cards, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicts chaos — but more on the streets of American towns than in the walls of his own bank.\n\n\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said when asked about President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest rates. \"And I'm not making that up because of our business, we would survive it, by the way. In the worst case, you would have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans. Dimon proposed that the government test the proposal by forcing all the banks in Vermont and Massachusetts to comply, \"and then see what happens,\" causing a ripple of laughter through the audience.\n\n\"The people crying most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said, adding that those hurt will include restaurants, retailers, travel companies, and municipalities, \"because people will miss their water payments.\"\n\nWhatever the president and Congress decide, JPMorgan will \"deal with it,\" Dimon said. He promised that the bank would provide more extensive analysis of the potential effects, and said that he, too, wants greater affordability.\n\nDimon struck a largely conciliatory tone when asked about some of Trump's geopolitical moves — immigration and NATO, for example — which he called \"more qualitative, how it's going to work, what are the pieces, what's their intent.\" But he said he understands the card issue deeply and has a responsibility, of sorts, to speak up.\n\nDimon, like many other big-bank CEOs and business leaders, has previously said that reducing card interest rates could harm customers with lower credit scores. JPMorgan's CFO warned during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call last week that enacting price controls could \"make it no longer a good business.\"",

Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

Building enough housing to accommodate demand in markets across the US will take many years and require significant action on the state and local levels.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday cracking down on major investors in homes and asked Congress to pass legislation banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying houses.\n\n\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations, and America will not become a nation of renters,\" Trump said in Davos.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nBut these mega landlords own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, they've slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. The evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, previously told Business Insider that the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nIn Truth Social posts earlier this month, Trump announced that he had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to drive down mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates have since fallen. But industry experts said the impact of the move would likely be somewhat short-term and overshadowed by the ongoing housing shortage and moves by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump didn't provide further details on a plan at Davos, which was teased last week, that would enable Americans to pull from their 401(k)s to make a down payment on a home.\n\nThe proposal was first announced by Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Fox Business last week. \"Suppose that you put 10% down on a home, and then you take 10% of the equity of the home and put it in as an asset in your 401(k). Then your 401(k) will grow over time,\" Hassett told the network.\n\nMona Mahajan, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones, said at the time that the plan may be a good step in the right direction if it gets people thinking about diversifying their asset classes and investing earlier in their careers and home ownership journeys.\n\nUnder current tax code rules, first-time homebuyers have to pay a 10% penalty on withdrawing money before the age of 59 ½ from a 401(k) for a home purchase, with the exception of hardship withdrawals or disability reasons. Over the past few years, Congress has allowed people subject to natural disasters and terminal illnesses to withdraw money from their 401(k)s without penalties.\n\nFor IRAs, they can draw up to $10,000 penalty-free but have to pay income tax.\n\nFinancial experts often discourage people from taking out 401(k) loans for reasons such as a home purchase, as doing so could lead to lost growth opportunities, though workers who do so pay themselves with interest.\n\nIt's unclear whether this plan could have legs in Congress, as it would likely require changes to the tax code.\n\nAnother set of ideas that Trump didn't expand on in Davos involves changes to mortgages themselves.\n\nIn November 2025, Trump and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, said the administration was exploring a 50-year mortgage option and ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages.\n\nThe idea of a half-century-old mortgage has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that while 50-year loans would mean lower monthly payments, they would entail much higher interest costs for homeowners over the life of the loan and a much longer road to building equity.\n\nPulte also said the administration was \"actively evaluating\" so-called portable mortgages. These loans would enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property.\n\nHousing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up by empowering repeat buyers to spend more.\n\n\"Financing is not the solution,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, previously told Business Insider. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products — it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\"",

    "fullText": "The \"Sell America\" trade could get worse if global investors are further shaken by Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.\n\nKatie Koch, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and the CEO of the $200 billion asset manager TCW Group, said she thinks investors could be on the verge of \"quiet quitting\" the US bond market.\n\nThat's because many foreign investors feel they're overexposed to the US and are wary of some of the President's new policies — like Trump's threat to slap a 10% tariff on European nations if Greenland isn't up for sale within the next few weeks, she suggested, citing her conversations with other asset managers at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe shift away from the US could happen quietly, Koch said, as investors looking to unwind their positions won't \"scream it from the rooftops.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see some quiet quitting of the US bond market, and that I'm worried about,\" Koch said, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines at Davos Tuesday. \"I expect that investors will continue to look to diversify,\" she later added.\n\n\"Sell America\" has been a lingering concern for investors over the past year as markets have taken in Trump's ambitious tariff and geopolitical plans. The worry is that policy uncertainty and fears of higher inflation and rising deficits could cause more investors to dump US assets, a move that, in the bond market, could cause rates to rise as a higher yield is needed to entice investors.\n\nMarkets already saw a \"Sell USA\" day on Tuesday, Koch said, referring to the steep sell-off in US equities and government bonds as investors sought to reduce their exposure to the US. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term interest rates in the economy, jumped 5 basis points.\n\nBonds from countries like Japan, Europe, and various emerging markets now look more attractive for bond investors than US Treasurys, Koch added.\n\nOther market commentators have their eye on how the bond market could react to Trump's policy changes. Bond vigilantes — investors who protest what they see as negative developments in the market by selling Treasurys to drive up yields — threw a major tantrum about the president's Liberation Day tariffs last year, a move that ultimately prompted Trump to walk back many of his tariff threats.\n\nA bigger sell-off in Treasurys could be prompted if the \"sell America\" gains more traction, Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"The administration's goal is to have lower interest rates to aid US households and businesses, which is hard to achieve if bond vigilantes send rates on the long-end of the yield curve higher,\" Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research, wrote in a client note.",

    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "title": "Calls to invoke 25th Amendment grow as Trump tries to acquire Greenland. How does it work, and has it been used before?",
    "description": "The president's unusual text message to Norway's prime minister has prompted growing calls from lawmakers for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.",
    "fullText": "A growing number of lawmakers are calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office after Trump told Norway’s prime minister that his position on purchasing Greenland is tied to not winning the Nobel Peace Prize and he no longer feels obligated to “think purely of Peace.”\n\nThe remarkable exchange happened on Jan. 18, when the Norwegian leader, Jonas Gahr Store, sent a text message to Trump on behalf of himself and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb. The European leaders sent the message in an attempt to “deescalate” the increased conflict over Greenland and the latest tariff threat against the U.S.’s European allies.\n\nIn less than half an hour, Trump responded, writing, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government, but rather the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The five members of the committee are appointed by the country’s parliament.\n\nTrump doubled down on his intentions to “purchase” Greenland, writing, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!” and signing it “President DJT.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts is one of several members of Congress to call for Trump’s removal from office using the 25th Amendment. “Invoke the 25th Amendment,” Markey posted on X, along with a picture of a news headline of Trump’s unusual text message with Store. Additional Democratic House members, such as Reps. Eric Swalwell, Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Yassamin Ansari, have also called for the removal of Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment.\n\nIt dates back to 1963, when Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. There was no plan in place to choose Johnson’s replacement, and there was concern about the procedure if he were to become ill or incapacitated before a new vice president could be named. In 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and it became part of the Constitution in February 1967.\n\nThe 25th Amendment has four sections. The first three clarify the presidential order of succession and who can temporarily assume the president’s duties. Section 4 gets the most attention: It’s a multi-step process for the vice president and the Cabinet to declare that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nInvoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment would require Vice President JD Vance and the majority of Trump’s Cabinet to submit a declaration to Congress that Trump isn’t able to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Doing so would mean an immediate transfer of presidential power to Vance, who would serve as acting president. Trump would have the chance to refute the declaration, which could then be challenged by his Cabinet. Congress would have 21 days from the date of receiving the declaration to formally approve any decision to remove Trump from office.\n\nA two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed in order for Trump to be removed from office. Otherwise, he would regain his presidential powers.\n\nThe first section of the 25th Amendment was invoked when Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974 and was replaced by his vice president, Gerald Ford. Section 2 was used when Gerald Ford, as president, nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, and he was confirmed in the House and the Senate.\n\nSection 3 was used in 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent brief cancer surgery and Vice President George H.W. Bush assumed his responsibilities. In 2002 and 2007, George W. Bush invoked Section 3 when he underwent medical procedures, and then-Vice President Dick Cheney became acting president.\n\nSection 4 has never been used because the process is so challenging. It’s more difficult to remove a president under the 25th Amendment using Section 4 than under the impeachment process.\n\nThe purpose of seeking impeachment to remove a president from office is to address potential “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nThe House would require a simple majority to vote on Articles of Impeachment, which are formal written charges against a president. After a trial, the Senate would vote on whether to convict and remove the president from office, which requires a two-thirds vote. The Senate can vote in a separate proceeding to ban the president from holding future office, which would require a simple majority vote.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. The first time was on Dec. 18, 2019, for initiating foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, and the second was on Jan. 13, 2021, following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate and remained in office.\n\nShould the movement grow to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump due to incapacity or inability to perform presidential duties, invoking it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The president would not be barred from holding future office.",

While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

    "description": "Aviaja Fontain is worried that generational trauma will continue in Greenland if the US acquires the territory, which is under the Kingdom of Denmark.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aviaja Fontain, a 40-year-old mother born and raised in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Greenland, a territory under the Kingdom of Denmark with a population of around 56,000. Trump said he will impose new tariffs on several European countries, including Denmark, until a deal is reached. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI kept on looking toward the harbor to see if the US Navy was here after Trump raided Venezuela.\n\nThe first few days after the raid, of course, it was scary. I felt like we were all just waiting to get invaded. I kept on looking at the airplanes to see if they were American soldiers.\n\nI'm seeing more Danish officers coming to Greenland now, and they're training in the Arctic or near Nuuk. It feels weird. We're not used to it.\n\nI keep telling myself Trump doesn't have any legal right to annex Greenland because I don't want to be scared. I was going to orchestrate a demonstration in protest, but I'm in school and my exams were taking too much time.\n\nI know Trump says he will treat us with respect, but I don't believe him. He needs to leave Greenland and Greenlanders alone.\n\nMany of us Greenlanders love nature very much, so it's important to us that we can walk in the mountains, where it's so peaceful and quiet. I fear that Trump will try to take over Greenland, search for rare minerals and oil, and all of that will disappear.\n\nWe just want our land to be peaceful. No one is fighting for security, minerals, or anything. We are people. We have rights. We have a culture. You can't just take that and buy it.\n\nThere is generational trauma from when we were first colonized by Denmark. If we're going to be colonized by the US, then there's going to be more generational trauma. What is going to happen with our kids in the future?\n\nMy son said that if something were to happen, he would fight for his country and his fellow Greenlanders. He is 19.\n\nIf it really happens, if the US annexes Greenland, maybe I will have to flee the capital, but I told my mom, \"I don't think I will ever leave Nuuk because we have lived here most of our lives.\"\n\nI think all of us want independence from Denmark, but when we are ready. Maybe in my lifetime. You never know what will happen in the future.\n\nIn response, the White House's Deputy Press Secretary, Anna Kelly, told Business Insider in an email that President Trump's ideas are about bolstering US national security.\n\n\"Many of this President's predecessors recognized the strategic logic of acquiring Greenland, but only President Trump has had the courage to pursue this seriously. As the President said, NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States, and Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,\" Kelly wrote.",

    "title": "Who is Lisa Cook? Meet the Federal Reserve governor whose future is in the hands of the Supreme Court",
    "description": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook was at the center of Donald Trump's pressure campaign until Jerome Powell said he was under investigation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's future was already set before the Supreme Court. Then the Justice Department sent subpoenas to the central bank.\n\nWith a criminal investigation hanging over the Fed, Wednesday's oral arguments are shaping up to be a prelude to a potential historic ruling.\n\nThe White House has said it had no role in the subpoenas. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is expected to be in attendance, has portrayed the investigation as part of a retribution campaign — an argument Cook herself made when Trump tried to fire her in August 2025.\n\nHere's how Cook found herself at the center of a legal showdown with Trump.\n\nLisa DeNell Cook was born in 1964 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Her father, Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain at Central State Hospital. Mary Murray Cook, her mother, was a nurse and the first African-American tenured faculty member at Georgia College and State University.\n\nCook and her sisters were among the first Black students to integrate into local schools. She has said she has scars from when students beat her.\n\n\"I still have scars from that — scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,\" Cook told NPR in 2020.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement runs throughout Cook's family. Cook's cousin, Floyd McKissick Sr., helped organize the March on Washington.\n\nHer uncle, Samuel DuBois Cook, was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr. at Morehouse College. In 1966, DuBois Cook became the first Black professor to hold a regular appointment at a white Southern university when he accepted a position at Duke, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford.\n\n\"He instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better,\" Cook said, praising her uncle and a host of relatives in April 2024 when she accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Duke University center that bears her uncle's name.\n\nIn 1986, Cook graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and physics from Spelman College, a historically Black, all-women's university. While at Spelman, Cook became the first Spelman student to win the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.\n\nTwo years later, Cook added a BA in philosophy, politics, and economics from the University of Oxford. Cook also studied at the Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Senegal. In 2020, she told Finance & Development, the International Monetary Fund's magazine, that a chance encounter while studying in Senegal pushed her into the field of economics.\n\nShe later earned her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Her dissertation was on \"External and Internal Credit Markets in Tsarist and Post-Soviet Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Cook to the Federal Reserve. At the time, Democrats narrowly controlled the US Senate. While Federal Reserve nominees are often confirmed with broad, bipartisan support, Cook's nomination faced significant opposition.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who at the time was the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said she was \"grossly unqualified\" to serve on the central bank due to her lack of monetary policy experience.\n\n\"Professor Cook's record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the Fed's work — at a time when we need the Fed focused on fighting inflation,\" Toomey said.\n\nThen-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, who led the Senate Banking Committee, said that Cook was \"extremely qualified.\"\n\n\"A small but loud minority have wrongly claimed that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the standards for this position — standards that only seem to apply for certain nominees,\" Brown said in 2022. \"Still, she has met and exceeded all of those high bars: she's a Ph.D. economist, she is a tenured professor, and she is sought by organizations around the world for her input and perspective.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Cook. Soon after, Cook became the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board in its over 100-year history. She continues to hold this distinction.\n\nIn May 2023, Biden renominated Cook for a full term that lasts until 2038. She was reconfirmed by a 51-47 vote.\n\nIn August 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Justice Department. In a letter to the DOJ, Pulte said he took allegations of mortgage fraud \"very seriously.\" An outspoken critic of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Pulte has repeatedly said that his investigation into Cook is not connected to his criticism of the central bank.\n\nOn August 20, Trump called on Cook to resign. Five days later, Trump publicly posted a letter to Cook saying that he was firing her — the first time in history a president had tried to fire a member of the central bank.\n\nPulte said that Cook indicated that two separate properties she purchased around the same time were both her primary residence. In his letter, Trump cited the allegations as sufficient reason to fire Cook for cause. In a legal filing, Cook's attorneys explicitly denied that she ever committed mortgage fraud.\n\n\"Setting aside the fact that Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud, any such pre-office offense plainly would not have been 'so infamous a nature, as to render the offender unfit to execute any public franchise,'\" the attorneys wrote in a filing earlier this month.\n\nCook's lawyers have also said that the president did not give her sufficient time to respond to Pulte's allegations before her attempted firing.\n\nOn September 9, US District Judge Jia Cobb moved to grant Cook's request to temporarily block Trump's firing.\n\n\"The best reading of the 'for cause' provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a Governor's behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,\" Cobb wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the ruling, seeking to immediately remove Cook as the case continues to unfold. The Supreme Court ruled in October that Cook can remain on the job, pending oral arguments.\n\n\"The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order,\" Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen said in a statement.\n\nTrump still could win the final battle after justices hear the case next year, a position the White House holds.\n\n\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"\n\nThe Fed initially tried to stay out of the dispute. A lawyer for the central bank wrote in a court filing in August that it simply wanted a quick resolution.\n\n\"At this time, the Board merely expresses (1) its interest in a prompt ruling by this Court to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty; and (2) its intent to follow any order this Court issues,\" Joshua P. Chadwick, assistant general counsel for the Fed, said in a court filing.\n\nCook continued to participate in Fed meetings before her case reached the justices, including casting votes on interest rate cuts. Cook's lawyers pointed out that she will likely participate in at least one more Federal Open Market Committee before the Supreme Court issues its ruling.\n\n\"That the status quo has been maintained for months without any apparent problem only confirms that the public interest favors allowing Governor Cook to retain her office while this suit proceeds,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in a November filing.",

    "title": "Trump's workplace harassment fighters are taking on a big new target",
    "description": "The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission has a new focus: White men.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Andrea Lucas, the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, posted a video to X asking an unusual question: \"Are you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex?\" she says to the camera. \"The EEOC is committed to identifying, attacking, and eliminating all forms of race and sex discrimination — including against white male applicants and employees.\"\n\nThe video has been viewed nearly 6 million times, with top comments heaping praise. \"This message gave me hope because I did not think this was ever possible to happen to me in America,\" one user wrote. The video wasn't announcing a new policy; white men have been protected from discrimination just as people of any race or gender under the law. But it capped a year of sweeping efforts to align the bipartisan, independent EEOC with President Donald Trump's culture war on \"woke.\"\n\nThe yearlong campaign began when the president quickly ousted two of the three Democrats on the EEOC last January, leaving it without a quorum for months. The commission also paused processing charges related to gender identity and sexuality for nearly five months; it resumed them with a focus on hiring, firing, and promotions and under heightened scrutiny. Following an executive order from Trump, the EEOC ceased investigating what are known as disparate impact cases, which take on policies that appear neutral on the surface yet can still be discriminatory if they unfairly limit certain groups (a height requirement for a job, say). And in late December, the EEOC filed a request to rescind guidance on harassment that it had published in 2024, which it will vote on this Thursday. EEO Leaders, a group that includes former EEOC officials, said the request is part of the Trump administration's efforts to attack anti-discrimination laws and create confusion around federal laws that bar gender- and sexuality-based harassment. \"It is yet another salvo in this administration's prolonged attack on LGBTQI+ people,\" the group said in a public statement.\n\nNow, Trump's campaign promise to fight an \"anti-white feeling\" in America has materialized at the EEOC. Lucas, who was installed formally as chair in November, told Reuters last month it is her goal to \"shift to a conservative view of civil rights,\" which includes inquiries into DEI programs that the administration argues can discriminate against white men and religious liberty issues. Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender equity in workplaces and schools, says it's an effort underway to \"remake the EEOC in Trump's image.\"\n\nLegal experts I spoke to for this story noted that white men can be subjected to race- or gender-based discrimination, while racial minorities and women are more likely to report discrimination at work. A University of Massachusetts, Amherst analysis of EEOC charges between 2012 and 2016 found that about five in 100,000 male workers filed charges for sex discrimination, and 1 in 100,000 white workers filed charges for racial discrimination. For Black people, that figure jumps to 195 for every 100,000 workers. An analysis of EEOC data from the National Women's Law Center found that during fiscal year 2016, nearly 7,000 sexual harassment charges were filed, 82% from women. \"There is no evidence that there is such overwhelming discrimination against white men that the very, very limited resources of the EEOC should be directed in that direction,\" Vagins says.\n\nCcreated in 1965, the EEOC investigates claims of workplace discrimination and is the primary enforcer of workplace protections codified by the Civil Rights Act. In 2024, the commission won some $700 million for workers through settlements and litigation, often for minority workers who have faced disproportionate discrimination.\n\nAfter the racial and gender reckonings of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, many companies went all-in on public statements cheering diversity and launched DEI programs. Claims that men had become the victims left out of inclusion programs followed. Half of men ages 18 to 29 believe there is \"some\" or \"a lot\" of discrimination against men in the US, according to the Survey Center on American Life, up from about a third in 2019. Trump told The New York Times this month that he believes \"white people were very badly treated\" following the passage of the Civil Rights Act 60 years ago. He added: \"It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people — people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job. So it was, it was a reverse discrimination.\"\n\nWhite men hold an overwhelming majority of CEO roles at Fortune 500 companies. Last year, the gender pay gap widened for a second year in a row. Workplace discrimination and harassment is underreported, but experts tell me that it's difficult to say white men in particular are missing at high rates from the data. A survey of federal workers found that about a third of white men said they have experienced harassment, like bullying or physical intimidation, at work; those who had were more likely than other white men to see systemic race and gender bias at work, and to take action in reporting incidents of bias against their colleagues, according to a University of Michigan study in 2023. There's been little time to see the long-term effects of post-2020 DEI efforts. A Wall Street Journal analysis of 13 million jobs found that the largest public companies' workforces became slightly less white, with Asian and Hispanic workers gaining ground, while half of all senior management roles still belonged to white men. A 2025 Stanford University study that examined how companies hired after facing a DEI-related controversy found that large firms made small changes, increasing the hiring of women and people of color at about 0.8% — mostly into junior positions.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that plaintiffs of a majority class, like white or straight people, do not have to meet a higher standard of proof than minorities to win discrimination cases, and the EEOC callout to white men could bring in more cases that were previously unreported. Legal experts I spoke to characterized the video as \"clumsy,\" \"inappropriate,\" and unprecedented, since the EEOC hasn't historically solicited complaints from specific protected classes over others. (The EEOC did not respond to questions I sent for this story). The shift in messaging doesn't mean that other groups are less entitled to fighting workplace discrimination. \"It is a lot of shock and awe, smoke and mirrors, distraction,\" says Nance Schick, an employment attorney and workplace mediator. \"But the law hasn't changed.\"\n\nAs the EEOC looks to take on issues affecting white men, corporate mentor programs that focus on women or people of color could become targets, if they exclude white men from similar mentorship opportunities, legal experts say. In the video, Lucas directs viewers to an EEOC webpage focused on discrimination related to DEI, which it says is \"a broad term that is not defined in the statute.\" She adds that such programs could be illegal if they take any employment action motivated by a worker's gender, sex, or other protected characteristics. The specter of legal action could lead more companies to abandon DEI efforts. With the mounting attacks on DEI, companies must carefully review and audit their DEI programs, which is costly in time and resources, Nonnie Shivers, co-chair of the DEI compliance practice group for law firm Ogletree Deakins.\n\nIn March, the EEOC sent letters to 20 law firms seeking details about their DEI policies. Companies like Target and Amazon immediately scrapped all or parts of their DEI programs as Trump took office. The sudden shifts with the EEOC aren't changes to discrimination law, experts told me. \"Employers should not reflexively comply with unreasonable demands that are not supported by the law,\" says Jenny Yang, a former EEOC commissioner. Companies should \"do their own analysis of the law and the risks,\" she says. \"If they reflexively pull back on important equal opportunity efforts, their workforce will suffer and they could start seeing discrimination complaints from many different groups.\"\n\nThe dropping of disparate impact cases could also shift the type of investigations conducted by the EEOC. These complaints can take the form of barring people with criminal history from jobs unrelated to their convictions, or seemingly standardized tests that may not be so standard across races. They focus on ways that systemic requirements can disproportionately help or hurt groups. They're also vital for evaluating how AI is used in hiring, Yang says, which have been shown to repeat human biases in selecting some resumes over others, like knocking applicants who may have interrupted work histories (resume gaps tend to be more common among women who leave the workforce to care for children). \"The tension here is that it is often difficult to prove intentional discrimination,\" Yang says. \"Discrimination can manifest in much more subtle and complex ways, which disparate impact is important to demonstrate.\"\n\nFor workers subjected to discrimination — all of them, not just white men — there are still protections. \"It remains incredibly critical for employers to update their training modules to be maximally inclusive with examples, quizzes, questions, and other materials to understand the broad nature of the law protecting everyone.\" says Shivers. Whether the EEOC's campaign will uncover wide-ranging discrimination against white men remains to be seen. But Lucas's video leaves no doubt about the direction the EEOC is heading in this year.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "President Trump called the UK's decision to give away the Chagos Islands \"an act of great stupidity\" and a reason for the US to acquire Greenland.",
    "fullText": "That is what President Donald Trump called the UK's decision to give away a group of islands where a strategic military base is located.\n\nThe Diego Garcia military base is a cornerstone of US and allied power projection across the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. As the UK moves to transfer sovereignty of the islands, its strategic importance has turned the base into a political and diplomatic flash point.\n\nThe island's strategic location has long made it especially valuable for US military operations, including long-range bomber missions and naval deployments — a role underscored by satellite images last year showing US bombers operating from the base.\n\nLocated in the Chagos Islands, Diego Garcia became the site of a US-UK military installation after Britain forcibly removed the native Chagossian people in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seven years ago, in 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the removals were unlawful and said that the UK should relinquish control of the islands.\n\nThe UK has since reached a deal to transfer the sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, near Madagascar, while allowing Diego Garcia to remain under British control on a 99-year lease, with an option to renew. The arrangement is expected to cost the UK about $136 million a year.\n\nThe UK government's decision was previously praised by the Trump administration as a \"monumental achievement\" that secured \"the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"\n\nTrump's assessment appears to have shifted.\n\n\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday.\n\nHe said there was \"no doubt\" that Russia and China had \"noticed this act of total weakness,\" arguing that the UK \"giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.\"\n\nHe stressed that the move \"is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump has been increasingly focused on taking control of Greenland lately. He has argued its needed for Golden Dome, among other reasons.\n\nThe British prime minister's office told the BBC that \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year,\" adding that the Five Eyes intelligence agencies also approved of the transfer.\n\nTrump said at the White House later on Tuesday that the deal had changed from its original format. \"I think they should keep it,\" he said.\n\nDiego Garcia has been a secretive military installation for the US and UK since the early 1970s. It's extremely remote, far from nearby landmasses, and strategically placed so that the US and UK have air power and maritime reach from the Indian Ocean toward the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Africa.\n\nThe base hosts units from the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as the UK Royal Navy. Due to its geographical location, Diego Garcia is also critical for refueling operations for military aircraft and vessels. American bombers, such as B-1 Lancers, B-2 Spirits, and B-52 Stratofortresses, have been seen at the base, as well as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom Diego Garcia, US bombers launched attacks in Afghanistan after 9/11 and against Iraq during the 2003 invasion. And in 1991, the installation was central to US attacks during the first Gulf War. The base was crucial to the logistics operations supporting Middle Eastern missions, keeping aircraft nearby and operational.\n\nThe B-2 bomber holding the record for the longest bombing run in history landed at Diego Garcia after flying over 44 hours from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in 2001.\n\nIn June 2025, prior to US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, or Operation Midnight Hammer, experts speculated that a significant B-2 bomber presence spotted at Diego Garcia could be involved in some sort of strike on Iran. Imagery at the time showed a notable force posture there. The actual strike, however, involved a B-2 bomber task force that flew out of the US.",

We'll share real-time updates on what he says and how World Economic Forum attendees react.\n\nAfter an issue with Air Force One, Trump landed in Switzerland on a replacement plane just after 12:30 p.m. local time, and is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m.\n\nFollow along here for real-time updates, reaction, and on-the-ground commentary from Business Insider's staff in Davos.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has always had a showman's flair for conjuring attention and anticipation, and his Davos address is no different. No less than the future of NATO is at stake.\n\nOutside the auditorium where Trump will speak this afternoon, attendees told me they had no idea what he would say, so they came here to find out, especially what he says about Greenland.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has always had a showman's flair for conjuring attention and anticipation, and his Davos address is no different. No less than the future of NATO is at stake.\n\nOutside the auditorium where Trump will speak this afternoon, attendees told me they had no idea what he would say, so they came here to find out, especially what he says about Greenland.\n\nSeveral also mentioned they had never seen Trump speak in person since he appeared via video last year.\n\n\"I'm very curious,\" said one attendee.\n\n\"At least it will be entertaining,\" said another.\n\n\"I just want to see where his mind goes,\" said someone else.\n\nTrump had to switch airplanes due to electrical issues, so part of the mystery is what time he will take the stage. Security guards cleared Congress Hall after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrapped up around noon.\n\nWhile waiting to go back in to hear Trump, attendees, including financier Anthony Scaramucci and University of California chief investment officer, Jagdeep Singh Bachher, could be seen sipping coffee and eating saffron risotto Milanese.\n\nA French journalist approached me to ask whether Trump's threats were real. I told her I didn't know.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\nAway from hype about Trump's arrival, Davos is still carrying on as normal.\n\nOn a panel this morning, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang described AI as the biggest infrastructure buildout in human history — and one he sees creating a jobs boom for those with the right skillset.\n\n\"It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,\" he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.\n\nHuang said the US was seeing a \"significant boom\" in this area, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. \"So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that,\" added Huang.\n\n\"Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.\"\n\nAir Force Two touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two.\n\nAir Force Two touched down in Zurich at 12:35 p.m. local time after an eventful journey.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's original airplane departed about 10 hours ago, but it turned around due to a \"minor electrical issue.\" He has instead flown to Switzerland on a Boeing C-32A, which is typically used for the Vice President's Air Force Two.\n\nHis journey has taken over three hours longer than first expected. Now, there's another 75 miles to reach Davos, most likely by helicopter.\n\nCongress Hall is now being cleared ahead of President Donald Trump's speech.\n\nOne security guard told me the speech would be on time despite the electrical problems on AF1, but we still haven't heard official word from WEF.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns. His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right. We need to defend the Arctic,\" as China and Russia increase their presence there, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a Wednesday morning appearance at Davos.\n\nAs Trump seeks Greenland, insisting that it's key for protection against Russia and China, his allies don't actually disagree with his security concerns.

He expects tensions with the US to de-escalate, \"I think at the end of the day, we'll find an off-ramp on this.\"\n\nAfter an electrical issue on Air Force One delayed the president overnight, a replacement plane, a Boeing C-32A, was scrambled into action to bring him to Europe.\n\nAs of around midday Swiss time, the jet, a modified Boeing 757 often used as Air Force Two, was still in the air, flying close to Paris and heading for Zurich airport, where it looks likely to land within the next hour.\n\nIf, like many high-profile World Economic Forum attendees, Trump travels by helicopter from Zurich airport, it would take about another 30 to 40 minutes to reach Davos.\n\nThat could put him in the Swiss Alps just before 1.30 p.m. CET, and he is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. CET.\n\nHowever, there will likely be further added time due to security and other preparations.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd. It seems highly likely, however, that his desire to make Greenland part of the USA, the diplomatic furore it has ignited, and new tariffs on Western allies, will be front and center.\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know.\n\nNo clear indication has been given of what the president plans to discuss in his special address to the Davos crowd.

As Business Insider's Jennifer Sor noted yesterday, stocks tumbled in one of the worst days for the US market since April 2025. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq dropped more than 2%, while the Dow wasn't far behind, losing 1.8%.\n\nThings are looking much calmer so far on Wednesday, with investors seemingly in a classic holding pattern ahead of the president's speech later.

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

    "fullText": "Gold prices extended recent gains on Wednesday morning, surging on concerns about escalating tensions over US president Donald Trump's push to take over Greenland.\n\nGold futures (GC=F) jumped 2% to $4,863.50 per ounce at the time of writing, while spot gold was up 2.1% at $4,862.20.\n\nTrump has doubled down on his goal of acquiring the semi-autonomous Danish territory and has threatened to impose new tariffs on eight European countries over opposition to his plans.\n\nThe president is arriving at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday for discussions about Greenland and is due to deliver a speech at the forum later in the day.\n\nEscalating tensions over Trump's pursuit of Greenland has fuelled demand for so-called safe haven investments, seeing investors flock to gold (GC=F), driving prices higher.\n\nWealth Club chief investment strategist Susannah Streeter said: \"It’s not surprising that investors are unnerved and are increasingly seeking out safer havens for their money, less reliant on the trajectory of the US economy.\"\n\n\"For now, it seems the only way is up for the precious metal, as unease continues spread about the potential for fresh geopolitical turmoil and a wider trade war,\" she said.\n\nConcerns about the potential economic fallout of renewed geopolitical tensions also continued to weigh on oil prices on Wednesday morning.\n\nBrent crude (BZ=F) futures declined nearly 0.9% to $64.35 per barrel at the time of writing, while West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) fell 0.8% to $59.86 a barrel.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Geopolitical noise is back in focus, from renewed tariff threats against Europe to tougher enforcement of Venezuelan sanctions, while expectations of rising US crude and gasoline inventories added further pressure.\"\n\n\"Temporary supply outages in Kazakhstan offered some offset, but with those disruptions likely short‑lived, the balance of risks for oil remains tilted to the downside for now.\"\n\nThe pound dipped 0.3% against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) on Wednesday morning, as the latest UK inflation reading came in higher than expected.\n\nData from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released on Wednesday showed that the UK consumer prices index increased to 3.4% in December, up from 3.2% in November. This marked the first rise in inflation for five months and was slightly ahead of forecasts for a 3.3% increase.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico's security minister said Tuesday that it had sent another 37 members of Mexican drug cartels to the United States, as the Trump administration ratchets up pressure on governments to crack down on criminal networks it says are smuggling drugs across the border.\n\nMexican Security Minister Omar García Harfuch wrote in a social media post on X that the people transferred were “high impact criminals” that “represented a real threat to the country’s security.”\n\nIt is the third time in less than one year that Mexico has sent detained cartel members to the U.S. as the country attempts to offset mounting threats by U.S. President Donald Trump. García Harfuch said the government has sent 92 people in total.\n\nVideo shared by Mexican authorities shows a line of handcuffed prisoners surrounded by heavily armed and masked officers being loaded onto a military jet at an airport on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\n“As the pressure increases, as demands from the White House dial up, (Mexico’s government) needs to resort to extraordinary measures, such as these transfers,” said David Mora, a Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s transfer included a handful of important figures from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltrán-Leyva cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, a remnant of the infamous Zetas based in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, across from Texas. Mexican authorities said that all had pending U.S. cases.\n\nAmong those transferred was María Del Rosario Navarro Sánchez, the first Mexican citizen to face charges in the U.S. for providing support to a terrorist organization, after being accused of conspiring with a cartel.\n\nTrump has publicly entertained the idea of military action on Mexican cartels, language that has only gotten more combative since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela deposed former President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.\n\nTurning his attention to Mexico shortly after the Venezuela attack, Trump said in an interview with Fox News: “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.”\n\nLast week, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Trump, telling him that U.S. intervention in Mexico was “not necessary,” but emphasizing that the two governments would continue to collaborate.\n\nLast February, Mexico sent 29 cartel figures to the U.S., including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985. In August, a second round saw 26 Mexican cartel figures sent to the U.S. None had the profile of Caro Quintero, but spanning multiple cartels, the figures could help U.S. prosecutors build cases.\n\nAfter the August transfer, García Harfuch said it was a public safety decision, because Mexico did not want them to continue operating their illicit businesses from inside Mexican prisons.\n\nAnother transfer of prisoners to the U.S. had been rumored for weeks. Mexico has sought to assure the Trump administration that it continues to be a willing partner in combating drug traffickers.\n\n\"For the Trump administration and the Trump base, what is going to matter in the end is some wins that Trump can actually bring back and say ‘Look this is what I’m getting out of Mexico,’” said Mora.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump threatened to blow the nation of Iran up if the country’s government did not stop taunting and threatening him amid growing unrest.\n\nIn a clip of his Tuesday evening interview on NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich Tonight released ahead of time, Trump was asked what his response was to what Pavlich described as taunts and threats issued by Iranian leadership aimed at the president.\n\n“Well, they shouldn’t be doing it, but I’ve left notification that if anything ever happens, the whole country’s going to get blown up,” Trump responded.\n\nTaking a moment to criticize his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for not saying anything about the Iranian regime, he then said, “A president has to defend a president. If I were here, and they were making that threat to somebody—not even a president, but somebody, like they did with me—I would absolutely hit them so hard.”\n\n“But I have very firm instructions,“ he continued. “Anything happens, they’re gonna wipe ’em off the face of this Earth.”\n\nTalking about his other geopolitical ambitions, including seizing control of Greenland, Trump argued that controlling the autonomous Danish territory is crucial in order to ensure the effectiveness of his so-called \"Golden Dome\" defense shield, telling Pavlich, “Having Greenland makes it a much more effective golden dome.”\n\n“So you’re saying Greenland is essential for the security of the United States and the free Western world?” Pavlich asked him. “That’s correct,” Trump replied, adding, “And even beyond missile defense, it is so important for the golden dome, it’s so important for just national, and actually international security.”\n\nThe president also made reference to top-secret weapons in his possession, telling Pavlich, “We have weapons that nobody knows about. It’s probably good not to talk about it, but we have some amazing weapons,” in reference to his attack on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump has previously said that if Iran were to follow through on its threats to target U.S. military or commercial bases, “we will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before” with a “very, very powerful force.”\n\nWhen asked by a CNN reporter earlier this month if he thought the country took his threats seriously, Trump dismissed the question as stupid, arguing that Iran has “been through it for years with me” and citing the killings of Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qasem Soleimani and ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as proof.\n\n“I think so. Don’t you think so, CNN? Don’t you think so? Wouldn’t you say that they probably do at this point? After going through it for years with me, being hit—Soleimani, al-Baghdadi—the Iran nuclear threat wiped out. Don’t you think?” he said, referring to the strikes he launched on three nuclear sites in Iran last June.\n\nThe president has expressed support for anti-government protesters in Iran, going so far as to encourage them to take over national institutions and assuring them that help is on the way as concerns mount about crackdowns on protesters, including arrests and unlawful killings.\n\n“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” he wrote in a Jan. 13 Truth Social post.\n\nHe ended the post with “MIGA!!!,” or “Make Iran Great Again.”\n\nOne day later, he told reporters that he had been notified that Iran had stopped killing protestors and that there were no plans for further executions, providing no source for his claims.\n\nThe Iranian government responded to Trump’s threats with threats of their own, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying, “We are not looking for war, but we are prepared for war.” He added, “We are also ready for negotiations, but negotiations that are fair, with equal rights and mutual respect.”\n\nThe country’s Guardian Council also condemned the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” of Trump, and stressed that any transgression against Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences.”",

The plane is set to be replaced in 2028 by two newer, modified 747-8s estimated to cost over $5 billion in total.\n\nAmid frustrations over delays to the new aircraft, Trump has courted the idea of using another 747-8, gifted to him by the Qatari government, as Air Force One instead.\n\nThe president has said that he plans to keep the $400 million luxury aircraft, which the Defense Department accepted as a gift in May 2025.\n\nThe press pool report sent on Tuesday evening said that Leavitt had joked to reporters that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better\" after the recent technical issue. The report added that the lights in the press cabin went out briefly after takeoff, but that the reason was unclear.\n\nTrump's threats to take over Greenland have been a huge talking point at Davos. He has repeatedly said he wants to buy the semi-autonomous territory, which is governed by Denmark, and is not opposed to using military force to take it.\n\nBefore taking off on Tuesday, the president said in a press briefing that he has a \"lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland\" at Davos.\n\n\"I think things are going to work out pretty well,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHe also said on Saturday that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, if the European countries do not strike a deal with the US to hand over Greenland.",

    "description": "The order comes with a carveout: build-to-rent properties that were designed to be rental communities will not be affected.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday seeking to limit large Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, as part of his push to make essentials more affordable for Americans.\n\nThe order details a multi-pronged plan targeting large investors. It includes measures that would restrict institutional investors from buying homes that individuals could purchase, combat speculation in the single-family housing market, and conduct antitrust reviews of acquisitions.\n\nThe order comes with an important exception: build-to-rent properties that were designed and constructed as rental communities. The order also says there may be other \"narrowly tailored exceptions.\"\n\nPer the order, the Treasury Department has a month to develop definitions of \"large institutional investors\" and \"single-family homes.\" Relevant federal agencies have 60 days to look at ways to prohibit the buying of single-family homes by large entities.\n\n\"Neighborhoods and communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now run by faraway corporate interests. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in the order.\n\nTrump first proposed the order in a Truth Social post earlier this month. \"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nA day later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's proposal would not force large entities to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nAfter Trump's Truth Social post earlier this month, shares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6%. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nAmong Trump's efforts to address affordability concerns, the president also called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Banks and business leaders said that the rule would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades. Our list of other politicians who are obsessed with fast food includes Bill Clinton, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Ted Cruz, and others. Most figures on our list are noted to blur the lines between business and pleasure when it comes to their love of fast food, similar to the way Trump does.\n\nFor more food and drink goodness, Get taste tests, food & drink news, deals from your favorite chains, recipes, cooking tips, and more!",

    "title": "It's been 1 year of Trump's second term. More Americans than ever think he's 'changing America for the worse.'",
    "description": "A growing number also say Trump has been a worse president than they expected, according to a new Yahoo/YouGov poll.",
    "fullText": "It has been exactly one year since Donald Trump was re-inaugurated as president, becoming just the second U.S. commander in chief to return to the White House after losing reelection four years earlier.\n\nNow, at the end of Trump’s first year back in office, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll finds that more Americans than ever think he’s been a “worse president than they expected” — and that he’s “changing America for the worse” as well.\n\nThe survey of 1,709 U.S. adults was conducted from Jan. 8 to 12, right after Trump toppled Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, threatened to forcibly take Greenland from Denmark and mused about using the Insurrection Act against anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis — and right before he and his team celebrated “One Year of MAGA” with a series of posts on social media.\n\n“One year ago, everything changed,” the official White House account wrote on X. “The return of strength. The return of America First. The era of winning is here — and it’s just getting started.”\n\nBut a growing number of Americans seem to disagree. For instance, 49% now say Trump is changing America for the worse — compared to just 34% who say he is changing America for the better. (Only 7% say he’s “not really changing anything.”)\n\nLast March, Trump’s “for the worse” number was 6 percentage points lower (43%) and his “for the better” number was 6 points higher (40%). The gap between the two numbers was 3 points; now it’s 15.\n\nWhy? Because among independents, there has been a significant shift away from Trump.\n\nBefore Trump took office, more independents said they expected Trump to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%).\n\nThen in March, two months into Trump’s second term, 46% of independents said the president was changing America for the worse; 36% said he was changing America for the better.\n\nToday, those numbers are 57% (worse) and 22% (better). In other words, Trump’s “changing America for the worse” rating among independents has risen by 23 points over the course of his second term, while his “changing America for the better” rating has fallen by 19.\n\nFor many Americans, Trump’s performance is increasingly falling short of expectations. After his first year back in office, just 28% say he has been a better president than they expected. More than twice as many (49%) say he has been worse. (Another 20% say he has been “about the same” as they expected.)\n\nThat gap between worse and better — now 21 percentage points — has doubled since last March. Back then, 41% of Americans said Trump had performed worse than they expected; 30% said better.\n\nAmong Republicans, Trump’s numbers haven’t changed at all: they were 63% “better than expected” to 9% “worse than expected” in March, and they are exactly the same today. But among Democrats, Trump’s “worse than expected” number has climbed 10 points (to 86%) as his “about the same” number has dropped 8 points (to 10%).\n\nMeanwhile, a clear majority of independents (57%) now say Trump has been worse than they expected; just 16% say he’s been better. Those numbers were much closer — 44% to 26%, respectively — in March.\n\nTrump’s overall job-approval rating (40% approve to 56% disapprove) has not budged over the last few months; his ratings on individual issues have held steady, too. But looking back over a longer time frame — the first year of Trump’s second term — a clear pattern emerges. Simply put, more and more Americans think the president has the wrong priorities.\n\nIn March, Yahoo and YouGov asked respondents whether Trump had spent the last two months focused on “America’s most important issues” or “issues that aren’t very important.” At the time, they were evenly split: 43% said the former and 45% said the latter.\n\nBut that’s no longer the case. Today, a majority of Americans (51%) say Trump has spent his second term focused on relatively unimportant issues; just 38% say he has focused on the most important things.\n\nThe cost of living remains the biggest drag on Trump’s presidency. A full 70% of Americans now say he has “not focused on it enough”; less than a quarter say he’s focused on it “the right amount” (21%) or “too much (2%).\n\nIn contrast, most Americans (52%) say Trump has focused too much on “arresting and deporting immigrants.”\n\nAs Trump’s poll numbers have declined, he has increasingly blamed his predecessor, President Joe Biden. Yet just 22% of Americans agree that Biden is “most responsible” for “the current state of the country.” A majority (53%) say Trump is most responsible. The rest (25%) say “both equally.”\n\nPessimism about the country’s future is becoming more prevalent as well. In the summer of 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, just 25% of U.S. adults said America’s “best days” were “behind us”; nearly twice as many (46%) said they were “still to come.”\n\nTrump was president at the time, yet Democrats (51%) were nearly as likely as Republicans (53%) to say America’s best days were ahead. Less than a quarter of each said the opposite.\n\nNow, however, more Democrats say America’s best days are behind it (42%) than say they’re still to come (29%). Those numbers are nearly identical among independents.\n\nOnly Republicans remain convinced — 63% to 17% — that the country’s future will be brighter than its past.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,709 U.S. adults interviewed online from Jan. 8 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3.1%.",

    "description": "The US reaching a diplomatic agreement with Denmark that could expand the US's presence in Greenland looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said.",
    "fullText": "That is, Trump Always Chickens Out, or the idea that the president's aggressive policy tactics are mostly bluster aimed at getting a party to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's the question investors are mulling this week as the market swoons amid Trump's fiery comments about the future of Greenland, which he has said the US needs to control for national security.\n\nThe White House has told investors not to count on Trump backing down before, but his latest attempt to put pressure on Denmark has Wall Street talking about the president's notorious negotiation style again.\n\nTrump's most recent maneuver has been to threaten eight European nations with 10% tariffs starting in February, ramping up to 25% in June if no deal on Greenland is reached.\n\nTo some forecasters, the Greenland situation is clear: It's another opportunity for investors to position for the TACO trade.\n\n\"I think we need to read this from an 'Art of the Deal' perspective,\" analysts at JPMorgan's international markets intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Trump creates noise and throws in a maximal stance designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage/urgency.\"\n\n\"The market wants to see if today is TACO Tuesday,\" the bank's market intelligence team added.\n\n\"How much uncertainty investors can stomach is a good question, but the resolve in the FOMO and TACO trade (the belief that President Trump is bluffing on Greenland and is only working to secure a 'deal') has proven time and again to be very difficult to break,\" David Rosenberg, a top economist and the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAmid talk of a TACO trade revival, analysts say they see a handful of outcomes from Trump's tough talk on Greenland. Here are three ways forecasters see the situation playing out.\n\nThe US reaching an agreement with Denmark that could expand US presence in Greenland — such as by getting access to the territory's natural resources — looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said, pegging the scenario with a 55% probability.\n\n\"We know Trump opens with a maximal stance, designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage. This is no different,\" the bank said, noting that the timing of the tariff threats looked \"not coincidental,\" given that the World Economic Forum is in full swing this week.\n\nAnalysts added that a sale of Greenland looks \"less likely\" due to the need to get Denmark's approval, and the US using military force to take Greenland looks \"highly unlikely,\" since it would draw pushback from Republican lawmakers and voters. The US attacking another NATO member could also open the door to further aggression from the bloc's rivals, JPMorgan added.\n\nThere's a 40% chance Trump's new tariffs won't be implemented at all, possibly by Trump's \"own retreat,\" according to Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at BCA Research.\n\nGertken added that he believed there was a 70% chance the situation in Greenland would have a \"non-military\" solution, and a 30% chance that solution would involve a short-term trade war with Europe.\n\n\"Global stocks would fall, while US treasuries and the dollar would fall, but the administration would then change course, as it did after Liberation Day,\" he wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nChristopher Granville, a managing director at TS Lombard, added that he believed the most likely outcome was a \"truce\" between the US and Europe, with the US likely suspending tariffs as negotiations over Greenland stretch on.\n\nThat was what happened when Trump first introduced tariffs on Mexico and Canada last year, Granville added, later pointing to political pressures from the coming midterm elections, which could incentivize Trump to lower tariffs.\n\n\"Some commentators may slap the TACO label on any such truce that could be agreed at this week's in-person meetings in Davos between Trump and various European leaders,\" Granville said, though he noted that the situation wouldn't be a \"TACO for real\" scenario, since the US wasn't backing down on Greenland entirely.\n\nThe expected Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs could also come into play.\n\nBCA estimated there was around a 50% chance the Supreme Court could strike down Trump's tariffs, up from a 30% chance the firm had predicted earlier.\n\n\"Normally the court would defer to the president on international issues. But now the president threatens to entangle the court in lawless behavior that threatens the court's credibility and the constitutional balance of powers,\" Gertken said, pointing to Trump's threats against the NATO alliance. \"So we have less confidence that the court will defend the president's stance.\"\n\nJPMorgan's international market intelligence team said the latest tariff threats were \"riddled with challenges.\"\n\n\"First, the proposed tariffs are based on IEEPEA, which the Supreme Court could imminently rule to be illegal in their application. Second, I would think it practically impossible to tariff 6x EU countries at a different rate to other members, given the freedom of movement of goods which structurally exists within the EU,\" the bank's Matthew See wrote.",

    "fullText": "US stocks plunged, and bonds sold off on Tuesday on Donald Trump's feud with Europe over Greenland.\n\nAfter spending much of 2025 doubting the president over everything from tariffs to threats to fire Fed boss Jerome Powell, stocks had their worst day since October amid Donald Trump's fight with European nations about who should control the Danish territory.\n\nThe sell America trade was in the spotlight again on Tuesday amid the latest turmoil.\n\nUS stocks plunged as investors took in the latest tariff threats targeting eight European Union countries if Denmark doesn't put Greenland up for sale by the start of February. EU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\nMajor indexes fell sharply, with losses accelerating in afternoon trading. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, and traders sought shelter in defensive assets like gold and silver. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2%.\n\nLong-dated US Treasury yields spiked, while the US dollar declined against a basket of other currencies. Highlighting tensions in the bond market, a Danish pension said it was exiting the market for US government debt, with plans to dump $100 million in Treasurys due to \"poor\" US government finances.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were other big moves across markets:\n\nUntil now, investors had mostly brushed off Trump's talk of taking over Greenland.\n\nThat seems to have changed now that tariffs are back in the picture.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said eight NATO countries, including Denmark, would face a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US in February, with the rate increasing to 25% in June if Denmark doesn't agree to \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"\n\n\"The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years,\" the president wrote on his social media platform over the weekend, pointing to new defense initiatives that make acquiring Greenland \"especially important\" for the US.\n\n\"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,\" he continued.\n\nThe sell-off has largely been driven by investors trimming their exposure to US equities now that tariffs, a major concern for markets all throughout last year, appear to be on the table, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also seem worried that the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's reciprocal tariffs could add further volatility in markets, he added.\n\n\"The US President upped his aggressive rhetoric overnight,\" Morrison said of the selling pressure. \"While some on Wall Street argue any tariff-driven sell-off could be a buying opportunity as the earnings season picks up steam, the scale and breadth of Trump's rhetoric have unsettled risk appetite.\"\n\nThe latest tariff threats are also driving a flight to safe-haven or defensive assets, like metals. Gold rose another 3% while silver jumped 8%.\n\n\"Global investors are clearly adding to the risk premium embedded in US assets, and diversification flows are picking up,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nA major move in Japan's bond market also contributed to some of the volatility in the US. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond hit a record 4.21% on Tuesday as investors weighed a new tax cut proposal that has raised concerns about the nation's growing deficit.\n\nThe nation's 10-year government bond yield also increased by more than 10 basis points to trade around 2.38%, a level that hasn't been seen in 27 years.\n\nRising yields in Japan have sparked fresh concern about the amount of foreign capital flowing into US markets. Specifically, investors are worried about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy in which traders borrow money at low rates in Japan to deploy in markets that offer higher returns, such as the US.\n\n\"As a sliding yen triggers intervention chatter, the fate of the massive 'yen-carry trade' hangs in the balance,\" Ed Yardeni, the President of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",

As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner has called on Congress to launch an investigation into Donald Trump‘s “fitness” to serve as President, following his ongoing attempts to own Greenland.\n\nReiner, who previously served as cardiologist to the late Vice President Dick Cheney, took to X on Monday (January 19) to share his thoughts on Trump’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. In the letter, the president appears to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his not having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the letter, which he also asked to be distributed to other European countries.\n\nIn his post, Reiner wrote, “This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness.”\n\nThis letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness. https://t.co/HkHzsiTau4\n\n— Jonathan Reiner (@JReinerMD) January 19, 2026\n\nReiner’s comments come just days after he said Trump needed to be evaluated, following a recent Oval Office meeting that appeared to show the President falling asleep while surrounded by officials and guests.\n\n“The president seems to be struggling with excessive daytime somnolence,” Reiner wrote, referring to the condition Hypersomnia, which makes a person feel extremely sleepy during the day. “Repeatedly falling asleep with a dozen people surrounding your desk is not normal. It needs to be evaluated.”\n\nReiner has spoken frequently about his concerns for Trump’s health in recent months. Last month, the medical expert talked to CNN’s Jake Tapper about Trump’s December 17 White House address, which he said “was delivered with a manic cadence, almost a frantic cadence… And that kind of manic delivery was very, very disturbing.”\n\nHe also touched on Trump’s apparent sleepiness, adding, “It’s jarring to see the president go from basically asleep in the Oval Office to, you know, really this rapid-fire pace during basically a 30 minute speech that he gave in 18 minutes.”\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner responded to Trump’s comments about his high-dose aspirin regimen, calling it “nonsense” and medically unnecessary.\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time.\n\nWhatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.\n\nI heard the word \"trust\" used a lot yesterday in the context of the rising geopolitical tension and fears that we've reached a breaking point.\n\nFor the business world, that means a global economy that's a lot less … global. We've been headed in that direction for a while, but this week feels like an inflection point. Talk of the year ahead includes discussions about businesses needing to silo their global operations, even for digitally focused strategies.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom. The conversations around AI have been fascinating, from the evolution of AI agents to concerns over cyber risks in the space to the potential that physical AI (think robots and autonomous systems) could be much larger than generative AI.\n\nFor more of our Davos coverage, please follow along on our live blog and",

    "fullText": "New trade tensions as the US and Europe spar over Greenland are the latest catalyst that's sending investors flocking to gold and silver on Tuesday.\n\nGold jumped more than 3% to around $4,740 per ounce, and silver spiked 8% to top $95.20 an ounce. Investors have been rattled by President Donald Trump's latest fight with the European Union over Greenland. Trump has doubled down on his calls for the US to take control of the Danish territory. He said that the US would hit EU countries opposed to his takeover with a 10% tariffs starting on February 1, increasing the import duty to 25% in June if no agreement is hammered out.\n\nEU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\n\"Geopolitical uncertainty has boosted demand for both silver and gold just as they were taking off in near-parabolic fashion,\" David Morrison, senior market analyst at TradeNation, said. \"They have become the havens of choice for investors, and this has been bolstered by recent US dollar weakness. Silver also has a strong back story.\"\n\nMorrison said that the higher their prices rise, the greater the chance the market will see a correction, but with geopolitical uncertainty high and Trump showing no signs of taking steps to ease trade tensions, the rally in metals could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs Trump heads to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, investors are watching closely for updates on his trade plans and the fight over Greenland.\n\nWhile gold has surged as a general hedge against macro volatility and geopolitical tensions, silver is up amid a handful of other factors, including a supply squeeze and applications in the AI buildout.\n\nMorrison said previously that the reason silver is outpacing gold is likely due to short supply and the fact that it is a substantially smaller market. Demand for both metals is high, but silver may be the more tempting play for investors as it trades at a lower price per ounce.\n\n\"The prevailing view amongst the bulls is that silver is in short supply, while demand from both investors and industry remains strong,\" Morrison noted. \"And, as with gold, this morning's drop in the US dollar has also added to the general bullishness.\"",

    "description": "A sell-off in Japanese government bonds was part of a one-two punch hitting markets on Tuesday, alongside Trump's latest Greenland threats.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nJapanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall.\n\nWhat's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament.\n\nThe news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation.\n\nAs of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland.\n\n\"These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse,\" David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. \"Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe.\"\n\nRising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nWith yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the \"carry trade.\" Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields.\n\nYields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets.\n\nHow things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields,\" Boivin and his team wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too.\n\nFor one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made a stunning denial when he was confronted about the unhinged letter blaming his failure to win the Nobel Prize for his threats to seize Greenland.\n\nMonday saw yet another surreal escalation in the Trump Nobel Peace Prize story. Just days after he yoinked the award from 2025 recipient María Corina Machado, Trump sent a letter to Norway bitterly complaining that he no longer feels “an obligation to think purely of Peace.”\n\nWhy? Because “your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS.”\n\n(The prize is not awarded by the Kingdom of Norway, and Trump has not “stopped 8 wars PLUS.)\n\nThe president held a brief gaggle with reporters just before midnight on Monday after he attended the college football championship game in Miami, during which he was confronted about the letter.\n\nDespite having lobbied relentlessly for the award and accepting an invented FIFA prize in its stead and yoinking Machado’s award and centering a threatening international letter around it, Trump denied caring about the prize:\n\nREPORTER: Can you speak to your letter that you wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that the Nobel Prize influenced your thinking on Greenland?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don’t care about the Nobel prize.\n\nFirst of all, a very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize. And I appreciate that.\n\nIf anybody thinks that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize! They’re just kidding. They have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway. And I don’t care what Norway says.\n\nBut I really don’t care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I’ve saved tens of millions of lives.\n\nIf you look at India, Pakistan, just as one, two nuclear powers. You look at so many of the countries that were in a 30, In some cases, a 35-year war, and I got it done.\n\nWe stopped eight wars, and maybe we’ll be stopping a ninth very soon.

    "fullText": "The neofascist tech oligarch was cast out of Trump’s inner circle, but his money and influence are still omnipresent.\n\nLast June, the relationship between President Donald Trump and his top political benefactor, Elon Musk, seemed to be in shambles. Wrapping up his 180-day tenure as a “special government employee,” Musk had stepped down from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had secured for the world’s richest mogul even greater power (and some very valuable government data). Musk’s close involvement with the agenda of the second Trump administration had prompted critics to call it the “Trump-Musk White House”—but the now-sidelined tech oligarch seemed to have become the same sort of obsolete Trump crony that Rex Tillerson or Mike Pence had been in the wake of Trump’s first term.\n\nDespite all the chaos Musk fomented at DOGE by unleashing a corps of twentysomething engineers to wipe out payrolls and agencies under dodgy AI-driven data raids, he failed to sufficiently handicap the administrative state or nuke government spending as he had pledged to. Trump had also decided not to pick Musk’s close ally Jared Isaacman to be NASA administrator—a key post for a tech oligarch with a bevy of government rocket-launch contracts and aspirations to go to Mars—because of Isaacman’s history as a donor to Democratic political campaigns. Things were getting frosty.\n\nMusk, as is his wont, was posting hysterically late into the night on X. Rather than attacking destitute migrants or trans Democrats, Musk was now targeting Trump, whom he accused of various betrayals. The tech mogul claimed to be especially outraged over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that vastly expanded government spending while slashing taxes—a measure that Musk saw as a “disgusting abomination” certain to balloon the national debt. Finally, Musk wrote on X, it was “time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nAs the Department of Justice’s dissembling in the ongoing Epstein files farrago has demonstrated, Musk was in some sense correct. But his supposed “really big bomb” had a surprisingly small blast radius. It also seemed to lack the conviction of its poster: Musk eventually deleted the message.\n\nMusk made noise about starting an America Party to challenge Trumpian spending, but it never went beyond a super PAC that seems destined to become another MAGA totem, on course to be folded into the mainstream GOP apparatus. While touting the work of Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian Trump gadfly, Musk has otherwise continued to put his money into top Republican organizations. He gave $15 million to three Republican super PACs just before he threatened to start his America Party.\n\nDespite being a vindictive president with vast powers at his disposal, Trump did nothing to retaliate against Musk after he began speaking out. There was some public bickering, including Trump threatening to “terminate” Musk’s government contracts. The president and some of his allies described Musk as an erratic drug addict. But the Musk-Trump relationship was easily mended, at least as a combined political project. Their handshake reunion at the Charlie Kirk memorial was a reminder of how quickly transactional political relationships can be repaired—and that Trump and Musk, who traded barbs well before the 2024 election, have done this before.\n\nWith an eye toward stopping any blue wave in the 2026 midterms, Musk is continuing to shovel money behind the MAGA electoral juggernaut and other administration priorities. Axios recently reported that Musk attended a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and various Trump advisers to discuss midterm donations and political strategy. Susie Wiles, the influential Trump chief of staff who had recently described Musk as a ketamine addict in an interview with Vanity Fair, was also there.\n\nSo in spite of the public furors that have hounded the Trump-Musk alliance, the deeper alignment of interests is clear. Musk needs government contracts and subsidies—which have amounted to $38 billion to date, according to an exhaustive Washington Post investigation. The Department of Defense and the Space Force need SpaceX’s rocket launch capabilities. Trump and the Republican Party need Musk’s money—after raking in some $290 million of it in the 2024 cycle—and the propagandistic power of X, which shouldn’t be underrated. And no one really needs an overblown public media war (that, given past results, would probably be poorly leveraged by Democrats but might fracture an increasingly fragile MAGA base).\n\nSince Musk left DOGE and implied that the president was a pedophile, his companies have continued to accrue valuable contracts, while SpaceX has cemented itself as the premier space-launch vehicle for an administration that would like to colonize everything from Greenland to outer space. In 2025, SpaceX received contracts from the US Space Force worth more than $6 billion. The Department of Defense continues to use Starlink, SpaceX’s Internet service built on thousands of small satellites crowding low-earth orbit, and handed out at least $200 million in contracts for xAI’s Grok, Musk’s Hitlerian, deepfake-crafting chatbot. That software will soon be integrated into military networks, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth bragged. Other government departments that made deals to use Grok have been slower to roll out the software, citing a need for more testing.\n\nCompared to his colleagues Peter Thiel and David Sacks—both pivotal players in the rise of the tech right and the funneling of massive amounts of cash from Silicon Valley to Republican interests—Musk was late in coming to reactionary techno-fascism. A centi-billionaire who ruled over a large business empire, he was not deeply involved in electoral politics before 2020. That changed thanks to the social, economic, and political upheavals surrounding Covid—as well as the personal ordeal of his daughter Vivian Wilson coming out as trans and publicly disowning him. In response, Musk promptly disowned both social liberalism and democracy itself. He theorized a new public menace that he dubbed the woke mind virus and began setting his sights on controlling public discourse and the highest levels of government. And in his shambolic way, he’s been quite successful at it.\n\nMusk’s behavior may be terribly chaotic and inconsistent, full of impossible promises about technological glories to come and threats to create political organizations that never graduate beyond X posts. But he still has the zeal of the convert and unlimited resources. In his grievances—and in his social and business networks—Musk is firmly enmeshed in the far-right MAGA project underwritten by a new tech aristocracy that has little regard for the basic tenets of electoral democracy. For now, as 2026 approaches, Musk’s pro-Republican donations and rhetoric are already flowing firmly behind the president and his party’s prerogatives. The only question is how far the world’s richest man will go.",

    "fullText": "Inside the big rewards tech titans have reaped from caving to Trump. Plus, a look at the US datacenter boom and the effects of Australia’s social media ban\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, the Guardian’s US tech editor.\n\nOne year ago today, Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States. Standing alongside him that day were the leaders of the tech industry’s most powerful companies, who had donated to him in an unprecedented bending of the knee. In the ensuing year, the companies have reaped enormous rewards from their alliance with Trump, which my colleague Nick Robins-Early and I wrote about last month after Trump signed an executive order prohibiting states from passing laws regulating AI. Trump has sponsored the tech industry with billions in government funding and with diplomatic visits that featured CEOs as his fellow negotiators in massive, lucrative deals.\n\nAs year two of Trump’s second term begins, Silicon Valley’s titans appear poised to enrich themselves even more with the president’s enthusiastic aid.\n\nToday in tech, we’re exploring the political consequences of the expansion of datacenters in the US and Europe as well as taking stock of Australia’s under-16 social media ban.\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his goal of total deregulation of AI and his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nTrump’s anxiety is evident in two actions last week. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n““We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nAnd then on Friday, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as my colleagues Oliver Milman and Dharna Noor reported over the weekend, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue which has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like the rest of us (Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon). Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters, but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those of the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost of living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stop in the datacenter boom: the Middle East, where energy is cheap but water is not abundant, and India, where the power grid is not as reliable …\n\nLawmakers in the UK and around the world are calling for bans on social media accounts for teenagers and children in the wake of Australia’s successful social media ban for under-16s. My colleague Josh Taylor offers a look at how the ban is playing out in its native country. Despite social media companies reporting millions of accounts deleted in compliance with the ban, the opposition party is questioning its effectiveness:\n\nMore than 4.7m social media accounts held by Australians who platforms have judged to be under 16 years of age were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first days after the ban came into effect on 10 December, the prime minister has said.\n\nDespite the high numbers, the federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting,” said the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh.\n\nHe called himself an ‘untouchable hacker god’. But who was behind the biggest crime Finland has ever known?\n\nChatGPT to start showing ads in the US\n\nMy picture was used in child abuse images.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's push to acquire Greenland is spilling into markets, drawing attention to Europe's leverage in US capital markets.\n\nOn Tuesday, Treasurys sold off. Yields climbed to their highest level in more than four months as \"Sell America\" fears gripped markets amid the latest geopolitical tensions. The US Dollar Index also moved lower.\n\n\"Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries,\" wrote George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank's global head of currency research, in a note on Sunday.\n\nThat exposure highlights a key vulnerability for the US, which depends heavily on foreign investors to finance its debt.\n\nEuropean countries own around $8 trillion of US bonds and equities — almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Deutsche.\n\n\"For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits,\" Saravelos added.\n\nHe pointed out that Danish pension funds were among the first to repatriate capital and cut dollar exposure last year in response to uncertainty over Trump's policies. Saravelos also warned that dollar exposure across Europe remains elevated.\n\n\"In an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially, it is not clear why Europeans would be as willing to play this part,\" Saravelos said.\n\nBeyond currencies, Saravelos said the real risk lies in capital markets as the US is more vulnerable to foreign investors than ever before.\n\n\"It is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,\" he wrote.\n\nThat risk is already starting to be priced in, according to Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The market dynamic we are seeing increasing evidence of is that US assets (including the USD) are now carrying a much higher political risk premium,\" Weston wrote on Monday.\n\nThat shift could push foreign investors to reduce their US exposure and adjust how much dollar risk they hold, weighing on the currency and boosting haven assets like gold, he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed market speculation that Europe could dump its US assets in retaliation for Trump's tariff threat over Greenland.\n\n\"There is no talk in European governments,\" Bessent told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling it a \"completely false narrative.\"\n\n\"It defies any logic, and I could not disagree more strongly on that.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump wrapped up his first year in his second term. Here's how inflation, the job market, tariffs, and spending have evolved.",
    "fullText": "The US experienced the smallest job growth outside a recession since 2003 last year, adding just 584,000 jobs.\n\nDraho said overall policy uncertainty, tariffs, immigration, and fears of a recession from months ago have been factors.\n\n\"It's made companies a little more reluctant to invest, to hire, if you're not sure how much of an overall economic drag that tariffs would have,\" Draho said about overall uncertainty. \"So even if your company may not be directly affected by tariffs, just the uncertainty of how this could play out would be a bit of a negative.\"\n\nEconomists and job-market experts have said that the slower job market is unsustainable. Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "description": "Scott Bessent argued Trump is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic.”",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that President Donald Trump wants to annex Greenland in order to keep the U.S. from getting “dragged” into an “attack” on the territory from Russia.\n\nDuring an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker questioned Bessent over why Trump is still seeking to seize Greenland despite the fact that the “leaders of Denmark and Greenland [have said] bluntly, ‘Greenland is not for sale.’”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nWelker asked the question after noting that Trump alluded on Friday he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back his actions regarding Greenland.\n\n“Kristen, if we look for years, for over a century, American presidents have wanted to acquire Greenland,” he responded. “And what we can see is that Greenland is essential to the U.S. national security. We’re building the golden dome, the missile system.”\n\nClaiming that Trump is “being strategic” and is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic,” Bessent said: “We are not going to outsource our national security. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to other countries.”\n\nHe added, “In Trump 1.0, President Trump told the Europeans, ‘Do not build Nord Stream 2. Do not rely on Russian oil.’ And guess what, Kristen? Guess what is funding Russia’s efforts against Ukraine? European purchases of Russian oil. So America has to be in control there.”\n\nPolitics: CNN Panelist Goes Nuclear On Scott Jennings In Viral Post: ‘I’m Probably About To Be Banned’\n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Greenland and hasnot ruled out using military force to obtain it despite pushback from European leaders.\n\nWelker pressed Bessent over how serious Trump is about Greenland and whether his actions have been a part of a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security,” he replied, before adding that “down the road, this fight for the Arctic is real.”\n\n“We would keep our NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack on Greenland from Russia, from some other area, we would get dragged in,” he said. “So better now, peace through strength, make it part of the United States, and there will not be a conflict because the United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world.”\n\n“We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength.”\n\nWelker didn’t let up, urging Bessent to confirm whether Trump has been using a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“Is the goal to get a deal to have enhanced security in Greenland, for example?” she asked.\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Tries To Sweet-Talk Territory Takeover Bid\n\n“The president believes that enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the U.S.,” he replied.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker questioned the White House official over why it’s “necessary [for the U.S.] to take over and annex all of Greenland” despite the fact that “85% of people living in Greenland oppose” the potential move.\n\n“The United States has a base in Greenland. I’ve been talking to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Denmark has given the United States a green light to beef up its security as much as is needed in Greenland. Why not take that route?” she asked Bessent.\n\n“Well, again let’s look back. Denmark has a terrible history with Greenlanders,” he responded. “There were forced sterilizations up until the ’80s or the ’90s. So all of a sudden, now that the U.S. has expressed an interest, there is, you know, this new interest.”\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem: Don't Say ICE Agent Jonathan Ross' Name\n\nClaiming that the “United States needs to be in control to prevent a war,” Bessent added, “And we do not want to get dragged into someone else’s war.”\n\nWelker later brought up that “senior Democrats say there are no pressing threats on Greenland’s security from Russia or China,” before asking Bessent what “evidence” the Trump administration has that there is a “pressing threat.”\n\nShe also noted “the Danish foreign minister says there hasn’t been a Chinese warship in Greenland for a decade.”\n\n“Well, first of all, Kristen, we have asymmetric information. And again, President Trump is being strategic here. What evidence was there that the Russians were going into Crimea? Well, actually there was a lot of evidence that the Russians were going to go into Ukraine,” he responded.\n\nPolitics: Wall Street Journal Flags A Dark Downside To Donald Trump’s Greenland Push\n\nBessent pivoted to placing the blame on the Biden administration. “And Joe Biden said, ‘Well, just take a little bit of it.’ But what we know is that Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the U.S.”\n\n“And it will not need to be defended if it is part of the U.S. The president is trying to avoid a conflict,” he added.\n\nWrapping up their discussion on Greenland, Welker asked: “If the United States were to take Greenland by force, how would that be different than Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”\n\n“Look, I believe that Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States,” he responded.\n\nWatch Bessent’s “Meet the Press” interview below.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Called Out For Falsifying Michael Jackson, Diana Ross Photos In Epstein Files\n\nAnother High-Ranking Republican Can't Help But Praise Mamdani\n\nBessent Says U.S. Food Aid Benefits 'Could' Flow By Wednesday",

The shooting spawned waves of protests.\n\nThe Trump administration has sent thousands of immigration agents ​to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks as part ‌of a campaign to ramp up deportations of people in the country without authorization.\n\nTensions over the deployment have mounted considerably since an ICE agent fatally shot Good.\n\nThe court case was brought on behalf of six protesters and observers who claimed their constitutional rights ⁠had been infringed by the actions ​of ICE agents.\n\nThe order explicitly prohibits ​federal officers from detaining people who are peacefully protesting or merely observing the officers, unless there is reasonable ‍suspicion that they ⁠are interfering with law enforcement or have committed a crime.\n\nFederal agents also are banned from using pepper spray, tear ⁠gas or other crowd-control munitions against peaceful demonstrators or bystanders observing and recording ‌the immigration enforcement operations.",

    "fullText": "(KRON) — A Bay Area Democratic congressman has added their voice to a growing chorus of people calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked over a letter President Donald Trump sent Norway’s Prime Minister. In the letter, Trump appears to connect his interest in the United States taking over Greenland to being bypassed for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump falsely claims in the letter to Norway’s PM Jonas Gahr Støre, adding, “although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nCHP begins enforcing English language rule for truckers\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government but rather by a five-person committee chosen by the Norwegian parliament.\n\n“Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Støre said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump’s letter continued, “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”\n\n“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” Trump continued.\n\nThe letter revived calls similar to those heard during the first Trump administration for using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. The 25th Amendment pertains to what happens if the president or vice president becomes incapacitated — either mentally or physically — and is unable to fulfill their duties.\n\nUnder the amendment, members of the president’s cabinet could legally remove him from office if they do not believe he is fit to lead.\n\n“Trump’s new gigantic temper tantrum over Norway is deep into 25th Amendment territory,” wrote Rick Wilson of the Lincoln Project on X.\n\n“25th Amendment. Now,” tweeted former Republican congressman Joe Walsh.\n\n“Invoke the 25th Amendment,” tweeted U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).\n\nEast Bay Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore) simply tweeted “25,” along with a copy of the letter.\n\nNo member of Trump’s cabinet has signaled any intention of removing President Trump from office.",

    "description": "Mr. Tariff’s eponymous policy is causing Americans more harm than good. Contrary to President Donald Trump’s favorite economic claim, U.S. import tariffs are almost exclusively paid for by Americans, new research has found.",
    "fullText": "Mr. Tariff’s eponymous policy is causing Americans more harm than good.\n\nContrary to President Donald Trump’s favorite economic claim, U.S. import tariffs are almost exclusively paid for by Americans, new research has found.\n\nThe study, published on Monday by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, reports that American consumers and importers bear 96 percent of the burden from Trump’s aggressive tariff policy.\n\nTrump, 79, has spent the majority of his second term boasting that his tariffs are bringing in billions in revenue from other nations.\n\n“The tariffs are an own goal,” Kiel Institute Research Director and a co-author of the study, Julian Hinz, said. “The claim that foreign countries pay these tariffs is a myth. The data show the opposite: Americans are footing the bill.”\n\nThe research examined over 25 million shipment records for U.S. imports between January 2024 and November 2025, totaling nearly $4 trillion in value, and found that foreign exporters paid only about four percent of the tariff burden, while U.S. buyers absorbed the rest.\n\nInstead of taxing foreign producers, the tariffs serve more as a domestic consumption tax, the report says, predicting that American consumers will face higher prices going forward.\n\nThe data showed that rather than countries reducing their prices to offset the tariffs, they reduced their shipping to the U.S.\n\n“We compared Indian exports to the US with shipments to Europe and Canada and identified a clear pattern,” Hinz said. “Both export value and volume to the US dropped sharply, by up to 24 percent. But unit prices—the prices Indian exporters charged—remained unchanged. They shipped less, not cheaper.”\n\n“Tariffs ultimately disadvantage everyone,” he added.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told the Daily Beast: “The average tariff imposed by America has increased by almost tenfold under President Trump, and inflation has continued to cool from Biden-era highs.”\n\n“The Administration has consistently maintained that foreign exporters who depend on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market, will ultimately pay the cost of tariffs, and that’s exactly what’s playing out,” Desai said.\n\nTrump’s obsession with tariffs has heightened global tensions throughout his second term, as his unpredictable threats and follow-through have led to volatile market conditions.\n\nIn a lengthy post to Truth Social on Saturday, the president threatened a 10 percent import tax against eight European nations that have opposed his takeover of Greenland, which would take effect on February 1.\n\n“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to rule on the legality of Trump’s global tariffs, to which Trump said the U.S. would be “SCREWED” if the court did not rule in his favor.",

Both designs were reportedly seen Saturday on the heads of protesters in Nuuk and Copenhagen.\n\nAll profits go to support a Greenlandic children's charity, Schøtt said.\n\nOther riffs on the original MAGA phrasing have also cropped up in the first year of Trump's second term, with hats saying \"Make America Gay Again,\" \"Make NATO Great Again,\" and \"Make America Normal Again\" available from various shops online.",

    "description": "US tariffs under Donald Trump have been paid almost entirely by Americans, with foreign exporters paying for only 4%, a German study found.",
    "fullText": "A favorite tool of President Donald Trump has been costing Americans, according to new study.\n\nThe brunt of US tariffs — 96% — have been paid by US buyers, research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, found, while about 4% of the tariff burden was paid by foreign exporters.\n\n\"American importers and consumers bear nearly all the cost,\" the researchers said of the tariffs.\n\nThe study, published Monday, said that the $200 billion increase in customs revenue that the US government raised in 2025 was a \"tax paid almost entirely by Americans.\"\n\nThe research contradicts Trump's messaging that tariff costs would not be paid by Americans, but by other countries and overseas exporters. The president's aggressive tariff policy launched last year placed additional duties on dozens of trade partners, including China, India, and the European Union.\n\nThe Kiel Institute study examined more than 25 million shipment records, worth nearly $4 trillion, between January 2024 and November 2025. The researchers found that there was a \"near-complete pass-through\" of the tariffs.\n\n\"US import prices rise nearly one-for-one with tariffs, while trade volumes contract,\" the study said.\n\nThe findings echo other research that has found Americans are paying for tariffs, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America also said last year that Americans were the ones paying for the tariffs.\n\nThe Kiel study said American importers and wholesalers are first hit by the tariff cost, followed by manufacturers and retailers, all of which must choose whether to absorb the tariff or pass it on to their customers. American consumers are then hit by increased prices, both on imported goods or American-made products that use foreign inputs. There's been more limited availability of goods in the US, the researchers found.\n\nTrump has continued to use tariffs, saying on Saturday that he would impose additional tariffs on Denmark and other European countries unless they agree to a deal that would transfer Greenland to the US.\n\nMany of Trump's tariff policies could also be undone. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of a host of Trump's tariffs that were instituted under an emergency national security law. Trump has said the US would be \"screwed\" if the tariffs are overturned.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has vowed to \"100%\" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland.\n\nEuropean allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide.\n\nOn Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.\n\nAsked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\".\n\nThe US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.\n\nTrump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949.\n\nAsked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\"\n\nTrump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\"\n\nDenmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.\n\nHowever, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.\n\nDanish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\".\n\n\"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\"\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic.\n\nThe European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".\n\n\"But trades threats are not the way to go about this,\" Kallas added. \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"\n\n'Europe is at a total loss': Russia gloats over Greenland tensions\n\n'Europe won't be blackmailed,' Danish PM says in wake of Trump Greenland threats\n\nFaisal Islam: Trump's Greenland threats to allies are without parallel\n\nIt comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.\n\n\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" Støre added.\n\nTrump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say.\n\n\"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nThe joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation \"to support various long-planned Norad activities\", and said they had been coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed.\n\nSimilar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year.",

The program allowed citizens of 125 countries to apply for permission to enter easily online.\n\nFrom August 2024, citizens of countries like the United States, Canada and most European and Asian nations could apply for a 90-day tourist or business visa for free by submitting their passport information and trip details through a government portal.\n\nTravelers looking to come to the country were the first to notice that the \"Pak ID\" mobile application now directs applicants to select a traditional visa category for which they have to pay $35 USD for a single entry of up to three months (the prior visa allowed for multiple entries) and will take up to seven business days to be processed.\n\nCitizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have to pay a higher $60 fee for reasons not expanded upon. The Pakistani government has not released an official statement on the change or provided any information on whether the simplified application will ever be brought back.\n\nIn August 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif classified \"this easing of the visa regime [as a way to] help make Pakistan an attractive destination for investments and tourism.\"\n\nThe country sees significantly less tourism interest than neighboring India and has over the last half-decade made several efforts to draw in international visitors.",

Keep reading \n\nIn the video, Donald and Melania were walking hand and hand when Donald noticed the reporters and dropped his wife's hand to approach the group. \"She did a great job on television the other night,\" he told the reporters, gesturing at Melania. \"And I didn't do so bad either,\" he added, \"but she did a great job on television.\" He then retreated back to his waiting wife, who was brushing rain off of her face, and took her hand again as they started back toward their destination. The cameras followed them, however, and captured Donald only holding his umbrella above his own head, leaving Melania to continue to get soaked by the rain.\n\nIn the comment section of the video, social media users were ruthless in calling out Trump for his lack of manners. \"He was probably scared his tan would wash off,\" one person suggested, and another asked, \"Is this a surprise?\"\n\n\"What a gentleman...NOT!!\" another comment reads.\n\n\"Afraid of his hair going flat and his makeup running,\" another person agreed.\n\n\"It's honestly just a lack of respect,\" pointed out another.\n\n\"As always, he thinks and cares about no one except himself!\" added the next person.\n\n\"What man lets his woman get wet in the rain?\" asked another.\n\n\"This man is no gentleman at all he hogging up the whole umbrella for himself and didn't even cover his wife!\" a final user posted.",

But when Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News Sunday that the Department of Justice will not investigate the actions of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed Renee Good on January 7, I’ll admit to a moment of shock.\n\n“What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans, because it was recorded when it happened,” Blanche told anchor Shannon Bream. “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody or putting his life in danger, we never do…\n\n“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here…. We are not going to bow to pressure from the media, from politicians. So no, we are not investigating.”\n\nBREAM: Is the FBI conducting an investigation into the ICE agent who shot Renee Good?\n\nBLANCHE: What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans because it was recorded. We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here. We are not… pic.twitter.com/FIQVVavJhq\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, however, was not surprised. “No, I wasn’t shocked, because this is what we’ve been hearing on the ground for days,” he told me Monday morning. “I was glad to hear him say it, because we can bring it to a court.”\n\nEllison and Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty have promised to investigate Good’s killing, but the Justice Department has refused to share the evidence it has collected. “But if they’re not investigating? How do they justify not giving us shell casings, the cars [Good’s and Ross’s], the photos?”\n\nBlanche did get one fact right on Sunday: “Millions of Americans” have indeed seen the footage of Ross shooting Good at close range—and most of them think the ICE agent was in the wrong. An astonishing 82 percent of people polled by Quinnipiac said they’d seen video of the incident, and a majority said Ross was at fault; his life was never “in danger.” Several painstaking New York Times analyses examined the many cell-phone videos of the incident—including Ross’s own—and concluded there is no evidence Good’s vehicle ever struck the agent. He shot her at least twice—one shot directly into her left ear—after she had clearly turned the SUV away from him. There’s at least a foot of daylight between the vehicle and the ICE agent as he fires his last shots.\n\n“I think it’s the purest sign that we’ve abandoned procedural justice and are full-on in an outcomes-driven system,” Ellison said. “Blue lives matter, until they’re upholding the democratic transfer of power [on January 6]. This is a clear hallmark of fascism.”\n\nBlanche said this the same weekend that we learned that Good was still alive when paramedics reached her—not breathing, and with an erratic pulse, but a pulse nonetheless. At least 15 minutes earlier, moments after the shooting, a neighborhood doctor approached ICE agents and asked if he could check her pulse, and he was turned away. “I’m a physician!” he told them. “I don’t care,” the agent replied. I’d like to know that agent’s name and position. His actions merit investigation, too.\n\nNot only is the DOJ refusing to investigate Ross, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem instructed CBS’s Margaret Brennan not to even say his name on the air. “Don’t say his name! I mean, for heaven’s sake, we shouldn’t have people continue to dox law enforcement.”\n\n“His name is public,” Brennan replied. “I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said,” our puppy-killing cabinet secretary insisted.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\n“Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It’s disgusting,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. “Walz and Frey – I’m focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It’s a promise.”\n\nOn Sunday, Blanche told Bream, “You saw the Governor and the Mayor actively encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE. That is not allowed under our law… That’s what we’re looking at.”\n\nLast week, at least 10 Justice Department attorneys resigned because of the department’s failure to investigate Ross and the pressure to investigate Becca Good. Six came from the local US Attorney’s office, which also objected to shutting out local law enforcement and prosecutors from probing the shooting.\n\nNevertheless, Ellison says his office and Moriarty’s are already investigating the shooting, interviewing witnesses, and collecting evidence through an online portal. While some analyses hold that it’s tough for state officials to prosecute a federal agent, Ellison insists otherwise. “No, it isn’t,” he told me. “No, it isn’t. All cases prosecuting law enforcement are difficult,” he acknowledged, but “to say the states have to abandon their power to maintain order in their state? We have the legal right to prosecute and the legal right to investigate.”\n\nThough Ellison said he wasn’t “shocked” by Blanche’s brazen assertion that the Justice Department isn’t investigating Ross, he did admit it was proof that “we are in another kind of moment.” Before Trump, he said, the Justice Department “would have at least done some kind of investigation, assembled a grand jury,” while in the end likely clearing the agent. The notion that the administration no longer has to even pretend to follow the law—Trump last week said only his own “morality” constrains him—puts is in “dangerous” territory, he said.\n\n“The big danger is thinking there’s going to be some ‘snapback’ moment,” he added. “There will not be one that we don’t ourselves create.”",

    "fullText": "This essay was originally published on Substack. To see the original, or to comment on the piece, click here\n\nIn this essay I’d like to introduce you to the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins’ work on kings, and how it can help us to understand not only the relationship of Venezuelans to Trump, but also the relationship between US Americans and Trump. Sahlins was the doctoral supervisor of the late David Graeber, who is one of my inspirations. Let’s begin with a review of one of Sahlins’ core concepts.\n\nReach back into history, and you’ll find mythological tales of the Stranger King repeated across different cultures.\n\nThese Stranger King stories have a common structure. They are generally set in some troubled ancient regime in which a local despot rules, surrounded by bickering elites. The despot finds himself challenged by a foreign stranger with mysterious, even supernatural, origins. The stranger is often young, handsome and violent, and has a willingness to bend societal norms (or step outside of them). The despot tries to outwit or outfight the newcomer, but is defeated by their trickery or sheer force. The outsider usurps the power and founds a new kingdom.\n\nThere are many examples of the Stranger King myth. Anthropologists have found them in Polynesia, Melanesia, Sulawesi and the East African Rift Valley, and Classicists can find many examples in Greek and Roman mytho-histories. See, for example, this overview by Olaf Almqvist in which he demonstrates the stranger-king credentials of rulers like Aeneas, Pelops, Cyrus the Great, and Sargon of Akkad (even the mythical founder of Rome - Romulus - has a Stranger King vibe).\n\nIn fact, dynasties will often seek to trace their origins back to an ancient Stranger King. For example, the 16th century Mexica ruler Moctezuma reportedly said that he descended from a lineage of “strangers who immigrated hither from a very distant land”1.\n\nIf we talk about Stranger Kings, however, we also have to talk about the legendary anthropologist Marshall Sahlins (1930-2021), who took time to analyse them. His writing on Stranger Kings began in 1982, but his last work on the topic was a collaboration with the late David Graeber in 2017, in a book called On Kings (you can find an open access version of it here). In it, Sahlins and Graeber note some key features of the Stranger King:\n\nIn some ways this is a more sophisticated take on the ‘might is right’ concept. The stranger king might be monstrous, but by stepping outside of normal rules, he creates a mystique, a sense that he has access to powers beyond the ordinary world, and this can become a source of legitimacy.\n\nEqually important, however, according to Sahlins, is that the Stranger King enters into some kind of social contract with the conquered people.\n\nNot only will the woman domesticate the otherwise dangerous outsider, but local elites see opportunities to reform themselves around the Stranger King, seeing in this external power the potential to overcome their own internal divisions or turmoil.\n\nSo, while Stranger King myths might involve heroic, violent, or otherworldly power grabs, they aren’t necessarily stories of straightforward conquest. In fact, they are often stories of usurpation, and Sahlins notes that this pattern actually occurs in various, fairly recent, historical situations.\n\nThis framing of Stranger Kings gives us a more multi-faceted lens through which to view colonisation, because, in the words of Sahlins:\n\nThe take-away point is that colonists are seldom experienced in black-and-white terms, precisely because they often arrive into the already grey context of pre-colonial politics, with different sections of an indigenous population - with different agendas - seeing in them different things.\n\nAt this point it’s important to flag up that colonists always have a vested interest in claiming that they are warmly welcomed by the local population. European colonists, for example, imagined themselves as ‘bringers of light’ on a mission to ‘civilize savages’ living in a ‘primitive’ state of turmoil and godlessness. That said, anti-colonial narratives face the opposite problem, in that they can overemphasise the lack of agency in a colonised population. Sahlins’ discussion of Stranger Kings highlights the ambiguity in foreign takeovers, because the arrival of the violent outside ‘King’ might present opportunities for local elites, who may be prepared to collaborate with, or take a chance on the external power. They may see certain uses in the distant, aloof, strangers, who don’t seem to be subject to the same rules of engagement as the locals are.\n\nThis approach was applied by David Henley, for example, when he found evidence that the indigenous Minahasa on Indonesia found a certain usefulness in the 17th century Dutch East India Company, in particular because Stranger Kings tend to have “aloofness from local rivalries” and an “ability to provide relatively impartial conflict resolution”. The Dutch East India Company was unambiguously self-interested, colonial and extractive, but the point is that, rather than being mere meek bystanders to its history, local people had ambiguous entanglements with the corporate giant. They experience the coercive violence of the colonist, but may still take a gamble on a Stranger King.\n\nOn January 12th 2026, Donald Trump posted a picture of himself on Truth Social, with the tag ‘acting president of Venezuela’. His takeover of the country is unambiguously colonial. Like all colonial ventures, however, there are many who will find ways to justify it.\n\nFor example, the conservative press has predictably fixated on the pre-existing dictator - the figure of Maduro - and his spectacular humiliation and overthrow at the hands of a cunning outsider brimming with almost supernatural vitality. There are stories about the jubilation of exiled Venezuelans, weeping with joy and thanking Trump.\n\nThen we have all the stories about the blatant geopolitics of this. Unlike George W. Bush during the Iraq War, Trump has made almost no effort to disguise the fact that the regime change is all about THE OIL. In fact, he’s loudly proclaimed that it’s about the oil. He’s gone out of his way to talk about how US multinationals will literally take over the country. This makes it very easy for the left wing press to point out the very obvious imperial dynamics of this resource grab. Hell, even the centrist and conservative press are struggling to ignore that.\n\nLet’s forget about the global press response, though. Through the eyes of many Venezuelans, we have here all the elements of a potential Stranger King situation. Ok, Trump isn’t a young, handsome challenger, but he certainly is a foreigner who doesn’t feel encumbered by traditional rules. In fact, the blatant impunity of his oil grab adds to the sense of awe and mystique around him, and he has certainly deposed a local despot.\n\nAt the risk of pushing the framework too far, we even find strange echoes of the mythological ‘marriage to the daughter’ element of the traditional Stranger King story: the female power players of Venezuela, like Delcy Rodríguez and Maria Corina Machado, must now domesticate the irascible outsider by entering into deals with him.\n\nCrucially, while it’s true that the US actions have thrown the Venezuelan establishment into turmoil through violence, there already was turmoil in the pre-colonial situation, so this new incursion has simultaneously opened up new opportunities for local elites (and exiled elites), some of whom have long been seeking some way out of the situation. This could be a usurpation, rather than conquest, with potential for elites to strike a new ‘social contract’ with the foreign power.\n\nLet’s take a moment, however, to unpack that loaded phrase, and how it relates to the Stranger King concept.\n\nThe term ‘social contract’ is heavily associated with classic liberal theory, and classic liberal theory is a heavily abstract way of thinking about the world. When I say ‘liberal’ here, I don’t mean it in the modern US political sense, but rather in the original philosophical sense: early liberal philosophers - like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke - basically started from the assumption that humans are:\n\nFrom that opening position they then describe social formations as collections of individuals who have rationally come together. This sets the scene for mainstream economics, which basically says exactly the same thing, but applies it to economic interactions.\n\nIn the case of standard economists, they imagine individuals ‘choosing’ to ‘come together’ to ‘form markets’, but in the case of our 17th century Hobbes, he imagines rational individuals choosing to come together to form… well… a kind of absolutist monarchy to rule over them (which is partly why Hobbes is often misinterpreted as being ‘illiberal’).\n\nIn his Leviathan (1651) he explains that a monarch is a creation of individuals, who have chosen to give up part of their freewheeling-but-chaotic freedom (which they would have in a ‘state of nature’) in order to enter into a more constraining social contract with a monarch, in which the monarch will provide some structure - like property rights, law and order - so that the individuals can pursue their self-interest without being disrupted by disputes, theft, instability or in-fighting.\n\nIn it’s own context, Hobbes’ Leviathan was an attack on the idea that monarchs derive their power from a god (hence him being accused of atheism), but by describing kings as the secular creation of individuals, he also implied that individuals could dissolve the social contract if necessary, and return to being in a ‘state of nature’.\n\nThis was a politically radical statement to make in the context of 17th century England, but as a generalised account of actual human history it is kinda bullshit, precisely because - like all classic liberal theory - it starts from the ahistorical assumption that humans are individuals and that social formations are ‘chosen’. In reality, every person in history has always been born into an existing social context (aka. societal enmeshment always precedes any perception of being an individual, rather than the other way around) and it’s only in edge cases that we find a random collection of fully-grown adults who are somehow untethered and able to explicitly make some new ‘social contract’ with each other (for example, the only time I’ve ever experienced a ‘social contract’ was when I became naturalized as a British citizen, and - in the ceremony - was given a literal list of my rights and obligations, but of course no British-born person has ever seen this, and none of them ever ‘chose’ to ‘enter into’ the contract).\n\nStill, the edge cases are important, and in many ways Stranger King myths describe one type of edge case. In a pre-existing society in a state of turmoil, it is possible for a foreign ruler to appear as a type of ‘Leviathan’ figure that can be ‘contracted’ with by allowing them to usurp. This might make some kind of rational sense to people entangled in an otherwise intractable conflict, who can dissolve some previous entanglement by jumping ship to the new one.\n\nThis is not to say that this will work out for the people involved, but this does help us to move past binary perspectives on the current Venezuela situation. On the one hand, I find Trump to be an obnoxious narcissist - and he’s now upping the stakes to being an unapologetic coloniser too - but I can still understand the gamble being taken by, for example, a Venezuelan exile who agrees to grant some leeway to him.\n\nLet’s conclude by going one layer deeper. Perhaps the Stranger King myth is crucial to the entire Trump show, beyond his current Venezuelan adventures.\n\nThink about it. In the run-up to his political campaigns, Trump has always presented himself as some kind of heroic outcast - a prodigal son in exile, shunned by The Establishment. The twist here is that he’s not technically a foreigner in the US, but he fashions himself as a local son that’s estranged from his true home, unfairly misrepresented by the New York Times, mocked by Hollywood, disrespected by Time Magazine.\n\nFrom this starting point, the mythology unfolds. The estranged son returns as a Stranger King with a celestial mandate, on a mission to form a ‘contract with the people’ against the despotic ‘deep state’. This justifies overriding all pre-existing norms, checks and balances.\n\nIn Making Capitalism Bad Again, I noted that at least part of the euphoria that surrounds Trump comes from the fact that he gave permission to people to ignore the cognitive dissonance that characterises liberal versions of capitalism - the sense that you’re supposed to be a Good Boy and a Bad Boy at the same time - and, by taking on the ‘bad boy’ mantle, he indeed appeared as a monstrous outsider not subject to the niceties of the society.\n\nIn presenting himself as above and beyond existing norms, he could take on that Stranger King immunity. Through this lens, actions previously considered reprehensible - like attacking the press, centralizing power into the executive, threatening the judiciary, defunding the universities, sending in the National Guard to quell protests etc - can all be framed as signs that the Stranger King isn’t subject to the rules of the realm, and thereby draws his power from some distant, mystical source. That becomes a sign of his legitimacy in the eyes of his followers.\n\nReturning the Sahlins, the Stranger King often comes to power not through conquest, but by usurpation aided and abetted by a local population who see in them a certain usefulness. There are many people who voted for Trump not because they particularly like him, but simply because they took a chance on him, seeing him as the proverbial Stranger, and ignoring his obvious inconsistencies, hypocrisies and flaws, while focusing on his outsider status, which gives him a quasi-supernatural vibe that may be worth taking a gamble on.\n\nGiven that Trump is heavily narcissistic, however, this Stranger King story probably plays out in his own head. He is now triumphant, yet remains deeply vulnerable, incredibly thin-skinned and increasingly maniacal. The Trump show might fly in 2024, but as time goes by, and as he gets increasingly lost in his own mythology about himself, he loses sight of those that brought him to power.\n\nAs he screws over the US shale gas industry by flooding the US with Venezuelan oil in an attempt to deal with inflation caused by tariffs, or sides with the Big Tech barons who couldn’t give a rat’s ass about the rust belt, or disses the CEO of Exxon Mobil, he makes more and more enemies of those who took that gamble on him. Everyone smiles deferentially at the Stranger King, but it’s entirely possible that they’re all waiting for that moment when a newer, younger, and more handsome stranger sets foot in the land.\n\nThis essay was originally published on Substack.

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "fullText": "Stock markets went into a global selloff this morning as world leaders at Davos woke up to the news that U.S. President Trump had written to the prime minister of Norway to say that his repeated threats to take over Greenland were based on the fact that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize … I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump’s message to Jonas Gahr Støre said. “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”\n\nThe Norwegian government has no control over how the Nobel Committee awards its prizes. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, not Norway.\n\nLate last night, Trump posted again on social media, “NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”\n\nTraders, dismayed by the prospect of a renewed trade war between the U.S. and Europe, reacted by driving down equities all over the world.\n\nS&P 500 futures were down 1.12% this morning—an unusually steep drop. The last session closed flat. (Markets in the U.S. are closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.) The STOXX Europe 600 fell 1.25% in early trading, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.49% before lunch. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.65%. China’s CSI 300 was flat. India’s NIFTY 50 was down 0.42%. Bitcoin declined to $93K. The only major national index having a good day was South Korea, where the KOSPI rose 1.32%.\n\nGold, the traditional safe-haven investment, hit a new record high of $4,673.4 on the Comex continuous contract.\n\nWall Street’s analysts broadly agree that President Trump’s repeated threats to force Denmark to “give back” Greenland and to impose an escalating series of trade tariffs on the U.K. and E.U. if those countries don’t comply are bad for equities globally. They differ only in their assessment of how bad this will get.\n\nING’s Carsten Brzeski and Bert Colijn told clients, “Overall, we can only repeat our earlier estimates that additional tariffs of 25% would probably shave 0.2 percentage points off European GDP growth. However, this model-based estimate definitely falls short in capturing the full impact of new uncertainty and geopolitical tensions as a result of escalated tensions.”\n\nThey also cautioned, “As has been the case before, it is not exactly clear how this will work out as there has been no official communication from the White House, yet, just Trump’s announcement on social media.”",

    "fullText": "The billionaires and business execs are hitting the slopes.\n\nA sleepy ski town tucked in the Swiss Alps is being taken over by the world's elite (and a bunch of journalists) for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n(If you want to see how you get to this town, here's how I did it. And no, it wasn't by private jet.)\n\nYour immediate reaction to Davos might be a massive eye roll. Davos has gotten a reputation in recent years as a gathering of the elite who are out of touch with everyday people.\n\nThis year, though, some of the biggest topics at Davos will impact everyone. You can follow everything that's going on in our live blog and with our special Davos newsletter.\n\nTrump: In all honesty, the conversation around Davos largely starts (and arguably ends) with the president's appearance on Wednesday. He famously skipped attending the event in person last year (he had just been inaugurated). Instead, he offered a blistering virtual address that largely attacked the rest of the world.\n\nThis time, he's coming with a big contingent, and it's the talk of the town. He's already said a focus of his speech will largely be affordability, interestingly choosing a US-specific issue on the global stage. (It is America First, after all.)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is also coming to town. He plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure. It's another example of the ever-evolving future of capitalism, a topic we've been closely covering this year.\n\nTariffs: Tariffs have been a staple of Trump's second term, and they don't appear to be going anywhere. Their impact is also felt worldwide, making them a perfect fit for the global Davos crowd.\n\nTheir latest iteration is a threat Trump is wielding against countries that oppose his plan to take over Greenland. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said controlling Greenland is actually about Trump trying to avoid conflict.\n\nAI: You didn't think you'd get through this without an AI mention, did you? Last year, the word of the conference was \"agentic AI.\" This year it feels like three letters will be top of mind: ROI. The bets have been placed, and they are big, but what is AI doing for companies?\n\nAlso expect some chatter about how the tech is affecting workforce headcounts.",

    "fullText": "If you have been hoping for a $2,000 tariff rebate check, it may not come.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave mixed messages about the issues in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\n\"You've promised $2,000 checks to Americans based off of your tariff revenues. When can they expect those?\" Times reporter Katie Rogers asked.\n\n\"I did do that? When did I do that?\" Trump said. \"Yeah, I'm thinking. Well, I did $1,776 for the military.\"\n\nWhen Tyler Pager, another Times journalist, followed up, asking when the checks would come, Trump replied that \"the tariff money is so substantial.\"\n\n\"That's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime,\" Trump said. \"I would say toward the end of the year.\"\n\nIn November, Trump posted on Truth Social proposing a $2,000 payout to all US citizens with low or middle incomes, because the government is \"taking in so much money\" from tariffs. According to a recent Supreme Court filing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government may have collected around $1 trillion in tariffs.\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\"\n\nEven if the Supreme Court doesn't rule his tariffs enacted under emergency powers unconstitutional in its coming decision, revenue generated by the duties may be spread too thin for a payout to Americans.\n\nLater in the interview with the Times, Trump said that the tariff revenue will go toward reducing federal government debt and funding national defense.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, the national debt as of January is around $38.40 trillion, and rose by $2.17 trillion in 2025. If Bessent's estimate on tariff revenue is correct, the total amount collected over the past year would cover less than 50% of the increase in debt.\n\nTrump also recently called for increasing the defense budget to $1.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2027. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the move would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump has promised or suggested a number of payouts to Americans in his second term, including a $5,000 DOGE check, a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers with perfect attendance during the government shutdown, $1,000 to Trump Accounts for children who are citizens, and a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for active military members.\n\nAs for whether Trump even has the power to issue the checks, Congress, not the presidency, has the power of the purse and can make those appropriations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "The Supreme Court is about to weigh in on the Fed's independence in a case that goes beyond Jerome Powell",
    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",
