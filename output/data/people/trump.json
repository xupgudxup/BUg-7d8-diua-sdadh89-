    "fullText": "MarketsBy Matthew Griffin, Janet Freund, and Jordan FitzgeraldSaveAn upcoming US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the sweeping tariffs that President Donald Trump rolled out in April — briefly sending markets worldwide into a tailspin — could be the next test for stocks that have been flying high. The S&P 500 Index has since rallied 39% from the lows hit that month. It closed at a record high Thursday, in part because tariffs have settled lower than Trump’s highest threats, while support has come from an artificial-intelligence investment boom and a US economy that has kept expanding fast enough to throw off record corporate profits.",

    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some featuring powerbrokers like Bill Gates and Larry Summers.\n\nThe photos — which also feature President Donald Trump, ex-Trump advisor Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, writer-director Woody Allen, Richard Branson, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew — are a selection of the over 95,000 photos that the Democrats say were provided to the House Oversight Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nSome of the photos also include Ghislaine Maxwell, a onetime partner of Epstein who was convicted of trafficking girls to him for sex. She's currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nThe committee previously released other records obtained from Epstein's estate, including images of his US Virgin Islands home and tens of thousands of emails and text messages between Epstein and other powerful people.\n\nThe images themselves aren't indications of wrongdoing.\n\nIn many cases, it isn't clear when the photos were taken. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and agreed to register as a pedophile. In 2019, he killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on more severe sex-trafficking charges from federal prosecutors.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement: \"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Gates, Summers, Bannon, Clinton, Allen, Branson, and Mountbatten-Windsor did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that House Democrats are once again \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"\n\nThe latest release of images comes as the Department of Justice readies to release a trove of Epstein-related documents. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, requires the Justice Department to make its files related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell public by December 19.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends,\" Jackson said.\n\nBelow are some of the 19 images that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published on Friday:",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

The late child sex offender, it seems, didn’t just have records of the guests who visited his place in the Caribbean.\n\nAmong the physical records he kept were sex toys, according to news reports, including a novelty condom with a likeness to Donald Trump. Behind the table, there’s a sign reading Trump Condom $4.50.\n\nIn addition, there were pics of former US President Bill Clinton with Jeffrey’s girlfriend and conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nSee the newly released photos here: https://t.co/nBf2Y0q1I0\n\n— Oversight Dems (@OversightDems) December 12, 2025\n\nThe details of what transpired on Jeffrey’s island are disturbing enough to hear. All of these new photos add yet another element of shock. The Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published the findings on their X account on Friday, attaching a Dropbox folder for all to see.\n\nDonald and Bill aren’t the only celebrities seen in the photos. Among the others are Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Steve Bannon, Woody Allen, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nIn their big reveal, none of the released photos were dated. Names of potential victims and identifying details were redacted. The latest collection supposedly contains over 95,000 images, with 19 revealed on Friday. Representative Robert Garcia says that these disturbing photos raise more questions about Jeffrey and his relationship with some powerful people. In early December, the Oversight Committee released photos of Jeffrey’s island.\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in relation to Jeffrey and sex trafficking, their relationship is being scrutinized more than ever. Congress passed a bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files last month, something which the President officially signed. The deadline to release the details of that investigation is December 19.\n\nTELL US – SHOULD THOSE CELEBRITIES IN THE PHOTOS HAVE TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT THEIR TIME ON JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S ISLAND?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Condoms and Adult Toys: New Jeffrey Epstein Images Released appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration is arguing that requiring real-time American Sign Language interpretation of events like White House press briefings “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,\" part of a lawsuit seeking to require the White House to provide the services.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House.\n\nThe National Association for the Deaf sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the cessation of American Sign Language interpretation — which the Biden administration had used regularly — represented “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House’s real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” The group also sued during Trump's first administration, seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a June court filing opposing the association's request for a preliminary injunction, reported Thursday by Politico, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” also writing that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration’s image and messaging as he sees fit.”\n\nGovernment attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday on the ongoing lawsuit or answer questions about the administration's argument regarding the damage of interpretation services to Trump's “image.”\n\nIn their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn’t provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association.\n\nAs home to Gallaudet University, the world’s premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out.\n\nLast month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply.\n\nOn his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible\" with the department's mission,\n\nThis week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP",

Mike Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday, discussing plans to dramatically lower regulatory oversight on cannabis and its derivatives, giving them the same classification as many standard prescription painkillers.\n\nIt's also not the only bullish regulatory development for pot stocks.

    "title": "Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses in his repayment overhaul is facing bipartisan backlash",
    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Americans are deeply skeptical of President Donald Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, though he is shoring up support",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Americans are deeply skeptical of President Donald Trump's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, though he is shoring up ​support among his core Republican followers who have long focused on the case, a ‌new Reuters/Ipsos poll found.\n\nThe poll, completed on Monday, found that most Americans believe Trump's administration is covering up information about ‌the late sex offender, including his 2019 death and his ties to rich and powerful people, and do not believe Trump's claim that he was unaware of Epstein's alleged trafficking of teenage girls when the two were friends decades ago.\n\nOnly 23% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the ⁠ongoing scandal, the poll found, while ‌52% disapprove.\n\nHowever, the poll found he appears to be easing the concerns of his supporters: 53% of Republicans said they approved of the way he was ‍handling the issue, up from 44% last month. That is still well below the 85% approval rating Trump enjoys overall among Republicans.\n\nThat could prove crucial. Trump stoked conspiracy theories about Epstein before he returned to the ​White House this year, and prominent supporters have accused his administration of a cover-up.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats ‌in Congress defied Trump last month and passed a law requiring the Justice Department to release documents by December 19 from its long-running investigation into Epstein.\n\nThe online poll of 4,434 U.S. adults, conducted December 3 through December 8, found lingering suspicion about the U.S. government's role.\n\nSome 62% of those surveyed, including 56% of Republicans, said they believed the government is hiding information about Epstein's death, ⁠which was ruled a suicide, in a Manhattan jail in ​2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.\n\nAn even ​higher proportion - 70% - said they thought the government is hiding information about people who may have participated in the late financier's alleged sex trafficking of teenage girls, ‍including 62% of Republicans.\n\nAnd only ⁠18% said they thought it was likely that Trump did not know about Epstein's alleged crimes before they were made public. Among Republicans, that figure was 34%.\n\nTrump has said ⁠he was not aware of Epstein's activities, and says he broke off their friendship before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 ‌to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly two dozen House Republicans joined Democrats Thursday to pass a bill that would restore collective bargaining rights for hundreds of thousands of federal employees, an attempt to overturn an executive order that President Donald Trump issued earlier this year.\n\nThe measure passed 231-195 after reaching the floor through a bipartisan maneuver that bypassed GOP leadership — a so-called “discharge” tactic that is being used with growing frequency as Republicans seethe over dysfunction in the chamber. The bill still needs Senate approval to become law, but 20 Republicans sided with Democrats in a rare break from the president.\n\nThe executive order that Trump issued in March aimed to end collective bargaining for employees of agencies with national security missions across the federal government. He said he had the authority to revoke the rights under a 1978 law.\n\n“Reinstating these rights is not a concession — it is a commitment. A commitment to treat federal workers with dignity, to reinforce a resilient public service, and to honor the commitment of the men and women who show up for the American people every single day,” GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a co-sponsor of the bill, said on the floor before passage.\n\nTrump's order targeted the union rights of roughly 600,000 of the 800,000 federal workers represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, including those at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense.\n\nThe union is challenging those moves in court, arguing they are illegal and retaliatory. In May, an appeals court said the administration could move forward with the executive order while the lawsuit plays out.\n\nIn a statement after Thursday's vote, the AFGE said it “extends its deep appreciation to every member of Congress who voted for the bill.” The group's president, Everett Kelley, called it a “seismic victory.”\n\nThe bill's approval was also praised by the AFL-CIO, the biggest labor federation in the U.S.\n\n“We commend the Republicans and Democrats who stood with workers and voted to reverse the single largest act of union-busting in American history,” said Liz Shuler, the group's president.\n\nThe bill reached the floor through a discharge petition led by Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine. It’s a tactic that has been used with increasingly frequency this Congress due to frustrations with GOP leadership, including in the high-profile push to force release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Any lawmakers can force a vote on legislation if their petition gains 218 signatures, a majority in the 435-member House.\n\nAll House Democrats who voted supported the measure to restore the bargaining rights. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries supported the bill, saying on the floor prior to its passage that it would help “public servants who have been targeted viciously by the Trump administration from the very beginning of his time in office.”\n\nWhile passage in the Republican-held Senate appears unlikely, the vote represented one of the chamber’s first formal rebukes of the president and the flurry of executive orders he has issued during his second term.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nStill, most of the Republicans who backed the bill still held back from directly calling out the president. Speaking on the House floor before voting in favor of the bill, New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler said that “earlier this year, an executive order changed the collective bargaining status.”\n\n“Every American deserves a voice in the workplace, and that includes the people who keep our government running and open,” said Lawler.\n\nOf the 20 Republicans who backed the bill, many, including Fitzpatrick, face tough reelections next year. It comes at a time when some Republicans, following Trump's lead, have become more supportive of labor unions, long a key part of the Democratic Party's coalition.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties in Trump's first term, was among the Republicans to support the bill, but told reporters prior to the vote that he wasn't trying to send a message to the president with his vote.\n\n“No message here at all,” said Van Drew. “This is a New Jersey message. I got to take care of my people. And I’ve always been supportive of unions.”",

    "fullText": "MAGA Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump amid their high-profile divorce.\n\nThe Georgia Republican told CBS News that she is “starting to feel very sorry” for the 79-year-old, saying that his attacks on her reflect poorly on him.\n\nThe great schism began when Greene, 50, broke with him on the cost-of-living crisis, which Trump insists is a “hoax,” and the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nThe escalation saw Trump call her a “traitor,” and the one-time MAGA die-hard decided to quit Congress.\n\nDuring the CBS News interview, MTG said that Trump’s refusal to embrace the economic realities facing many Americans could cost the GOP its majority next year.\n\n“I do believe at this time that Republicans will lose the midterms, and I think that’s unfortunate,” Greene said. “I very much wanted to be part of a Republican majority in Congress that solved problems for the American people, that delivered what we promised to America.”\n\nGreene’s interview was released 24 hours after Trump sat down for a wide-ranging interview with Politico’s Dasha Burns on The Conversation podcast.\n\nAsked what he’d rate himself on the economy, Trump said, “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.” As the Daily Beast has previously reported, Americans have given a markedly different assessment.\n\nAnd so does Greene. Speaking on CBS News, she offered more advice to Trump. “The president needs to be aware that he’s a billionaire president of the United States,” she said.\n\n“You can’t gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable, and you can’t tell them that the economy is in A-plus-plus-plus. You just can’t do that, and I think it’s insulting to people’s intelligence,” she added, dropping two plusses from Trump’s grade.\n\nGreene made a similar prediction about the midterms when she announced on Nov. 21 that she intended to quit Congress in January 2026.\n\nIn a message shared on X, she said, in part, “I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms.”",

    "fullText": "The GOP-aligned Heritage Foundation think tank sparked a wave of condemnation on Thursday after it posted a threat from President Donald Trump to defund Indiana if the state doesn’t pass his gerrymander.\n\n“President Trump has made it clear to Indiana leaders: if the Indiana Senate fails to pass the map, all federal funding will be stripped from the state,” wrote Heritage Action on X, adding:\n\nRoads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame.\n\nTrump has been pressuring Indiana to redraw its Congressional map to eliminate any Democrats holding seats in the state. The deep red state had previously shot down the idea in its Senate, but has since revived the effort under threats from Trump. Trump previously pushed Texas to redraw it map to favor the GOP, which in turn led California to move to eliminate Republican seats.\n\n“If Republicans will not do what is necessary to save our Country, they will eventually lose everything to the Democrats. Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again. One of my favorite States, Indiana, will be the only State in the Union to turn the Republican Party down!” wrote Trump in a lengthy post on Wednesday.\n\nRod Bray is a state senator in Indiana opposed to redistricting, which is extremely rare mid-decade and usually only done after a census.\n\nPundits and observers, including many well-known conservatives, expressed their shock at Heritage’s threat:\n\nSetting new precedents for the next Democratic Administration. https://t.co/GMQpxLlvNo\n\n— Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) December 11, 2025\n\nThe president and one of the most influential conservative groups in the country are threatening to deprive all Indiana residents of paved roads, guard bases, and major projects if they don't pass an extremely gerrymandered map to deprive voters of choice.

    "description": "Trump's administration announced an agreement to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Borrowers would have to transfer to new plans.",
    "fullText": "It's looking like SAVE can't be saved — and it'll mean millions of borrowers could soon face higher monthly payments.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced a settlement with the State of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nSince last summer, SAVE — created by former President Joe Biden — has been paused due to litigation from Missouri and other GOP-led states. The plan was designed to provide affordable monthly payments to the 7 million enrolled borrowers, along with a shorter timeline for loan forgiveness.\n\nIf a court approves the settlement, the department will stop accepting new applications to SAVE, require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan, and resume payments.\n\nThe Trump administration is \"bringing an end to this deceptive scheme,\" Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of education, said in a statement. \"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back.\"\n\nThe proposed settlement is pending court approval, and borrowers will not face any changes until the court finalizes it. If the settlement is approved, borrowers will have \"a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and resume repayment.\n\nIn addition to the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE, the Department of Education said that 450,000 borrowers have \"expressed interest in enrolling in the plan\" and will be affected by the settlement, as well.\n\nThe proposed settlement said that the department would deny pending applications and help borrowers transition out of SAVE, and it would undergo negotiated rulemaking — which includes negotiations with stakeholders on the department's proposal — to effectuate the settlement.\n\nThe department did not provide a timeline for the negotiated rulemaking process.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that borrowers who transition out of SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments. She referred to the Repayment Assistance Plan, a new plan the department is set to launch in July 2026, which would allow for loan forgiveness after 30 years.\n\n\"It is less generous in terms of monthly payments, and also to the extent that you have to be in the program longer before you can get forgiveness,\" Fast said.\n\nWhile the department resumed interest charges on SAVE plan accounts in August, enrolled borrowers previously had until 2028 to transition to a new plan. This proposed settlement accelerates that timeline, and it would be a significant undertaking for servicers to carry out, Fast said.\n\nAbby Shafroth, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center, said that eliminating SAVE \"without access to a clear and affordable alternative is reckless and short-sighted, creating even more needless confusion, uncertainty, and financial stress for millions of Americans already struggling with the rising cost of living.\"\n\n\"In the midst of a national affordability crisis, their way forward is murky and complicated,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia must be freed from immigration detention while he fights his deportation, a judge ruled Thursday, handing a major victory to the immigrant whose wrongful deportation to a notorious prison in El Salvador made him a flashpoint of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let Abrego Garcia go immediately, writing that federal authorities had detained him again after his return to the United States without any legal basis.\n\n“For this reason, the Court will GRANT Abrego Garcia’s Petition for immediate release from ICE custody,” the judge wrote.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security sharply criticized the decision and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling “naked judicial activism” by a judge appointed during the Obama administration.\n\n“This order lacks any valid legal basis, and we will continue to fight this tooth and nail in the courts,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary. The judge gave prosecutors until 5 p.m. EST to formally respond to the release order.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment, and messages seeking comment from Abrego Garcia’s attorney were not immediately returned.\n\nAbrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national with an American wife and child, has lived in Maryland for years but entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could not be deported to El Salvador because he faced danger from a gang that targeted his family. When he was mistakenly sent there in March, his case became a rallying point for those who oppose President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement actions.\n\nA court later ordered his return to the United States. Since he cannot be removed to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries. His federal suit claims the Trump administration is illegally using the removal process to punish Abrego Garcia for the public embarrassment caused by his deportation.\n\nIn her order releasing Abrego Garcia, Xinis wrote that federal authorities “did not just stonewall” the court, “They affirmatively misled the tribunal.” The judge was referencing the successive list of four African countries that officials had sought to remove Abrego Garcia seemingly without commitments from those countries, as well as officials' affirmations that Costa Rica withdrew its offer to accept him, a claim later proven untrue.\n\n“But Costa Rica had never wavered in its commitment to receive Abrego Garcia, just as Abrego Garcia never wavered in his commitment to resettle there,” the judge wrote.\n\nXinis also rejected the government’s argument that she lacked jurisdiction to intervene on a final removal order for Abrego Garcia, because she found no final order had been filed.\n\nSeparately, Abrego Garcia is asking an immigration court to reopen his case so he can seek asylum in the United States.\n\nHe is also criminally charged in Tennessee, where he has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling. He has asked the federal court to dismiss the case, arguing the prosecution is vindictive. His defense attorney in Tennessee, Sean Hecker, declined to comment.\n\nA judge in that case has ordered an evidentiary hearing after previously finding some evidence that the charges “may be vindictive.” The judge also noted several statements by Trump administration officials that “raise cause for concern,” including a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful deportation case. ___\n\nLoller reported from Nashville, Seewer reported from Toledo, Ohio and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

    "description": ", Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s repeated mockery of the word “affordability” is worrying Republican strategists, who say the fixation",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s repeated mockery of the word “affordability” is worrying Republican strategists, who say the fixation risks undercutting White House efforts to reassure Americans about the cost of living - a top voter concern heading into next year’s congressional elections.\n\nThose fears were ​underscored during Trump's speech to supporters in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. The White House billed the speech as the first in a series by the president to address ‌criticism that he is not paying sufficient attention to voters who say they are struggling with high prices.\n\nInstead, the 90-minute speech veered into attacks on the word \"affordability,\" which Trump derided as a \"hoax\" by Democrats to exaggerate the cost ‌of living. While he did acknowledge that prices were high, he insisted the economy was booming and people were taking home more pay.\n\nBut Republican strategists told Reuters the president should stop fixating on the term \"affordability\" and instead focus on presenting a clear plan to lower prices.\n\n“Repeating this claim that affordability is made up ignores what’s happening in our economy,” said Jason Cabel Roe, a Republican consultant. “He absolutely needs to do better.”\n\nGovernment data shows that job growth has slowed during Trump’s second term, unemployment has risen to its highest level in four years and consumer prices remain high. Overall, the economy’s ⁠growth has rebounded somewhat after the economy contracted slightly in the ‌first quarter of the year.\n\nWHITE HOUSE DEFENDS TRUMP ON AFFORDABILITY\n\nA person who speaks regularly with Trump's top aides, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk more freely about messaging, said some of those aides conceded that the president needs to talk more about the domestic economy, ‍especially ahead of the midterm elections next November, with Republicans' control of both houses of Congress at stake.\n\nTwo White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied that Trump's dismissive comments about affordability made him appear out of touch with the struggles of ordinary Americans, although they acknowledged that was a complaint from some Republican lawmakers.\n\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai defended Trump’s focus on the economy, calling the rally “a reminder for ​everyday Americans that the Trump administration continues to prioritize affordability.\"\n\nTrump's approval rating edged up to 41% in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll as he rolled back some tariffs on food imports ‌and spoke more about combating inflation. But the approval rating on his performance on the cost of living was just 31%.\n\nOfficials have said Trump will hit the road in the new year to campaign for Republican candidates and emphasize his economic policy successes. Trump says his tax cuts and tariffs on foreign goods will put more money in the pockets of American families.\n\nSpeaking to reporters and technology executives at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said Democrats keep talking about affordability, but \"they never discuss it. They just say the election's about affordability. Well, it may very well be, I think it's also still about the border.\"\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted on social media that Trump spent his speech \"telling Pennsylvanians not to believe what they can see ⁠with their own two eyes - the skyrocketing cost of living and rising prices at the grocery store.\"\n\nOpinion ​polls show cost of living is voters’ top concern and was seen as contributing to a series of recent ​Democratic electoral victories.\n\nINDEPENDENT, MODERATE VOTERS WILL BE DECISIVE\n\nTrump told the rally, “I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” while blaming his predecessor, Democratic former President Joe Biden, for high prices.\n\nThat is an important message to send to voters, said John Feehery, a longtime Republican operative, but tone matters.\n\n“It’s very ‍difficult to tell people they’re fine when they’re ⁠not feeling fine,” said Feehery.\n\nCharlie Gerow, a Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist, said Trump’s remarks on Tuesday likely sounded “hollow” to moderates and independents, an influential voting bloc that Trump will need to win over if his party is to keep control of Congress.\n\nRepublicans currently have narrow majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.\n\n“He needs ⁠to stay laser-focused on the economy,” Gerow said. Meandering into topics like transgender rights and wind turbines, as he did on Tuesday, “doesn’t help,” he added.\n\nTrump has a crucial role to play next year as the party's chief economic ‌messenger, said Representative Richard Hudson, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n\"He's the most effective messenger we have,\" Hudson told Reuters.",

    "description": "The New York Times said it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest attack on the outlet for reporting on his age.",
    "fullText": "The New York Times said on Wednesday that it would not “be deterred by false and inflammatory language” in response to President Donald Trump’s latest claim that the outlet’s reporting on his age was an attempt to “libel and demean” him.\n\nThe paper said its audience deserved “in-depth reporting and regular updates about the health of the leaders they elect.” The statement came in response to Trump’s Tuesday attack against the paper, apparently over a November article focused on his declining energy, which argued the Times should “cease publication because they are a horrible, biased, and untruthful ‘source’ of information.”\n\n“Mr. Trump welcomed our reporting on the age and fitness of his predecessors; we’re applying the same journalistic scrutiny to his vitality,” spokesperson Nicole Taylor wrote in a statement. “Our reporting is heavily sourced, based on interviews with people clsoe to the president and with medical experts. We won’t be deterred by false and inflammatory language that distorts the role of a free press.”\n\nStill, such an approach to news coverage didn’t seem to resonate with Trump, who claimed again that his cognitive test results were something few people, “including those working at The New York Times,” could do very well.\n\n“Despite all of this, the time and work involved, The New York Times, and some others, like to pretend that I am ‘slowing up,’ am maybe not as sharp as I once was, or am in poor physical health, knowing that it is not true, and knowing that I work very hard, probably harder than I have ever worked before,” Trump wrote. “I will know when I am ‘slowing up,’ but it’s not now! After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean  ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.’ They are true Enemies of the People, and we should do something about it.”\n\nThe Times’ Katie Rogers and Dylan Freedman reported last month that Trump has started his events later in recent months and his public appearances had decreased. They wrote that, while “Trump and the people around him still talk about him as if he is the Energizer Bunny of presidential politics,” “the reality is more complicated.”\n\nTrump lashed out at the paper hours after the story published, calling Rogers “ugly, both inside and out” for writing the story and claimed then that the paper was an “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.”\n\nThe post New York Times Blasts Trump’s ‘False and Inflammatory’ Claim That Reporting on His Health Could Be Libelous appeared first on TheWrap.",

We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today.

Donald was on his way to Monroe County, Pennsylvania, at the time to deliver a speech. While the awkward moment was captured on tape, the President seemed to take it all with a grain of salt, having fun with it all.\n\n.@POTUS: \"You're going to have to take it easy with that thing. It's a government plane, but I like to take care of it.\"\n\nALWAYS WATCHING OUT FOR THE TAXPAYER! pic.twitter.com/i31QMF62XL\n\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 9, 2025\n\nWhat began as friendly banter with the press became a rather bizarre moment on the Presidential plane on Tuesday. Donald happened to be near the bathroom at the time before realizing someone was inside. The door happened to hit the President in the back.\n\nMembers of the media seemed to have a good chuckle over that, including the President, who told the person inside to “come on out.” The nameless person proceeded to close the door, perhaps out of fear of embarrassment or being identified.\n\nTuesday’s moment, while awkward, was one of the more light-hearted ones that we have seen involving Donald and the media. The President doesn’t seem to have a particularly healthy relationship with the press and has notably had very harsh responses to female reporters. He recently attacked Rachel Scott for her question about whether or not they’d release video of alleged airstrikes on Venezuela.\n\nDonald has also verbally attacked female reporters while aboard his plane. Catherine Lucy previously asked him about the Jeffrey Epstein files, prompting Donald to reply, “Quiet Piggy” to her. The Commander-in-Chief looked her dead in the eye and reportedly pointed at her when making the remark, according to reports.\n\nThe President playfully chastised somebody with a large boom mic during the Air Force One moment after they supposedly lost their balance.\n\nTELL US – DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HOW AGGRESSIVE THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WHEN ANSWERING THE MEDIA’S QUESTIONS?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Hit During Live Press Conference appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "Working at the White House might be one of the most exclusive and prestigious jobs in America, but you'd be surprised by how much some of the people around the president make each year.\n\nFor starters, having the top job — that is, being the president of the United States — brings in a salary of $400,000, which some independently wealthy presidents, such as John F. Kennedy, Herbert Hoover, and Donald Trump, have chosen to donate instead.\n\nWhile the figure is significantly higher than what the average American makes — $69,846 in 2024, according to the Social Security Administration — it's also less than you would need to be in the top 1% of earners across all US states.\n\nIn 2025, the top 1% of earners in Maryland and Virginia, which border the District of Columbia, make an annual $677,543 and $701,792, respectively.\n\nGovernment salaries can often fall behind what professionals make in the private sector, as serving the public isn't quite as lucrative as maximizing shareholder value. Still, to say that those working at the White House are underpaid would be an overstatement.\n\nOn July 1, the White House shared with Congress the salaries of all employees inside the president's executive office, including aides, advisors, and staff leaders, as it is legally required to.\n\nSome of the highest-compensated workers around the president include policy advisors and legal counsel, while others are responsible for the president's communications and personnel management. Lower-paid roles include research assistants and press assistants.\n\nA few at the top of the White House's payroll at the time of the list's reporting to Congress have since left their roles, like Taylor Budowich, who went to work for the private sector, or moved around the government, like Mike Waltz, who began acting as the US ambassador to the United Nations after being dismissed from his role as national security advisor.\n\nOther notable names, like Marco Rubio and David Sacks, declared a $0 salary from the office of the president due to either forgoing their salary or receiving compensation from other branches of government.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSee the 35 people who get paid the most inside the White House, after the president himself.\n\nRole: Senior immigration advisor\n\nKlopp, who earns the maximum salary possible in the senior executive service, is a top advisor to border czar Tom Homan and has worked in the government for over 17 years, including roles at the Department of Homeland Security and in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations, Fortune reported.\n\nAccording to Mkrtchian's LinkedIn profile, the attorney began working as an advisor for the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission in June 2024.\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for legislative, political, and public affairs\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for communications and public liaison and cabinet secretary\n\nBudowich left his role at the White House to work in the private sector in October. Neither Budowich nor the White House commented publicly on his departure.\n\nIn February, he was named in a lawsuit by the Associated Press over his move to block the outlet's access to the Oval Office and Air Force One after they refused to adopt Trump's naming of the Gulf of America.\n\nIn response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who was also named in the lawsuit, said, \"We feel we are in the right in this position. We're going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day.\"\n\nRole: Director of communications\n\nRole: Deputy assistant to the president and deputy special envoy to Ukraine\n\nRole: Special assistant to the president and deputy executive director of the National Energy Dominance Council\n\nIn October, Doffermyre began serving as the solicitor for the US Department of the Interior after being a senior advisor to the president for the first months of his second presidency.\n\nRole: Director of the Office of Management and Administration\n\nRole: Director of the Office of Presidential Personnel\n\nIn August, the president nominated Gor, who was then serving as the director of the Office of Presidential Personnel, as the US ambassador to India, and he was sworn into the role in November.\n\nRole: Director of the Domestic Policy Council\n\nRole: Chief of staff to the first lady\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for operations\n\nRole: Assistant to the president for economic policy and director of the National Economic Council\n\nRole: Special envoy for Ukraine and Russia\n\nRole: Senior advisor and senior director of power at the National Energy Dominance Council\n\nRole: White House press secretary\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for strategic implementation\n\nIn July, Matthews was sworn in as general counsel of the Department of War after serving as senior associate counsel to the president during the first months of his second term.\n\nRole: Deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security advisor\n\nRole: Senior counselor for trade and manufacturing\n\nAfter Sergio Gor was confirmed as the US ambassador to India in October, Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino took over as the White House's director of personnel.\n\nRole: National security advisor\n\nAfter the leak of Signal chats discussing US strikes in Yemen, the national security advisor was dismissed from his role and announced as the 32nd United States ambassador to the United Nations, a role he assumed in September.\n\nRole: Deputy director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Digital Assets\n\nRole: Director of speechwriting",

    "fullText": "Asked who was the funniest person he knew in real life, Elon Musk had a somewhat surprising answer.\n\n\"You know, President Trump is very funny. He's got a great sense of humor,\" Musk said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast released on Tuesday. \"He's very funny, he's like naturally funny. It's somewhat effortless.\"\n\nMusk pointed to President Donald Trump's meeting with New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani last month, when a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by his opinion that Trump is a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"And the president said, 'Just say yes. It's easier that way,\"' Musk said, breaking into laughter. \"'Don't worry about it. Just say yes.'\"\n\n\"How silly,\" Musk added after further laughter.\n\nElon Musk, who is a South African immigrant who votes in the US, is upset that Somali Americans in Minnesota get to vote. He's also saying that Zohran Mamdani won because the majority of people who voted for him weren't born in America. pic.twitter.com/6mToXTNV8y\n\nMusk's comments marked yet another turn in his evolving relationship with Trump. The two men appear to have mostly put their differences behind them, with Musk even visiting the White House for a dinner last month.\n\nStill, Musk said in that same interview that he wouldn't have led the DOGE effort if he could go back in time, despite believing the effort to be a \"little bit successful.\"\n\n\"I think instead of doing DOGE, I would have basically built, you know, worked on my companies, essentially, and the cars — they wouldn't have been burning the cars,\" Musk said.",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge has allowed a Tufts University student from Turkey to resume research and teaching while she deals with the consequences of having her visa revoked by the Trump administration, leading to six weeks of detention.\n\nThe arrest of Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying children's relationship to social media, was among the first as the Trump administration began targeting foreign-born students and activists involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy. She had co-authored an op-ed criticizing her university’s response to Israel and the war in Gaza. Caught on video in March outside her Somerville residence, immigration enforcement officers took her away in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nÖztürk has been out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center since May and back on the Tufts campus. But she's been unable to teach or participate in research as part of her studies because of the termination of her record in the government's database of foreign students studying temporarily in the U.S.\n\nIn her ruling Monday, Chief U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper wrote that Öztürk is likely to succeed on claims that the termination was “arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and in violation of the First Amendment.”\n\nGovernment argued that termination was legal\n\nThe government’s lawyers unsuccessfully argued that the Boston federal court lacked jurisdiction and that Öztürk’s Student and Exchange Visitor Information System record (SEVIS) record was terminated legally after her visa was revoked, making her eligible for removal proceedings.\n\n“There’s no statute or regulation that’s been violated by the termination of the SEVIS record in this case,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a hearing last week. The Associated Press sent an email Tuesday seeking comment from Sauter on whether the government plans to appeal.\n\nIn a statement, Öztürk, who plans to graduate next year, said while she is grateful for the court's decision, she feels “a great deal of grief” for the education she has been “arbitrarily denied as a scholar and a woman in my final year of doctoral studies.”\n\n“I hope one day we can create a world where everyone uses education to learn, connect, civically engage and benefit others — rather than criminalize and punish those whose opinions differ from our own,” said Öztürk, who is still challenging her arrest and detention.\n\nThe then-30-year-old was one of four students who wrote the opinion piece in the campus newspaper. It criticized the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nÖztürk, who is Muslim, was meeting friends in March for iftar, a meal that breaks a fast at sunset during Ramadan, according to her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai. Her student visa had been revoked several days earlier, but she was not informed of that, her lawyers said. The government asserted that terminating her SEVIS record two hours after her arrest was a proper way of informing Tufts University about her visa revocation.\n\nA State Department memo said Öztürk's visa was revoked following an assessment that her actions “‘may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause with an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”\n\nÖztürk running out of time to pursue teaching, research goals\n\nWithout her SEVIS status reinstated, Öztürk said she couldn't qualify as a paid research assistant and couldn't fully reintegrate into academic life at Tufts.\n\n“We have a strange kind of legal gaslighting here, where the government claims it’s just a tinkering in a database, but this is really something that has a daily impact on Ms. Öztürk’s life,” her attorney, Adriana Lafaille of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in court.\n\n“We are running out of time to make this right. Each day that goes by is a day that she is being prevented from doing the work that she loves in the graduate program that she came here to be part of. Each day that this happens is a day that the government is allowed to continue to punish her for her protected speech.”\n\nÖztürk, meanwhile, has maintained a full course load and fulfilled all requirements to maintain her lawful student status, which the government hasn't terminated, her lawyer said.\n\nRecord created to collect information on international students\n\nSEVIS is mandated by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and administered by the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement “to collect information relating to nonimmigrant foreign students” and “use such information to carry out the enforcement functions of” ICE.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, when a SEVIS record is terminated, a student loses all on and/ or off-campus employment authorization and allows ICE agents to investigate to “confirm the departure of the student.”\n\nMcCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country intends to send more water to the United States, but not immediately, even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to raise tariffs by 5% on Mexican imports if more water is not delivered as part of a water-sharing agreement.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico is proposing a water delivery this month and another one in the coming years. The proposal will be discussed in a virtual meeting with U.S. officials Tuesday, she said.\n\nMexico is behind water deliveries to the United States from the Rio Grande River because of drought and pipeline limitations, Sheinbaum said.\n\nUnder a 1944 treaty, Mexico must deliver 1.7 million acre-feet of water to the U.S. from six tributaries every five years, or an average of 350,000 acre-feet every year. An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover 1 acre of land to a depth of 1 foot.\n\nTrump posted on social media Monday that Mexico has a water debt that has accumulated over five years and that is affecting farmers in Texas. He said that he has authorized a 5% increase on tariffs on Mexico if the water is not immediately released.\n\n“The U.S needs Mexico to release 200,000 acre-feet of water before December 31st, and the rest must come soon after,” Trump wrote. “As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water.”\n\nTrump first threatened tariffs over the water issue in April when he also threatened to impose 5% tariffs on Mexican imports and accused the country of continuing to violate the agreement.\n\nThe two countries have reached agreements on the issue in the past and the Mexican president said she hoped they would again find an understanding.\n\n“We have the best intention to deliver the amount of water that is owed from previous years,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is standing by his tariffs, at least in theory.\n\nUnder the banner \"Lower Prices, Bigger Paychecks,\" Trump kicked off the first of a series of speeches to promote his economic message in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, as polls indicate the country is increasingly concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\n\"They always have a hoax,\" Trump told the crowd, referring to criticism from Democrats that his policies drove up prices. \"The new word is 'affordability.'\"\n\n\"Democrats are like, 'prices are too high.' Yeah, they're too high because they cause them to be too high,\" Trump added. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nLater, he said, \"I can't say affordability is a hoax because I agree the prices were too high. So I can't go to call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"\n\nTrump, during the 90-minute speech, also reiterated that his favorite word is \"tariff\" and credited his policies for bringing in \"hundreds of billions of dollars,\" presumably for the government in tariff revenue.\n\n\"You can give up certain products,\" Trump said at one point. \"You could give up pencils. Because under the China policy, you know, every child can get 37 pencils. They only need one or two, you know. They don't need that many.\"\n\nDespite standing by his tariff policies, Trump has, in reality, rolled back many of his earlier tariffs, especially ones enacted on April 2.\n\nTariffs are still higher than they have been in many decades, but the original 25% tariff on every import from Mexico and Canada was walked back to exclude all items covered in the USMCA trade agreement, which includes most imports from the two neighbors. Tariffs on imports from China, once more than 100%, have been reduced to a baseline tariff of 10%, which applies to all other countries.\n\nOn top of that, in an attempt to address the price of groceries, Trump also modified and removed tariffs on a range of food products in November, such as beef, coffee, bananas, and tomatoes.\n\nOf the remaining tariffs, evidence points to an impact on the price of consumer goods.\n\n\"Our analysis suggests that tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments, and our model-based regressions confirm that these effects are statistically and economically significant.\"\n\n\"At the same time, the pass-through remains partial; only a portion of the model-predicted effect has materialized so far,\" the report added. \"This could reflect delays in price adjustments, competitive pressure limiting firms' ability to raise prices, or expectations that the tariffs may prove temporary.\"\n\nTrump's speech comes as consumer sentiment remains low. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n\nEarlier on Monday, in an interview with Politico, Trump said that he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nSome Democrats have centered their pre-2026 midterm messaging on affordability, and several have explicitly blamed rising costs on Trump's tariff and trade policies. Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, with whom Trump had a meeting, also won while running primarily on making the city more affordable.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday refused to step aside as requested by President Donald Trump's former attorney who faces felony forgery case related to the 2020 election in the battleground state.\n\nThe judge also refused to cancel a Monday preliminary hearing for Trump's former attorney, who also previously worked as a judge in the same county where he is being prosecuted, and two other former Trump associates.\n\nThe three former Trump aides face 11 felony charges each in relation to their roles in the 2020 fake elector scheme. They are: Jim Troupis, who was Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin in the 2020 election; Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who advised Trump's campaign; and Mike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day operations in 2020.\n\nTroupis, joined by the other two defendants, argued in a motion filed Monday that all of the judges in Dane County were biased against him. Troupis was a judge in the county for one year from 2015 to 2016.\n\nHe also alleged that the judge hearing his case, Dane County Circuit Judge John Hyland, had solicited help from a retired judge in writing an August order refusing to dismiss the case against him.\n\nTroupis argued in the motion that the retired judge who “carries personal animus” toward Troupis from their time together on the bench actually wrote the order. Troupis asked for an evidentiary hearing in another county.\n\nHe included an expert analysis of the writing style that compares the order to the writing style of retired Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Troupis' attorney also attached a Nov. 25 letter he wrote to Hyland claiming that other attorneys told him that Remington actually wrote the August order because the writing style matched Remington’s in a civil case they litigated before him.\n\nHyland rejected those arguments and Troupis' call for moving the case to another county.\n\n“The Court is satisfied that no person other the assigned staff attorney and I had a hand in drafting or editing the decision which this Court signed and entered,” Hyland wrote.\n\nHyland also wrote that he had “no personal animus or prejudice toward any of the litigants” and was satisfied that he could fairly hear the case. He declined to step aside as requested.\n\nHyland also said that Troupis presented no evidence to support his claim that every other judge in the country was prejudiced against him and therefore can’t fairly hear the case.\n\nTroupis’ attorney, Joe Bugni, did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nTroupis, Chesebro and Roman each face 11 felony charges for allegedly using forgery in an attempt to defraud each of the 10 Republican electors who cast their ballots for Trump in 2020 as part of a plan to submit paperwork falsely claiming that the Republican had won the battleground state that year.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin in 2020 but fought to have the defeat overturned. He won the state in both 2016 and 2024.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Justice, which is prosecuting the case, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe state charges against the Trump attorneys and aide are the only ones in Wisconsin. None of the electors have been charged. The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis all settled a lawsuit that was brought against them in 2023.\n\nFederal prosecutors who investigated Trump’s conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, said the fake electors scheme originated in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint details how Troupis, Chesebro and Roman created a document that falsely said Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes and then attempted to deliver the document to then-Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe Trump associates have argued that no crime took place. But the judge in August rejected their arguments in allowing the case to proceed.\n\nA judge threw out a similar case in Michigan in September. And last year, a special prosecutor dropped a federal case alleging Trump conspired to overturn the 2020 election. A Georgia election interference case was dropped by prosecutors earlier last month, and another similar case remains in Nevada.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's top AI advisor is seeking to clear up any confusion about the administration's AI preemption plans.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X on Monday, White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks said that a forthcoming executive order to restrict states' ability to regulate AI is \"an attempt to settle a question of jurisdiction.\"\n\nSacks, a venture capitalist and a co-host of the \"All In\" podcast, sought to address various concerns about AI preemption, which has proved to be a controversial topic even within Trump's coalition.\n\nHe called those concerns the four Cs — child safety, communities, creators, and censorship.\n\nRegarding communities, Sacks said that AI preemption has little to do with the construction of data centers, which have become a political flashpoint in states around the country due to those centers' heavy water and energy demands.\n\n\"AI preemption would not apply to local infrastructure. That's a separate issue,\" Sacks wrote. \"In short, preemption would not force communities to host data centers they don't want.\"\n\nHe also said that state laws requiring platforms to protect against online predators and child sexual abuse material would remain in effect, because AI preemption wouldn't apply to \"generally applicable state laws.\"\n\nONE RULEBOOK FOR AI\n\nI wanted to share a few thoughts on AI preemption and address some of the concerns.\n\nFirst, this is not an “AI amnesty” or “AI moratorium.” It is an attempt to settle a question of jurisdiction.\n\nWhen an AI model is developed in state A, trained in state B,… pic.twitter.com/tO3yyc0A8M\n\nThe administration appears to be moving forward with an effort to curtail state power to regulate AI, arguing that forcing companies to comply with competing regulations across 50 states will hamper the US's competitiveness in the AI race with China.\n\nWhile it's unclear exactly what's in the forthcoming executive order, a draft seen by Business Insider last month would direct the Department of Justice to sue states over \"onerous\" AI laws.\n\nIt comes after multiple attempts to enact AI preemption via Congress, most notably in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" That provision was ultimately struck from the bill before passage due to opposition from several Republicans.\n\nSacks wrote on X that the administration will \"continue to work with Congress to define a federal framework that can be enacted through legislation.\" But that hasn't stopped the pushback from other Republicans.\n\n\"Nice framework,\" replied Republican Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio. \"This should be a law, not an executive order.\"",

    "description": "Trump announced a proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Borrowers would resume payments \"in the coming weeks.\"",
    "fullText": "The door is about to permanently close on a major student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Education announced a proposed settlement with the State of Missouri, which, if approved, will officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan established by former President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden rolled out the SAVE plan in July 2023, which was intended to provide student-loan borrowers with affordable monthly payments and a condensed timeline for debt relief. In April 2024, Missouri joined other GOP-led states in filing a lawsuit challenging the plan. Borrowers enrolled in the plan have been on forbearance since last summer, while the legal challenges continued.\n\nThe department said in a press release that, should the court approve the settlement, the department will not enroll any new borrowers in SAVE, deny pending applications, and move all enrolled borrowers to existing repayment plans.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. \"Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nIf the settlement is approved, the department said that borrowers enrolled in SAVE \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan and begin repaying their loans. The department and federal servicers are expected to reach out to SAVE borrowers in the coming months with more information.\n\nTrump's administration has indicated its intent to end the SAVE plan for months, with a phase-out of the plan by 2028. The announcement of this proposed settlement accelerates that timeline. On August 1, the Department of Education resumed interest charges on SAVE borrowers' accounts, and the Education Sec. Linda McMahon said at the time that she recommended borrowers transition to \"a legally compliant repayment plan,\" like income-based repayment.\n\nThe department is working to carry out changes to expand eligibility for income-based repayment, like removing the requirement to have partial financial hardship, which is set to be completed in December 2025. The \"big beautiful\" spending legislation that Trump signed into law also included plans to eliminate SAVE and introduce two repayment options for borrowers, effective July 2026.\n\nIt's unclear when these changes will take effect. However, borrowers who leave SAVE will likely face higher monthly payments should they enroll in a different plan.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.\n\nThe trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.\n\nThe president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.\n\n“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem, and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”\n\nThe president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nAs home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.\n\nIt's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.\n\nTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads during Trump's visit on the Wilkes-Barre Times-Leader website that criticize Bresnahan for his stock trading while in Congress and suggest that Trump has not as promised addressed double-dealing in Washington.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.\n\nWiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”\n\nThe challenge for Trump is how to address the concerns of voters about the economy while simultaneously claiming that the economy is enjoying an historic boom.\n\nAsked on a Politico podcast about how he'd rate the economy, Trump leaned into the grade inflation by answering “A-plus,” only to then amend his answer to “A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nTrump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.\n\nTrump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.\n\nThe U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.\n\nSince the elections in November when Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and a “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",

    "fullText": "California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) is emerging as as the early Democratic favorite for the 2028 White House race, according to a new survey that also shows young voters turning sharply against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Yale Youth Poll, an undergraduate-led project, questioned 3,426 registered voters nationwide, including a hefty oversample of 1,706 people aged 18 to 34.\n\nOf all Democratic potentials, despite no one having declared their candidacy, Newsom leads the primary field with 25%, ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris at 18%, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) at 16%, and ex-Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg at 14%.\n\nIn a separate electability test, Democratic voters rated Newsom the strongest general election option, with 85% judging him most likely to beat a generic Republican opponent.\n\nAmong Republican participants, Vice President JD Vance dominates a Trump-free 2028 primary, pulling 51% among GOP voters. But when respondents are asked to imagine an unconstitutional third term for Trump, the president still takes 50%, with Vance slumping to 19% – a reminder of how tightly the party’s current form remains bound to Trump. Younger Republicans are notably cooler, with Trump failing to win majority support among voters under 30.\n\nAccording to the poll, Trump’s appeal among young people has soured since his narrow spring 2025 uptick. Voters aged 18 to 34 now disapprove of his performance by margins of 30 points or more, and Democrats hold double-digit leads with every under-35 age band on the generic congressional ballot.\n\nStrategically, Republicans say they want more Trumpism, not less, with 55% of GOP voters who want the party to prioritize turning out its base. Democrats, by contrast, are split between firing up their core voters and moving to the center, a dilemma now playing out against a generational backdrop in which Newsom looks increasingly like the party’s compromise candidate between youth appeal and perceived electability.\n\nThe online survey was conducted in English by Verasight between 29 October and 11 November 2025 and has a margin of error of ±1.7 percentage points for the full sample.\n\nThe post New Poll Reveals Clear Democratic Favorite in 2028 White House Race first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Online sellers and freelancers in the U.S. have found changes to the 1099-K reporting threshold headache-inducing at best over the past couple of years, but a recent change in IRS policy will come as a relief to many.\n\nCongress enacted a rule to change the 1099-K threshold for your 2025 taxes, meaning you should only receive a Form 1099-K if you receive more than $20,000 in gross payments on third-party networks or payment apps and you also conduct more than 200 transactions on a single platform within the tax year (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThis is good news for those who have a side hustle like driving Uber or casually sell items online. The threshold should ensure that only those who are seriously engaged in selling goods or services through a third-party platform are responsible for the extra tax paperwork, and are likewise taxed appropriately on their profit.\n\nHere’s the backstory on the Form 1099-K confusion, and why you can now rest easy if you’re looking to make some casual money on the side — without having to worry about extra tax forms.\n\nInitially, the “$600 rule” statute that changed the requirements for 1099-K forms meant that all taxpayers who earned $600 or more on platforms like PayPal, Venmo or Cash App would have to complete the additional form and be taxed on that income. However, in an effort to soften the impact on both these third-party companies and on taxpayers, the IRS announced a $5,000 threshold for 2024 taxes — a way to “phase in” the implementation of the $600 threshold (2).\n\nThis caused confusion for many over the past few tax seasons, and many taxpayers received 1099-K forms they weren’t expecting.\n\nThe National Taxpayers Union Foundation (NTUF) lobbied hard against the changes, arguing that a drastic drop in the reporting threshold would cause the resulting confusion about forms and reporting, and could also trigger taxes for things like receiving money transfers from friends, with taxpayers having to report higher incomes than they really earned.\n\n“The 1099-K course correction is a big win for transparency, simplicity and common sense,” wrote Demian Brady, vice-president of research at NTUF (3).",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "description": "Chemical industry lobbyists have long pushed the government to adopt a less stringent approach to gauging the cancer risk from chemicals, one that would help ease regulations on companies that make or use them.",
    "fullText": "The chemical industry finally got its wish.\n\nIndustry lobbyists have long pushed the federal government to adopt a less stringent approach to gauging the cancer risk from chemicals, one that would help ease regulations on companies that make or use them.\n\nLast week, in a highly unusual move, the Environmental Protection Agency embraced that approach in announcing that it is revising an assessment of the health dangers posed by formaldehyde, a widespread pollutant that causes far more cancer than any other chemical in the air. Working on that effort were two of those former industry insiders, who are now top EPA officials.\n\nThe proposed revisions to the assessment, released Wednesday, nearly double the amount of formaldehyde considered safe to inhale compared with the version that was finalized in the last weeks of the Biden administration. Even that older assessment significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation published last year found.\n\nUnder previous Republican and Democratic administrations, EPA scientists were instructed to assume that chemicals that cause cancer by damaging DNA — the largest group of carcinogens, which includes formaldehyde — pose a “linear” risk, meaning that even small exposures can be dangerous. The agency adopted the approach almost 40 years ago to protect against the multitude of low-level cancer threats the public faces daily. But the industry’s favored method assumes that certain carcinogens pose no risk at lower levels and that the danger should only be considered once exposure reaches a certain threshold.\n\nThe Trump administration has already criticized the use of the linear model for calculating the risk of cancer from radiation and could scrap its use in examining other chemicals.\n\nThe EPA’s adoption of this threshold model for formaldehyde might come as little surprise given that some of the scientists who have promoted the approach on behalf of companies are now running the agency.\n\nAmong them are Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, who both previously worked for the chemical industry’s main trade group, the American Chemistry Council, which represents more than 190 companies and has vigorously pushed back against the EPA’s efforts to regulate formaldehyde. As recently as 2022, Dekleva, then senior director of the trade group’s chemical products and technology division, wrote to an EPA scientist to advocate using the threshold approach in assessing the chemical. The EPA subsequently explored — and dismissed — the suggestion; the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine independently examined the decision and supported it.\n\nToday Dekleva serves as the deputy assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which conducted the formaldehyde assessment. Beck, a principal deputy assistant administrator who runs the office, signed off on the official agency memo that described the changes.\n\nAccording to federal conflict of interest rules, EPA employees are prohibited for a year from working on specific issues in which their former employer is a party or represents one, unless they first obtain written permission from the agency’s ethics office. Beck and Dekleva did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked about Dekleva and Beck’s involvement in the recent decision to change the agency’s approach to the risks of formaldehyde, an EPA spokesperson wrote in an email to ProPublica that Beck and Dekleva had obtained ethics advice from the agency that approved their work on the issue. “Because formaldehyde is produced by many manufacturers and is used across many industrial sectors, this risk evaluation is not a specific party matter that raises concerns for them under the federal ethics rules,” the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson described the changes to the formaldehyde assessment as corrections of past scientific mistakes. “Through a rigorous peer review process, we determined the Biden Administration used flawed analyses in its risk assessment of formaldehyde,” the spokesperson wrote. “We are correcting the record to reflect the best available science and our core statutory obligations.”\n\nThe assessment released under Biden found 58 situations in which workers or consumers face an unreasonable risk to health from formaldehyde — a designation that requires the agency to mitigate it. Among the items that can emit dangerous levels of the chemical are automotive-care products like car waxes, along with crafting supplies, ink and toner, photographic supplies and fabrics, building materials, textiles and leather goods. The EPA is reversing the finding that formaldehyde presents an unreasonable risk to health in five situations while leaving dozens more standing. One of those five involves the manufacturing of wood products.\n\nThe agency contends that the level of formaldehyde the EPA now says is acceptable under the revised assessment will protect people from cancer and the other harmful effects, which include asthma, miscarriage and fertility problems.\n\nBut environmental advocates see the Trump administration’s reversal on cancer risk as a reflection of industry’s influence over the agency.\n\n“The science on formaldehyde hasn’t changed; these are the same arguments that the chemical industry’s been peddling for the last decade,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, an attorney at Earthjustice, the country’s biggest public interest environmental law firm. “The only difference is that they’ve finally found an administration willing to ignore the findings of its own scientists.”\n\nFor decades, formaldehyde has been at the center of bitter battles between industry and regulators. Sometimes described as the backbone of American commerce, the chemical is used in everything from binding particleboards in furniture to serving as a building block in plastic and preserving bodies — and has fierce defenders in many sectors.\n\nOur investigation identified significant levels of formaldehyde inside cars, stores and our own homes. ProPublica’s analysis of EPA data also determined that, in every census block throughout the country, the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde in outdoor air over a lifetime is higher than the limit of one incidence of cancer in a million people, the agency’s goal for air pollutants. According to our analysis, some 320 million people — nearly all Americans — live in areas of the U.S. where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor exposure to formaldehyde is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal.\n\nAs of last year, official EPA estimates put the average risk from formaldehyde in the air at 20 times higher than the limit. But, as our investigation found, that number does not reflect the risk of myeloid leukemia, a potentially fatal blood cancer. (EPA scientists calculated that risk but, because of internal disputes about its certainty, left it out of their final number.) When myeloid leukemia is included, the cancer risk from formaldehyde jumps to 77 times higher than the limit.\n\nFormer EPA veterans fear that the threshold approach to evaluating cancer risk could be applied to ease health-based protections on other carcinogens. “This will open the floodgates,” said Tracey Woodruff, a scientist at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine who worked at the EPA for 13 years. “Chemical companies want every carcinogen to be considered a threshold carcinogen, which would allow them to say that their chemicals are safe when we know that is not true.”\n\nThe agency is in the process of producing risk evaluations for several other potentially cancer-causing chemicals, including 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,3-butadiene, which are used in plastics manufacturing. These decisions are especially consequential because, after the EPA finalizes a rule based on the assessment, states are prohibited from issuing their own protections on the same chemical.\n\nThe EPA can finalize its proposed changes to its formaldehyde assessment after the public comment period ends on Feb. 2. Then it must issue a rule that addresses any unreasonable risk posed by the chemical.\n\nThe Trump administration is also taking aim at the use of the linear approach to cancer risk from radiation. An executive order issued in May deemed the method of assessing a chemical’s cancer risk to be flawed and directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to consider adopting new radiation exposure limits. Project 2025, the blueprint for the Trump presidency, similarly urges the EPA office that handles radiation to reassess the linear approach it has taken to cancer risk from radiation in the past. The EPA press office did not respond to a question about whether this work is underway.\n\nThe new revision to the formaldehyde assessment also marks a stark break with the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, an EPA program that quantified the health risks from formaldehyde last year. Previously, reports like the formaldehyde assessment, which was conducted under the federal chemicals law known as the Toxic Substances Control Act, have relied on values calculated by IRIS. But, in what appears to be an agency first, the EPA rejected the levels that the program calculated for the chemical last year.\n\nThe sidelining of IRIS was another item on the chemical industry’s wishlist and, with the EPA’s latest changes on formaldehyde, also appears to be near complete. Project 2025 called for the elimination of the program. Of 55 scientists who worked on its recent assessments, only eight remain in their jobs after a reorganization of the agency, ProPublica found in October. The EPA has still not published the most recent IRIS report, an assessment of the toxicity of the forever chemical PFNA, which was finalized in April.\n\nThe EPA did not respond to questions about when it plans to publish the PFNA assessment or the status of the program.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has opened the door for tiny cars to be sold in the US — and now Stellantis is bringing an Italian mini car to American shores.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed on Monday that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Michigan, Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said the Topolino's display appearances in the US had sparked \"tremendous excitement,\" adding that the company would share more details about the tiny car's US launch next year.\n\nThe Topolino, which means \"little mouse\" in Italian, is a major departure from the gas-guzzling big trucks that dominate US roads.\n\nBuilt by Italian brand Fiat, the compact city car has a max range of around 47 miles and a top speed of 28 miles per hour.\n\nWeighing less than a golf cart, it's technically classified as an electric quadricycle rather than a car, meaning that it can be driven from age 14 in some European countries.\n\nThe Topolino is available throughout Europe and costs around 9,900 euros ($11,500) in its home market of Italy. Its impending US launch follows a sudden burst of support for tiny cars from an unlikely source — Trump.\n\nThe US president expressed admiration for Japan's pint-sized Kei cars after a recent trip to the country.\n\nTrump described the mini electric models, which are hugely popular in Japan, as \"very cute\" and \"beautiful,\" and said last week that he had loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to build them in the US.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told CNBC the announcement of the Topolino's US launch was unrelated to Trump's comments. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKei cars have developed an enthusiastic cult following in the US, but the vehicles don't meet federal auto standards and can only be imported if they're over 25 years old.\n\nKei cars also face a patchwork of state regulations, with some states limiting them to low speeds or prohibiting them from being driven on public roads entirely.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's approval rating edged up to 41% in the past week as Republicans warmed to his handling of the cost of ​living, a sign the administration's new focus on affordability might be supporting his popularity, ‌according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nThe six-day poll, which closed on Monday, showed approval of the president rising from 38% late ‌last month, which was the lowest since Trump returned to the White House in January. Trump started his second term with a 47% rating.\n\nRepublicans performed poorly in a handful of state elections in November as Democrats hammered the Trump administration over persistently high inflation. But in recent weeks Trump has engaged more forcefully ⁠on the topic, scaling back some ‌of his tariff increases and pledging to combat high food prices.\n\nTrump has gone so far as to describe Democrats' focus on the issue as \"a hoax.\" He ‍is scheduled to give a speech on affordability and other economic issues on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a battleground state in national elections. Several congressional races in Pennsylvania will be competitive next year when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of ​Representatives are at stake.\n\nTrump's performance on the cost of living, where he got a 31% approval ‌rating, is among his weakest popularity scores. But that was up from 26% in late November.\n\nA 10-percentage-point gain among Republicans boosted his number, and 69% of Republicans rated him favorably on the issue. Some 85% of Republicans approved of his overall performance as president, up from 82% last month.\n\nU.S. inflation rates surged under Trump's predecessor in office, Democrat Joe Biden, and the economic pain helped Trump defeat Kamala ⁠Harris, Biden's vice president, in the 2024 presidential election. ​Inflation has remained elevated under Trump, with prices up 3% ​in the 12 months through September, above the historical norm of around 2%.\n\nThe uptick in Trump's popularity also owed to a modest increase in his approval among Hispanics, ‍a group that swung ⁠in Trump's direction in last year's election. Some 34% of Hispanics in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said they approved of Trump's performance in the White House, up from 32% in late ⁠November.\n\nThe latest survey gathered responses from 4,434 U.S. adults nationwide and was conducted online. It had a margin of error, ‌a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points in either direction.",

    "title": "ICEBlock Was Purged from the App Store. Now Its Creator Is Suing Trump",
    "description": "It became a lightning rod for the right—and a target for what its developer says was an attack on free speech.",
    "fullText": "In May, I published an early report on ICEBlock, the iOS-exclusive app that allows you to anonymously notify other users of the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers within 5 miles of your location. Since then, the app has been on a wild journey. A June CNN segment on ICEBlock and its coder, Joshua Aaron, got the attention of Attorney General Pam Bondi, who told Sean Hannity that Aaron should “watch out”; the app subsequently topped the charts at Apple’s App Store, as Republicans demanded that Bondi investigate Aaron’s creation. Trump whisperer Laura Loomer also got involved, revealing the identity of Aaron’s wife and getting her fired from her job with the Justice Department. The simultaneous trends of liberal uptake and conservative outrage continued until Oct. 2—when Bondi directly instructed Apple to remove ICEBlock from the App Store.\n\nNot only did the Big Tech giant comply, but it also removed other apps with similar ICE-notification and -documentation functions, to the protests of myriad Americans. (Google’s Play Store, which never hosted ICEBlock, also followed suit with those other, similar apps.) By the time it was delisted, Aaron tells me, ICEBlock had “over 1.14 million users,” and it was “adding 15,000 to 20,000 a day.”\n\nYet while ICEBlock got blocked, it may not stay that way much longer.\n\nOn Monday, Aaron filed a federal lawsuit against Bondi and three other Trump administration officials, including White House “border czar” Tom Homan, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing them of violating the First Amendment by coercing a private entity to censor speech and threatening prosecution over the exercise of protected speech. The 39-page suit, which requests a jury trial, asks the D.C. court to bar the Trump administration from demanding that Apple delist ICEBlock, or any similar immigration-advocacy app, ever again. The filing also requests relief on behalf of Aaron himself and his ALL U Chart company, which formally owns ICEBlock. The two plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Sher Tremonte, the law firm that recently won a federal court judgment ruling Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s efforts to detain and deport pro-Palestine student protesters to be unconstitutional free speech violations.\n\n“We’re seeking a declaratory judgment that this kind of coercion and the threats of prosecution against Joshua violate the First Amendment,” Sher Tremonte lead counsel Noam Biale told me. “And we are seeking an injunction from the court to prevent the government officials whom we’re suing from doing those things again.”\n\nNo one will know for a while yet whether the district court will even take the case up. Assuming it does, Aaron says, “the biggest goal here is to set a precedent”—to get the sort of judgment that could apply to ICEBlock and to the other ICE-related apps that have been taken down at the request of the feds. (Aaron adds, however, that he doesn’t plan to have other plaintiffs join his suit for now.)\n\nDespite the popularity of platforms like the ICE video archive Eyes Up and the interactive crowdsourced map People Over Papers, it does seem that ICEBlock remains the central symbol of this digital movement. Just this Friday, the House Committee on Homeland Security sent letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google, accusing them of still hosting “apps that allow users to report and disseminate data to reveal the location and identification of DHS law enforcement.” By way of erroneous example, the letter exclusively mentions ICEBlock, which does not collect or display anybody’s identity. But to the committee, that app has a special notoriety.\n\n“As you are aware … ICEBlock was used by a gunman to track the movement of ICE agents prior to a deadly shooting in September at an ICE facility in Dallas,” the lawmakers write, pointing to the incident where a 29-year-old Oklahoman purportedly wished to attack ICE agents but ended up killing two detainees and himself.\n\nTo be clear, there was no evidence that the shooter used ICEBlock at any point; FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted after the incident that the gunman had “searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents,” per USA Today. That pretext then inspired Bondi to again call out the media-famous ICEBlock in particular and get Apple to take it down. At the time, Apple told Fox Digital that “information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock” spurred the company to delist the app. The newsletter Migrant Insider later reported, citing “internal correspondence” Apple had sent to a different developer, that App Store moderators now treated federal officers as a “targeted group” on par with typically recognized marginalized ethnicities and identities (race, sexual orientation, origin), using that justification to deplatform apps with “location information … that can be used to harm” ICE agents.\n\nThat takedown alert was addressed to Deicer, a tool that “provides real-time alerts about ICE sightings through community reports, giving users the option to be an ‘observer’ and keep an eye out for authorities,” according to Syracuse University’s Daily Orange. But the same App Store guideline about “targeted groups” had already been weaponized against ICEBlock, per the lawsuit—and this was how “the first known instance of Apple removing U.S.-based apps in response to U.S. government demands” came about. (That being said, public means of tracking airplanes used by ICE are still available.)\n\n“Nothing had changed about ICEBlock, after all that vetting from their legal team over that five-week period of time” before it first hit the App Store, as Aaron told me. “They didn’t provide any evidence of law enforcement being targeted. They didn’t give me any information about what specifically they were provided by law enforcement.”\n\nAs Aaron also pointed out, the government’s rhetoric around ICEBlock tends to be either misinformed or disingenuous. Bondi told the Senate that Americans used the app to “post where ICE officers lived” (even though it did not pinpoint agents’ home residences) and claiming the DOJ also “worked with” Google to remove ICEBlock (even though it was never listed on the Play Store). The House committee’s letter to the Big Tech firms cited the Supreme Court’s landmark Brandenburg v. Ohio decision to imply that ICEBlock was not covered by free-speech statutes, as a supposed example of advocacy “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action,” or likely to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit counters such arguments by pointing out that the app does not upload or store any media or user data, and has time-limit guardrails for reporting. Plus, there’s a disclaimer stating that the app is “not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” Whether that will be enough to restore ICEBlock—itself classified as a form of speech in the suit—is yet to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, for anyone who still has ICEBlock on their phones, the app is still usable, Aaron says. “Yes, I cannot issue updates and you can’t download it again,” he added. “But we want to encourage people to still use it. It’s still just as private and anonymous as it ever was.”",

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Monday falsely denied making a comment he had made on camera just five days prior. Then he launched a personal attack against the reporter who had accurately repeated his previous remark.\n\nTrump has a long history of falsely denying he ever said things he had said in public.\n\nThe subject of his latest false denial was the video footage of the September 2 US military strikes against a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The military conducted a follow-up strike to kill the people who had survived the first strike.\n\nThe Trump administration publicly released the video of the initial strike but not the video of the follow-up strike, which has been shown to members of Congress behind closed doors. On December 3, Trump said he has no problem releasing this video to the American people.\n\nHere’s the December 3 exchange he had with ABC News reporter Selina Wang at the White House:\n\nWang: Mr. President, you released video of that first boat strike on September 2nd, but not the second video. Will you release video of that strike so that the American people can see for themselves what happened?\n\nTrump: I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release, no problem.\n\nOn Monday, another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, repeated Trump’s comment back to him while trying to ask a question about the potential release of the additional video. But the president denied he had said what he said:\n\nScott: Mr. President, you said you would have no problem with releasing the full video of that strike on September 2nd off the coast of Venezuela. Secretary Hegseth now says –\n\nTrump: I didn’t say that. That’s – you said that, I didn’t say that. This is ABC fake news.\n\nScott correctly noted, “You said that you would have no problem releasing the full vi(deo).” She then pivoted back to her question. She noted that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the question of whether to release the video is being reviewed, and she asked Trump if he is ordering Hegseth to release it.\n\n“Whatever he decides is okay with me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then offered a defense of the strikes, repeating his frequent false claim that each boat destroyed saves “25,000 American lives” and claiming the survivors “were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float, and we didn’t want to see that, because that boat was loaded up with drugs.” When Scott eventually interjected to try to return to the issue of releasing the video, he called her “the most obnoxious reporter in the whole place” and “actually a terrible reporter.”\n\nCNN has reached out to an ABC News spokesperson about the president’s remarks about Scott. Another ABC News journalist, Jonathan Karl, wrote on the social media platform X that Scott “quoted President Trump accurately.”",

    "fullText": "The Oval Office is looking a little bit different lately.\n\nEvery US president makes new interior design choices upon entering the White House, often reflecting their personal tastes or political views.\n\nIn his second nonconsecutive term, President Donald Trump has incorporated his love of maximalism and gold furnishings into the Oval Office.\n\nMore White House renovations are in the works. The East Wing was demolished in October to make way for the construction of a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom.\n\nTake a look inside Trump's redecorated White House to see the changes he's made since former President Joe Biden left office.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walked through the West Colonnade alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in May 2023.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden's use of an autopen and sought to invalidate Biden's pardons and commutations that were signed with the device.\n\nThe Palm Room leads out into the Rose Garden.\n\n\"New lobby leading to Oval Office — Magnificent marble floor, compliments of President Donald J. Trump!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAside from a presidential seal above the door to the West Wing, the walls were empty.\n\nThe gold lettering spelling out \"The Oval Office\" was set in the Shelley Script font. Trump also added a gold decal to the top of the door.\n\nThe rug, which featured the presidential seal in the center, was designed by Kaki Hockersmith, an interior designer based in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe rug's design includes the presidential seal, a sunbeam pattern, and olive branches along the border as a symbol of peace.\n\nTrump also used the rug during his first term.\n\nTrump's Oval Office features the flags of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the Navy.\n\nThe crown molding on the ceiling matched the cream wallpaper.\n\nThe gold embellishments matched the gold curtains, which remained in place from Biden's presidency.\n\nBiden also hung portraits of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton together to symbolize the benefits of different opinions, as well as portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump added more portraits with decorative frames to create an Oval Office gallery wall. He also replaced Biden's portrait of FDR with one of George Washington and displayed historic gold urns and baskets from the White House collection on the mantle.\n\nTrump's love of gold decor is well-known. His Trump Tower penthouse in New York City features numerous gilded ceilings, furniture pieces, and artwork. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, also includes a ballroom covered in gold from floor to ceiling.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt added the plaster relief of the presidential seal to the Oval Office during a 1934 White House renovation.\n\nBoth the seal and the stars surrounding it were covered in gold paint.\n\nThe hyperrealistic portrait, painted by Robert McCurdy, was unveiled at the White House in 2023.\n\nArtist Marc Lipp painted a rendering of an Associated Press photo that captured Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore it was used for press conferences and events, first lady Ellen Wilson originally designed the outdoor space as a formal flower garden in 1913.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump added a limestone border around the lawn in 2020.\n\nTrump told Fox News that the grass in the Rose Garden was impractical for large events because it stayed wet when it rained and was too soft for attendees who wore high heels.\n\n\"The grass just doesn't work,\" Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in March.\n\nWorkers began transforming the lawn into a patio in June, replacing the grass with concrete and stone tiles. \"The Rose Garden Club\" was completed in August.\n\nThe East Room, the largest state room in the White House, has a seating capacity of 200 people. When Biden hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in 2023, he held the state dinner in a tent outside the White House to accommodate the larger crowd of over 300.\n\nThe 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which the White House called a \"much-needed and exquisite addition,\" will cost approximately $300 million to construct. Trump and other \"patriot donors\" will foot the bill for the project, the White House said.\n\nLocated in the West Wing near the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room overlooks the Rose Garden and features a large, oval-shaped mahogany table purchased by President Richard Nixon in 1970, according to Obama's archived White House website.\n\nSeating at the table is assigned in order of when each department was established, with the oldest departments sitting nearest to the president.\n\nTrump chose portraits of past presidents, including George Washington, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower, to decorate the Cabinet Room.\n\n\"The vaults are where we have a lot of great pictures and artwork,\" Trump told reporters in July. \"And I picked it all myself, I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nThe eagle sconces were installed as part of a 2004 refurbishment of the Cabinet Room that also included a new rug, curtains, and paint color.\n\n\"Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in September. \"Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, 'freak out' when they see the quality and beauty.\"",

    "description": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that his winning pitch to Trump for the company to buy Warner Bros. centered on protecting and creating jobs.",
    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

Sales of its H20 chips to China during Q3 were \"insignificant,\" CFO Colette Kress said on its latest earnings call.\n\n\"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said during the Q3 earnings call.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls on chips.\n\n\"I've said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters last week.\n\nNvidia stock was up roughly 2% after hours.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

    "fullText": "\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry sounded early alarms about the subprime mortgage market's excesses — the same risks that later engulfed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nNow, Burry wrote in a Substack post on Monday that he owns \"good size\" positions in both companies' common stock — and believes a long-awaited plan to take them public again may finally be approaching.\n\n\"Once each company is released from capital restraint by their IPOs, I expect growth to accelerate naturally,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his 6,000-word analysis, Burry wrote that the mortgage giants contributed to the housing bubble by buying large volumes of risky loans that eventually blew up during the financial crisis.\n\nBurry recalled that he saw the danger early. In 2003, he called Freddie \"Frauddie Mac\" in an investor letter and bought credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company faltered.\n\nNow in 2025, Burry argues the landscape has changed. Fannie and Freddie have rebuilt tens of billions in capital since 2021 and remain essential pillars of the US mortgage market, owning 62% of outstanding home loans.\n\nWith the Trump administration now signaling interest in releasing them from conservatorship, Burry believes their IPOs may be nearing.\n\nHowever, \"there remains a final steep, windy and rocky climb to IPO for both,\" he wrote, citing regulatory and policy roadblocks.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which trade over the counter, rose 2% and 2.4%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nBurry's post came a month after he closed his hedge fund to outside investors, after terminating Scion Asset Management's SEC registration.\n\nSince then, he has launched his \"Cassandra Unchained\" Substack that promises a \"front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.\" It now has over 146,000 subscribers.",
