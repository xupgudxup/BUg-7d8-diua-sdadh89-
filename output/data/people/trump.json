    "fullText": "Another angle of federal agents killing a Minnesota legal observer, which appears to come from the direction of the woman in pink filming from the sidewalk.\n\nObtained by Drop Site News pic.twitter.com/IT56ftPkYP\n\n— Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) January 24, 2026\n\nHarrowing new close-up video of the ICE shooting death of a Minneapolis protester showed the moments leading up to the ultimate violent act.\n\nThe nearly three-minute video, posted to the X account of AZ Intel, began with protesters blowing whistles to warn others of the presence of ICE officers.\n\nA woman holding the camera was heard yelling, “What the f*ck is wrong with you?” as ICE agents went after a man who appeared to be holding a phone to record their actions.\n\nThe agents pushed another person wearing an orange backpack to the ground, then turned their attentions back to the protester they were pursuing, appearing to spray something in the man’s face.\n\n“What the f*ck, people? What the f*ck is wrong with you?” the woman yelled as ICE agents surrounded their target and dragged him to the ground. As ICE continued to wrestle with the man, a shot rang out, followed by multiple more shots as the officers moved away from the victim.\n\nThe woman holding the camera screamed and moved away from the scene before returning and yelling repeatedly, “What the f*ck did you do?!”\n\nThe video then showed the man lying on his back motionless as the ICE officers backed away, some with guns pointed at the victim.\n\nOthers were heard screaming in the background as the person with the orange backpack ran toward the woman recording.\n\n“Oh, my God, Oh, my God! What the f*ck did you just do?” the woman yelled repeatedly as the ICE agents stood over the man.\n\n“Someone call the ambulance!” the woman yelled over and over as another person yelled “Call 9-1-1!”\n\n“Somebody call 9-1-1! I can’t believe they just did that!” the woman recording screamed. “Holy sh*t, holy sh*t!” she yelled while recording an ice agent kneeling next to the victim.\n\n“Oh, my God, you f*cking people, man! You’re f*cking killing us!” she yelled. “Why would you do that?!”\n\nOne ICE officer then prodded the victim’s leg, but the victim did not move.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m seeing this!” the woman cried as more of the officers knelt around the man.\n\nThe victim was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nLater Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino gave a press conference during which he claimed the man had a gun and meant the agents harm.\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” he said.\n\nThe post WATCH: Stunning New Close-Range Video Of Trump Feds Shooting Man first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 100% tariffs on all Canadian goods and products exported to the US should Ottawa make a trade deal with China.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whom he called \"Governor Carney,\" against making a \"drop off\" deal with Beijing or face the levies.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,\" he added.\n\nCarney made an official visit to China last week — the first by a Canadian leader since 2017 — meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to discuss economic and trade opportunities between the two countries.\n\nIn a joint statement following the meeting, Ottawa and Beijing said they had committed to expanding bilateral trade and investment, as well as building cooperation in areas such as energy and agriculture.\n\nCarney also announced that Canada would now allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market on the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In return, he said Canada expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by March 1.\n\nTrump had initially said that the deal was what Carney \"should be doing\" and that it was \"a good thing for him to sign a trade deal.\"\n\nTrump's changing tone comes days after Carney delivered an impassioned speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he opined on the changing face of global politics since Trump's election.\n\n\"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" Carney, who did not explicitly name Trump, said, adding that \"middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu.\"\n\nTrump did not miss the opportunity to snap back at Carney during his own speech at Davos, saying the prime minister \"wasn't so grateful.\"\n\n\"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,\" he added.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump filed a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon on Thursday for closing his accounts allegedly for political reasons.\n\nHere is a look at Trump's claims and how the case could play out:\n\nThe largest U.S. bank closed accounts of several Trump businesses in ​April 2021 after they had been customers for decades, according to Trump's lawsuit. JPMorgan notified Trump of the closures about a month after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol ‌building on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump said the bank's motivation was political and that JPMorgan violated Florida law barring unfair trade practices and acted in bad faith.\n\nTrump also accused Dimon of ordering a malicious \"blacklist\" to warn other banks about doing business with the ‌Trump Organization, Trump family members and Trump himself. Trump said the publication of this blacklist amounted to trade libel under Florida law and said his businesses suffered considerable financial and reputational harm as a result.\n\nThe suit comes after Dimon criticized Trump's immigration policies and proposal to cap interest rates that banks charge on credit cards.\n\nJPMorgan denied wrongdoing, said the lawsuit had no merit and that it closes accounts that create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\n\nWHAT WILL TRUMP HAVE TO SHOW TO PREVAIL?\n\nThe case will likely boil down to whether Trump's legal team can prove the bank canceled the accounts because of his political viewpoints. Terms of banking ⁠agreements tend to strongly favor the banks, which do not need ‌to provide a reason for closing an account and customers often don't know why their accounts are terminated.\n\nIn this case, Trump said JPMorgan gave a 60-day notice of the account closure but did not provide a reason.\n\nBanks must monitor their customers for a variety of potential risks, and a customer who had an account ‍closed because of banned activity such as money laundering would have no grounds to challenge it.\n\nHowever, some reasons for terminating an account might be considered an unfair trade practice or bad faith, including closing an account due to a customer's religion or ethnicity.\n\nLegal experts said canceling an account because of an accountholder's political viewpoint, which JPMorgan said it does not do, would likely be impermissible.\n\nHowever, it might be legal if an accountholder's views were so extreme ​they undermined trust in the bank. Trump could argue that his political views were mainstream as he had just amassed more than 70 million votes in losing the November 2020 election.",

    "title": "Student-loan borrowers are facing debt-relief whiplash under Trump",
    "description": "Trump gave defaulted student-loan borrowers a major break on wage garnishment and tax refund seizure. Still, thousands are waiting for debt relief.",
    "fullText": "If there's one thing student-loan borrowers are familiar with, it's uncertainty — and there's a lot of that right now.\n\nAround the time it was set to take effect in early January, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it was pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted student-loan borrowers. This gives borrowers behind on payments more time to find a way back to good standing, but it's unclear how much time they'll have.\n\nAs to when that pause will lift, not even servicers appear to know. An employee at a major student-loan servicer told Business Insider that they received communications about the pause just days before it was announced to the public, and they do not know when garnishment and treasury offsets will resume.\n\nWhile the pause is good news for borrowers and provides them with relief as tax season commences, student-loan forgiveness backlogs continue to weigh on the thousands waiting for their relief to be processed. A recent court filing from the Department of Education said that 734,221 income-driven repayment applications were pending as of December 31, 2025, and that 3,400 discharges were approved in December.\n\nThe department wrote in its filing that litigation over the SAVE income-driven repayment plan is preventing it from processing some borrowers' debt relief applications. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments and a short timeline to debt relief, has been blocked since July 2024, and the department's filing said that it is focusing on processing income-based repayment discharges for borrowers who became eligible for relief before April 2025, the month that the block on SAVE was expanded in court.\n\nDuring this time, the department said that it is \"evaluating the most effective way to resume discharges for the borrowers who would have become eligible under the SAVE Plan Final Rule criteria after the date of the injunction. Currently, the only cancellations taking place are for IBR borrowers who became eligible before April 2025.\"\n\nThe pause on consequences for defaulted borrowers provides some relief, while the pause on forgiveness processing prolongs uncertainty — and, with more repayment changes on the horizon, student-loan borrowers have described feeling stuck in limbo, unable to financially plan. Some policy experts and lawmakers have also said that while the pause for defaulted borrowers is needed relief, the uncertainty could put borrowers at risk.\n\nThe department said in a press release last week that the delay in collections is intended to give borrowers \"additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\"\n\nWith all of the back-and-forth policy changes, it's difficult to keep track of what is, and isn't, happening for student-loan borrowers.\n\nThe main change that defaulted borrowers need to know is that their wages and other federal benefits should not be seized until the Department of Education announces that the pause is lifted.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options, which will support a stronger financial future for borrowers and enhance the long-term health of the federal student loan portfolio,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, borrowers should prepare for looming repayment changes, which were signed into law in Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nBeginning in July, the department will begin rolling out new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees. Additionally, over 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE could be kicked off the plan sooner than anticipated; the department announced a proposed settlement that, if approved, would give SAVE borrowers a limited time to enroll in a new plan and face higher payments.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, previously told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were among the Davos attendees. The luxurious airplanes matched the grandeur of the high-flyers who  went to the WEF.",
    "fullText": "Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\n\nThat meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.\n\nBusiness Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.\n\nOn Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.\n\nThe majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.\n\nOthers landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.\n\nFrom Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.\n\nThroughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nGulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.\n\nBusiness jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.\n\nIt's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.\n\nThese are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.\n\nSome governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.\n\nDue to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.\n\nSometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.\n\nBusiness Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.\n\nThe first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.\n\nA handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.\n\nIt's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.\n\nJetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThis is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nEmmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.\n\nHowever, it appears he left before Trump's speech.\n\nEven the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. \"Those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"\n\nMacron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.\n\nA Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.\n\nMore popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.\n\nTrump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.\n\nHowever, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.\n\nThis week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.\n\nHis press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.\n\nThe Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.\n\nHe flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.\n\nCarney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" he said.\n\nThe above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.",

Corey is the brains. He gets things done,” a senior administration official told Axios.\n\nLast week, an Axios reporter spotted Lewandowski standing at a gate at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where he was apparently discussing DHS vendor contracts loudly on the phone. The former Trump campaign chief specifically mentioned data company Palantir as well as a drone program, according to the outlet.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told Axios that Palantir has had a contract with the U.S. government for 14 years but that Lewandowski had never worked with Palantir and was not involved in the company’s government contract.\n\nLast year, however, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lewandowski had arranged for Noem to meet with Palantir and had told DHS officials to give the company additional work. Weeks later, DHS updated an existing contract to give Palantir an additional $29.9 million.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Lewandowski and DHS for comment.\n\nAs a special government employee, Lewandowski is allowed to maintain all of his private business interests and does not have to file a public financial disclosure form.\n\nHe is still subject to federal conflict of interest laws, but he refuses to say how he makes money, according to Axios.\n\nHe also remains close to the president, having managed Trump’s presidential campaign for part of the 2016 election cycle and later serving as an adviser to the Trump 2024 team.\n\n“No one can really control Corey,” a senior official told Axios.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "It turns out trans student athletes aren’t the only ones who are having to contend with politicians keeping them from playing sports, now adult trans hockey players are facing challenges too.\n\nHarrison Browne, who starred in Heated Rivalry and was the first openly transgender pro hockey player, is speaking out against USA Hockey’s new eligibility policy, which doesn’t outright ban trans athletes, but makes it almost impossible for them to compete even in recreational leagues.\n\nBack in November, USA Hockey, the national governing body for hockey, which oversees the U.S. participation in the Olympics, quietly released a new Participant Eligibility Policy, but when Browne found out about it yesterday, he immediately took to Instagram to alert his followers to the updated anti-trans rules.\n\n“USA Hockey is basically telling me I can’t play in a recreational league with friends that I played my entire career with,” Browne told PRIDE. “I just think that’s crazy.\"\n\nThe new policy, which updates what previously was a much more inclusive version from 2019, will put strict rules on who can play in youth, junior, disabled, and adult hockey leagues when it goes into effect on April 1, 2026. According to the updated policy, trans athletes can still play in co-ed leagues, but they are restricted to their sex assigned at birth when it comes to sex-exclusive leagues.\n\n“In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy,” the policy reads.\n\nThis means that trans women would be forced to play in men’s leagues, and trans men would have to play in women’s leagues unless they take testosterone, in which case they wouldn’t be allowed in either space.\n\n“The safest spaces I’ve found are queer spaces, are women’s spaces,” Browne said, explaining that forcing trans women to play in men’s leagues wouldn’t be safe because they are still plagued by “homophobia and transphobic language, whether that’s on the ice or behind closed doors in the locker room.”\n\nWhile not an outright ban, this new policy will make it nearly impossible for trans hockey players to play in any league overseen by USA Hockey, which includes less competitive recreational leagues, often called “beer leagues” by players.\n\nWomen’s hockey leagues across the country are having to deal with the new policy, with some taking to social media to assure players that they are looking into what it will mean for them. The Seattle Women’s Hockey Club wrote on Instagram, “To our trans members: it is the board's firm belief that our community is better for having you in it. Hockey belongs to anyone who has ever picked up a stick or cheered on their team, and that includes you, regardless of what USA Hockey says.”\n\nBrowne places the blame for this shift from a fairly inclusive trans participation policy to one that, in practice, will likely keep many trans athletes from playing hockey squarely on President Donald Trump’s shoulders. “We can’t overlook the fact that the [Trump] Administration is putting a lot of pressure on sports organizations to make a stance against trans participation in sports,” he said.\n\nRepublicans frequently claim that their focus on trans women in sports is because they care about fairness, but the argument is specious and ignores the larger issues in the sport, Browne said.\n\n“Transgender women, transgender people are not the issue here,” he said. “It is socioeconomic status, it’s access. If you have access to better coaching, if you have access to better facilities, better equipment, better nutrition, you are automatically going to be a better athlete. What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 'Heated Rivalry's Harrison Browne says new anti-trans hockey policy is 'crazy' and blames Trump\n\nSo you finished 'Heated Rivalry': Here are 2 ways to get into hockey\n\n7 gayest moments from the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 (so far)\n\n5 times athletes lived out the plot of 'Heated Rivalry' in real life",

At the time, the mRNA specialist announced the discontinuation of four clinical mRNA programs and outlined a three-year business strategy with the goal of boosting revenue by 10% in 2026.\n\n“Over the next three years, we expect to build a large seasonal vaccine franchise for at-risk populations and invest the cash generated into oncology and rare disease therapeutics,” Bancel said at the time.\n\nThe November release also outlines Europe as “a significant market for respiratory virus vaccines.”\n\nThe Moderna spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for its current phase 2 infectious disease programs.\n\nBancel’s comments come days after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., rebuked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing the lawyer’s stance on vaccines as “anti-science.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Moderna and Pfizer raced to develop and deliver COVID-19 vaccines—Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively—to abate the worldwide pandemic. Their efforts and success prompted major revenue and investment not only into their companies but into the biopharma industry itself.\n\nBut over the last year, U.S. mistrust in vaccines has continued to accelerate, as long-time vaccine conspiracist RFK. Jr. divests and dismantles federal infrastructure for the science. Just this month, the CDC overhauled the longstanding U.S. childhood vaccine schedule, removing broad vaccination recommendations for COVID, flu, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\nFor Bancel, the falling-out means Moderna is turning its focus toward cancer. Earlier this week, the company shared five-year data for its Merck & Co.-partnered cancer vaccine, which, when combined with Keytruda, cut the risk of cancer recurrence or death by 49% in comparison to Keytruda alone.\n\nThe move isn’t shocking, as Moderna’s Kyle Holen, M.D., head of development, therapeutics and oncology, told Fierce in October that most of the company's upcoming investigational new drug applications will be in the oncology space. Holen cited the political climate for developing infectious disease vaccines and “a huge unmet need in cancer” as reasons behind the decision.\n\nThough Moderna is moving away from vaccines for infectious diseases, Bancel has expressed disappointment about the action.\n\n“It is sad for us to see that. Vaccines that have been proven for decades helping people around the world are not recommended anymore,” he told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“If you look at all healthcare interventions, getting a vaccine is one of the highest return investments in the same year—not 10 or 20 years out—to prevent cardiac attack,” the leader said about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, noting that the inoculations also prevent hospitalizations related to severe illness.\n\n“We tend to forget that hospitalization is a big deal,” Bancel continued. “If you are 67 years old, you get hospitalized—in a week, you can lose 10% of your muscle mass. Ten percent muscle mass doesn't seem a lot like this, but it might mean the difference between you being able to live a high-quality life and your life becoming living from your bed to your sofa. So that’s the message about vaccines.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "The correspondent recounted asking a question to the president in September related to the First Amendment.",
    "fullText": "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl recalled a specific encounter with President Donald Trump when asked if the president has ever made him “fear” for his safety.\n\nDuring an interview with comedian Hasan Minhaj released Wednesday, Karl pointed to an exchange with Trump in September. While standing with other reporters on the South Lawn, Karl asked the president about comments made by Attorney General Pam Bondi in the wake of the assassination of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s going to go after hate speech? Is that, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl said, according to a video of the interaction.\n\nTrump replied: “She’d probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”\n\n“Would that be appropriate?” Karl could be heard responding in the background, as Trump went on to say, “Maybe they will come after ABC. ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they’ll have to go after you.”\n\nIn his comments, the president appeared to reference how ABC News agreed in December 2024 to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over statements about Trump made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nKarl said he asked the president a “very simple question” and called his initial answer a “shocking moment.”\n\n“So the idea that the president of the United States is suggesting that the power of the Department of Justice could be brought to bear against journalists, who the president of the United States doesn’t believe are fair — that’s a very interesting reading of the First Amendment,\" Karl said.\n\nDuring the interview with Minhaj, Karl also discussed how a theme of Trump’s reelection campaign was vowing to “go after” his perceived political enemies. He pointed to his pardons of Jan. 6 rioters on the first day of his second term, as well as the “hollowing out” of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n“There’s nobody like at the White House now telling Donald Trump, ‘Look, sir, we really shouldn’t do this,’” Karl said. “I mean, people advise him, but it’s like he’s got the people around him who are going to carry out the orders.”",

    "description": "It's like the last few days never happened.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 closed up 0.55% yesterday on good news about U.S. GDP growth and President Trump retracting his threat to impose more tariffs on Europe if he isn’t given Greenland. After a selloff earlier this week, the S&P is again above 6,900 and within 1% of its all-time high. Gold hit another record yesterday, too.\n\nBut futures on the index were down 0.24% prior to the opening bell in New York and markets in Europe sold off slightly this morning after Asia closed mixed, a sign that traders are booking profits after yesterday’s rally. \n\nOn the macro front, Wall Street analysts are bullish. It’s a marked change from the fraught mood of the last few days.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s tariffs are turning out to be a much smaller economic deal than “earlier worst-case fears,” JPMorgan Chase says. Companies have adjusted their pricing and supply chains, and the result is “the realized tariff rate has been much lower at ~11% (versus expectations of 15%,”), according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team. “Only 14% of S&P 500 companies are highly sensitive to tariffs.”\n\nAnd it could get better if the U.S. Supreme Court decides the president lacks the power to unilaterally enact tariffs, the bank says.\n\n“Prediction markets assign >65% odds that the Supreme Court rules against the government, and those odds have consistently been against the government, especially following the November Supreme Court oral arguments,” Lakos-Bujas told clients.\n\nAnalysts were also cheered by a new upward revision for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of last year, at 4.4%.\n\n“The 4.4% real growth rate is much higher than normal and is likely to moderate over the course of the year, but if we can stay above 3% for the entire year it could lead to double-digit returns in the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management said in an email seen by Fortune.\n\nEY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco was singing from the same hymnbook. “Momentum was driven by resilient consumer spending, robust equipment and AI-related investment, a sizeable boost from net international trade, and a rebound in federal government outlays. The U.S. economy is neither overheating nor stalling—it is adjusting,” he said in a note.\n\nAll of that explains the calm we’re seeing in the markets today.\n\n“For some assets, it was almost like the selloff never happened, with the VIX index of volatility (-1.26pts) back at 15.64pts, which is beneath its levels prior to Saturday’s tariff announcements,” according to Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank.",

    "description": "He did not hold back against the media.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino harshly tore into the media during his first televised interview since departing President Donald Trump’s administration, describing outlets as having “a full diaper all the time.”\n\nBongino, a former Secret Service agent, officially returned to private life earlier this month after serving in his role in the FBI for less than a year. Since his departure, he announced he will return to hosting his self-titled podcast show in early February while becoming increasingly candid on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News late Thursday, Bongino accused the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nEarlier in the day, Axios reported — citing data from the Council on Criminal Justice — that the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900. However, the outlet noted that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade law during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office, indicating it raises questions about whether Trump’s policies have had an impact on the decline.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” Bongino told host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these dumba----.”\n\nHe then pointed to a story from The New York Times, which released interviews with 45 current and former employees who accused the FBI under its director, Kash Patel, of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?”\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge,“ he continued. ”Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country.\"\n\nBongino went on to say that the media is a “big full diaper,” adding he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity declared that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” noting that he was more restrained while working for the FBI.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”",

    "description": "At Davos, the California governor criticized Trump, was blocked from the US pavilion, traded insults, waved kneepads, and fueled 2028 speculation.",
    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

    "fullText": "Is prison like the movies? The pardoned billionaire founder of Binance thinks so.\n\nChangpeng \"CZ\" Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering rules in 2023. He served four months in prison in 2024 and was pardoned by President Donald Trump in October 2025.\n\nSince then, Zhao has been \"pretty busy,\" he said in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. He's working on a free education platform, an investment platform, and advises a dozen governments on crypto regulation, he said.\n\nEveryone wants to talk to Zhao about his prison experience, though, unless they're too afraid to ask. \"It's definitely a conversation starter,\" he said.\n\n\"My first roommate is a double murderer,\" Zhao said. \"He's been there for like twelve years, he still has 18 years to go, and then he got moved to a low-security prison.\"\n\nHe was a \"nice guy,\" Zhao added.\n\nZhao was surprised by his prison sentence, he said. He expected to be given home confinement.\n\nThe first day was \"pretty brutal,\" Zhao said. He described his strip search in detail, including prison staff searching his mouth and tongue as well as his genitalia.\n\nZhao's pardon has drawn scrutiny, with some onlookers questioning Trump's motives. Binance has promoted USD1, the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto asset manager backed by the Trump family.\n\n\"The American people deserve transparency regarding whether the pardon power was exercised impartially or influenced by personal financial interests,\" Rep. Robert Garcia wrote in a November letter.\n\nTrump also denied knowing who Zhao is in a \"60 Minutes\" interview following the pardon.\n\nIn his CNBC interview, Zhao also appeared to position himself as removed from the process. Of the pardon procedure, he said, \"I still don't know what the process is.\"\n\nZhao said his motivation for applying for a pardon came from media coverage speculating that he could receive one. After he applied, the administration was a \"black box.\"\n\n\"What people suggested the most is: get in front of Trump yourself,\" Zhao said. \"But I never got in front of Trump. I just waited and waited and waited, and suddenly it happened.\"\n\nHas he spoken to Trump? \"No, not yet,\" Zhao said.\n\nThe closest he's gotten, he said, was Trump's \"Board of Peace\" signing in Davos. Zhao was in the audience, some 30 to 40 feet away from the president who pardoned him.\n\n\"Never talked to him,\" he said. \"Never shook hands.\"",

    "description": "Jake Tapper shamed Karoline Leavitt after the White House press secretary lied about President Donald Trump confusing Greenland for Iceland.",
    "fullText": "Jake Tapper shamed Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday after the White House press secretary lied about President Donald Trump confusing Greenland for Iceland in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\nPosting a video to his personal X account, the CNN host mocked Leavitt for arguing that the president wasn’t “mixing anything up.”\n\n“I mean, you know that that was filmed, right?” Tapper asked incredulously.\n\nWatch the video of Tapper’s breakdown — which includes the clips in question — below:\n\n“Earlier today, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump, at least three times referred to Greenland, a territory he wants to seize or purchase from Denmark, three times referred to Greenland as Iceland,” Tapper said before introducing Leavitt’s defense.\n\n“When a reporter went on X and pointed this out, the White House press secretary, whose salary your tax dollars pay for, wrote, ‘No he didn’t Libby, his written remarks referred to Greenland as a piece of ice because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here. OK?'”\n\nA claim to which Tapper replied: “Let’s roll the tape.”\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Wednesday, there were unmistakably several instances where Trump said “Iceland” when he meant to say “Greenland.” “When I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy,” he said in one moment; “Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money,” he said in another.\n\n“This all reminds me of this great, horrifying quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel ‘1984,’” Tapper pondered on his social video.\n\n“‘The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,'” the host quoted. “But we don’t live in 1984 and we don’t have to reject the evidence of our eyes and ears. We know that he confused Iceland with Greenland or Greenland with Iceland. And I mean, you can lie to us if you want, but I don’t know why it’s worth it.”\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Shames Karoline Leavitt for Lying About Trump’s Greenland-Iceland Mix-Up: ‘Let’s Roll the Tape’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

    "title": "From potential Treasury Secretary to a $5 billion lawsuit: Trump and Jamie Dimon's on-again, off-again relationship",
    "description": "The relationship between President Donald Trump and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has oscillated between public barbs and admissions of respect.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon is known for saying what he thinks. At Davos, the JPMorgan CEO was uncharacteristically constrained when talking about Donald Trump and his policies, striking a cautious balance between criticism and praise. \n\nThis is a familiar dance in a relationship that has swung between mutual respect and open hostility since Trump first took office in 2016.\n\nDimon, who once described himself as \"barely a Democrat,\" has publicly criticized some of Trump's economic and political policies, including on tariffs, while also praising his deregulatory moves and efforts to grow the economy.\n\n\"He was kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said in Davos in 2024, while in the same breath saying he didn't like some of Trump's rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump has filed suit against Dimon and JPMorgan for $5 billion over claims of politically-motivated debanking, here's a look at their relationship over the years.\n\nAlthough he financially supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for office, Dimon didn't publicly endorse a candidate that year, in 2012, or in 2016. He said in a memo following Trump's victory that his win reflected a \"deep desire for change\" across the country.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO sat on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that first met in February of 2017 and focused on how government policies affected economic growth. After Trump's inflammatory response to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the council, including Dimon, decided to disband the group.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump announced that he was disbanding the group in a post on then-Twitter.\n\nTrump said in the recent lawsuit that JPMorgan told him in February 2021 that it was closing his accounts, along with accounts of some of his family's businesses. Trump, along with some other conservatives, has criticized perceived politically motivated \"debanking\" in recent months, claiming that JPMorgan and other banks have shut down the accounts of conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican primaries, Dimon openly praised former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and advised Democrats to support her if they didn't want to face Trump again.\n\n\"Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, help Nikki Haley, too,\" he said at the DealBook Summit. \"Get a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\"\n\nDimon also said he was ready to work with Trump again, should he win reelection.\n\nThe banker's call for supporting Haley drew Trump's ire, with the then-former president calling Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's tone on Dimon changed during a 2024 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he said he had \"a lot of respect\" for the JPMorgan CEO.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" he added when asked if Dimon could be his next Treasury Secretary.\n\nTrump ramped up pressure on Dimon in the lead-up to the 2024 election, posting on Truth Social that Dimon had endorsed him.\n\nDimon denied he'd endorsed Trump through a JPMorgan spokesperson.\n\nThe pair's public relationship grew tense again in the summer of 2025, after Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.\n\nTrump told CNBC that JPMorgan and Bank of America had refused to accept his deposits, saying that the financial institutions \"discriminate against many conservatives.\"\n\nTrump's claims of discrimination gave way to his $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and its CEO. The bank denies any wrongdoing related to the closure of Trump's accounts, saying that account closures are sometimes required \"because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\"\n\n\"We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" reads a January statement from JPMorgan.\n\nHowever, the suit isn't the only recent point of tension between Trump and Dimon. Dimon has become more outspoken in his opposition to some of Trump's latest economic policies, including lambasting Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest as an \"economic disaster.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans.\n\nIn a January interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Dimon also reiterated his belief in the Fed's independence, which has come into question in recent days amid the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\nDimon said there was \"absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason\" that he would serve as Fed Chair, but he did say he would \"consider\" the job of Treasury Secretary — if it was offered.\n\nHe'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision, Dimon said.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "description": "The Danish shop owner whose MAGA parody hat went viral says he's glad Trump backed down on Greenland for now, but still doesn't trust the President.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's ambition to take over Greenland may be on ice for now, but supporters of the Danish territory won't soon forget the affair.\n\nIn particular, Jesper Tønnesen, the Copenhagen shop owner whose MAGA parody hat went viral, told Business Insider he'll continue to raise support for Greenland's right to self-determination.\n\n\"You don't feel that you have any promises, because it can change again,\" he said of Trump's proposed deal with Denmark.\n\nTønnesen's business was thrust into the international spotlight over a red MAGA-style hat he designed late last year in protest of a US takeover of Greenland that read \"Nu det Nuuk,\" a twist on the Danish way of saying \"Now it's enough\" that used the name of Greenland's capital city.\n\nTønnesen said he was inspired by a parody \"Make America Go Away\" hat he had seen earlier, but he felt it was important to make a statement in his native language. The alternate MAGA phrase was also included on a side panel with a Greenland flag.\n\n\"Trump maybe took one step too much,\" he said of the threats to seize the NATO ally's territory. \"We can't communicate with him — we have to say, now it's enough, because we tried.\"\n\nAn initial run of 300 hats didn't get much traction at first, but search interest and copycat products surged last weekend after Trump ramped up his rhetoric over the issue and protesters in Copenhagen and Nuuk took to the streets.\n\nAhead of the protests, Tønnesen and his team made a printed version of the hats to distribute to the crowd, turning the image into an overnight sensation.\n\nE-commerce tracking service JungleScout told Business Insider it has tracked a nearly 900% increase in search volume for the term \"Greenland\" over the past 30 days.\n\nTønnesen said he and his partners are keeping none of the profits from the hats, pledging to donate the money to Greenlandic charities.\n\n\"I have five minutes of fame where I can use this to help Greenland,\" he said. \"That's what it's all about.\"\n\nTrump said this week he has no intention of taking the territory by force and no longer intends to slap tariffs on European countries over the Greenland issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump also said an agreement would include \"total access\" for the US.\n\nTønnesen said he has several thousand more hats arriving in the next few days, including a design that says Greenland is \"Already Great.\"\n\nStill, he is aware that the window of public attention can be short.\n\n\"I had the possibility to speak out,\" he said. \"You have to do it when the train is running.\"",

    "fullText": "Jan 22 (Reuters) - General Motors is moving production of a China-built Buick SUV to the U.S., ​its latest move to expand U.S. factory work in the ‌wake of the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said Thursday it is ending China production ‌of the Buick Envision, a midsize SUV that it has been importing to the U.S. for nearly a decade. GM will instead build the next generation of the vehicle at its assembly plant in the Kansas City area ⁠starting in 2028.\n\n“This decision further ‌strengthens GM’s domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs,” the automaker said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nGM has shipped ‍the Envision to the U.S. since 2017 as its only Chinese import. GM has faced a 25% tariff on the vehicles since 2018, and did not win ​an exemption from the tariff during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe Envision ‌became a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.\n\nTariffs on vehicles imported from China increased last year amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nLast year, GM announced it would ⁠bring production of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV ​to the same Kansas City-area plant, from ​a factory in Mexico. GM recently began production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt out of the plant for a limited run.\n\nWhen ‍production of the ⁠Bolt ends, GM will convert the plant to make only combustion-engine vehicles. Equinox production will start in 2027, GM said.\n\nGM is also ⁠moving production of the Chevy Blazer to Spring Hill, Tennessee, from Mexico in 2027.",

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court Shows It’s Willing to Thwart Trump—When Money Is on the...",
    "fullText": "The court’s conservatives appear likely to block trump from firing Lisa Cook—not because they care about principle but because they care about the Fed.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a case that centers on Donald Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board commissioner Lisa Cook. The legal arguments should be familiar to anyone who has been watching Trump’s authoritarian takeover of the federal government: Trump claims he has the authority to fire anybody he wants; Cook argues “that’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works.”\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has generally been game to allow Trump to fire whomever he wants. The court says Trump is entitled to this power under the “Unitary Executive Theory,” a fringe theory that was made up by Republican academics to justify dismantling the regulatory state and that has been adopted by Supreme Court Republicans over the past few years. The theory reimagines every independent agency created by Congress as part of Trump’s personal fiefdom. Based on this view, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board (see Trump v. Wilcox); and it will likely allow him to fire commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (see Trump v. Slaughter. If the theory holds, Trump should be able to fire Cook.\n\nBut here’s the benefit of using a made-up thing like Unitary Executive Theory: The Republicans on the court can make it do whatever they want it to do. While Trump has been busy waving his magic wand and shouting “unitarium executatus!” at the Fed, he’s failed to grasp that the Supreme Court is the author of the entire book of spells. The court can make the spell fizzle out whenever it wants.\n\nUnlike the NLRB and the FTC, Republicans on the court like the Fed. They like its independence. They like what it does. Since Unitary Executive Theory did not exist as a practical thing until Trump decided to take away the independence of all the executive agencies Republicans don’t like, it’s very easy for the Republican justices to say that Unitary Executive Theory doesn’t exist when it comes to the one independent agency they actually care about.\n\nIndeed, Chief Justice John Roberts laid the groundwork for granting the Fed a made-up cloak of protection during the Trump v. Wilcox arguments, which took place after Trump made his first noises about firing Cook. Anticipating her likely firing, Roberts noted that the Fed was a “uniquely structured, quasi-private” independent agency, distinct from all the others. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh has made similar statements. This means at least two Republican justices are already poised to allow Trump to run roughshod over every independent agency except the Fed.\n\nWhy? Well, the easy answer is that the Fed has a direct impact on the financial health of the Republicans on the Supreme Court and the donors who’ve bought them. The stability of monetary policy, and its independence from the crazy white supremacist installed in the White House, is important for the stock market, and thus all of the investments rich people have.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that destabilizing the Fed could, without hyperbole, crash the economy. Even beyond the matter of their personal finances, it’s likely that the Republican justices care about that. Remember, before the Roberts court was known as the most pro-authoritarian court in US history, it was widely regarded as the most pro-business court in US history.\n\nPractically speaking, giving Trump personal control over the Fed is bad for business. While the Republicans famously do not care about practicality when it comes to abortion rights or gun rights, when it comes to money? The Republicans care a great deal.\n\nThe majority of the justices’ evident skepticism toward Trump in this case are only really intelligible if you understand both the personal and national implications of the issue in front of the court. The core argument made by the Trump administration was that Cook was fired “for cause,” as is required by statute. The administration claims that the “cause” is an allegation that Cook committed mortgage fraud (she did not) before she was appointed to the Fed. Ostensibly, the justices were arguing over whether this particular alleged fraud is enough of a cause (because not only are the allegations false; they’re allegations over conduct from before she was on the Fed, which is not normally a “for cause” reason to fire somebody from a federal position). The justices were also arguing over whether Cook should have any opportunity to defend herself from these (again, provably false) allegations.\n\nAgain, Trump has fired people based on made-up allegations before. The only reason the court is skeptical about this firing, based on these made-up allegations, is that the ability to fire Fed commissioners at will places the monetary policy of the entire nation at the whim of Trump. We are literally watching Trump trying to push Fed chair Jerome Powell out right now, but he won’t have to push him if the court says the president can just fire Fed officials whenever he wants.\n\nBecause of this, Kavanaugh finally raised the question that he should have raised during every Trump-fires-someone case the court has heard thus far. He asked Solicitor General John Sauer what would stop future presidents from “manufacturing” artificial “cause” to justify firing Fed commissioners whose political positions they don’t like. Sauer said that Trump’s reasons were not manufactured, and that the “for cause” provision protects commissioners from being fired for policy reasons. But everyone knows that the only reason Cook was fired by Trump was policy reasons. Kavanaugh rightly intuited that if Trump can fire Cook, a future Democratic president can just come in and fire all the Trump appointees and install Fed commissioners loyal to the new administration’s monetary policies. Kavanaugh literally quoted himself—from his confirmation hearing, when he threatened retribution on his political enemies—and warned: “What goes around comes around.”\n\nThat’s always been true with these firing cases. Kavanaugh just suddenly cares about it now.\n\nNor is it just Kavanaugh who has suddenly decided to care about the obvious. Here’s what will really shock people who naively think the Republicans on the Supreme Court are committed to their own logic: I think Justice Sam Alito is in play for ruling against Trump. For the first time during Trump’s second reign, he sounded like he was trying to find a way to rule against the president—specifically, to send the case back down to a lower court to have it decide whether the alleged pre-office mortgage fraud was sufficient “cause” for this firing. Roberts and Kavanaugh wanted to end this attack on the Fed now, but Alito (and Ketanji Brown Jackson, to an extent) seemed interested in letting a lower court simply say “this isn’t cause,” as opposed to forcing the Supreme Court to do the dirty work.\n\nThe two justices most aligned with Trump’s position were Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, and that should not be surprising. Say what you will about those two (and I’ve said a lot about how much they suck), those guys are consistent in their belief that the practical consequences of their decisions should be ignored, even when their decisions lead to suffering and death. Thomas and Gorsuch are, like the rest of the justices from both parties, outcome determinative. But in this case, the outcome these two value most is power, not the health of the American economy. If Trump wants to use that power to crash the economy, that’s his problem, not Thomas’s or Gorsuch’s (according to them).\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin R. Barber\n\nStill, they were in the minority. Ultimately, Roberts does not want Trump to have personal control over the Fed, so Trump won’t have it. I also don’t think Roberts wants Trump to be able to impose retaliatory tariffs, so Trump likely won’t have that power either. Roberts does want Trump to be able to kill the NLRB and USAID, so he can. I don’t yet know if Roberts wants Trump to be able to end birthright citizenship, but I guess I’ll find out soon.\n\nI wish Roberts thought immigrants and white ladies in Minnesota were as important as the Federal Reserve. I wish Roberts thought protecting American schoolchildren was as important as protecting American investments. I wish Roberts thought discriminating against a Black woman working at Publix was as important as discriminating against a Black woman working for the Fed. But… he doesn’t.\n\nTrump will lose this case because he’s trying to mess with something the Supreme Court thinks is important. I wish we all could be so lucky as to appear valuable to John Roberts and the Supreme Court.",

    "description": "See how William McKinley's tariff policies that have inspired President Trump's affected everyday Americans in the 1890s.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have become a defining feature of his second term, central to his strategy for reshaping global trade.\n\nAggressive tariff policies have been rare at the White House in recent decades, but history offers clues about how they can ripple through everyday American life.\n\nThe last time sweeping tariffs were enacted, in the 1890s, it was at the hand of William McKinley, who authored the highly protectionist Tariff Act of 1890, imposing tariffs of more than 50% on many imported goods.\n\nMcKinley, who was the US president from 1897 to 1901, introduced his tariff policies while serving as a congressman. They had far-reaching effects on the economy and were ultimately unpopular among voters, leading him and other Republican congressmen to lose their seats in the 1890 midterms. Even McKinley himself changed his mind on foreign trade by the time he became president.\n\n\"This was protectionist at its height,\" William K. Bolt, a professor of history at Francis Marion University in South Carolina, told Business Insider of McKinley's original policy. \"And there was a significant political backlash against it.\"\n\nTrump has credited McKinley's tariff policies for making America a \"very wealthy country,\" and repeatedly namedropped him on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\n\"In the 1890s, our country was probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs,\" Trump said in a Michigan town hall in September. \"We had a president, you know McKinley?\"\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has pushed an expansive and often unpredictable tariff agenda, from his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs to country-specific threats that have rattled markets and trade partners.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's desire for the US to buy Greenland has reignited concerns over a potential trade war between the US and its European allies, as Trump threatened eight European nations with a new 10% tariff starting February 1. He has since paused those plans.\n\nOn the other side of the wealth divide, workers and immigrants faced harsh living conditions.\n\nThe rapid increase in industrialization drew masses to America, and immigration, particularly from countries in eastern and southern Europe, changed the face of the workforce, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nChildren, who weren't protected by law from physically challenging labor, had often started contributing to their households by age 10.\n\nIn New York City, the population doubled every decade from 1800 to 1880. Tenement housing, where families packed as many people as possible into apartments by using cheap materials to create walls or add floors to existing buildings, quickly dominated parts of the city. These settlements often lacked indoor plumbing or ventilation, leading to a rapid increase in the spread of illnesses. The cramped conditions also led to many fires in major cities.\n\nJacob Riis' \"How The Other Half Lives,\" a photojournalism book documenting the lives of poor Americans towards the end of the century, exposed the realities faced by millions of people, such as having 12 adults sleeping in 13-feet-wide rooms and child mortality in tenements being as high as one in 10.\n\nAn average family spent nearly 60% of their annual income on food and rent, and laborers — including children — often worked six 10-hour days per week.\n\nOne report of living standards of the time suggested that an average family's dreams would be fulfilled by owning a home valued around $36,000 in today's money, a Sunday dress and suit, a barrel of flour, 5 tons of coal, and $9,000 in today's money in savings.\n\nThe presence of disposable income led to the establishment of department stores and consumerism in the big cities.\n\nFor women entering the workforce, retail stores offered a more respectable field of work than the factory work available to them, which was mostly in textile and garment manufacturing. While job opportunities opened for women, their wages remained significantly lower than men's, who were still seen as the breadwinners of the households, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the federal income tax in 1913, tariffs were the federal government's main source of funding.\n\nIn an effort to help the economy recover following the Civil War, the government had kept tariffs on foreign goods relatively high compared to pre-war rates, Douglas Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote for the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nHowever, by the late 1880s, a unique problem had arisen: The federal government was taking in too much money from tariffs, resulting in a budget surplus over 40% higher than its spending.\n\nBoth parties agreed to revisit tariff rates in efforts to reduce it, although each side supported a different alternative in what became known as the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.\n\nBorn in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, William McKinley was working as a school teacher when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He enlisted in the Union Army and quickly climbed the ranks. After the war, he attended Albany Law School in New York and began his political career shortly after, being elected to the House of Representatives in 1876.\n\nAuthored by McKinley and later named after him, the Tariff Act of 1890 raised protective tariffs of over 1,500 products by almost 50%.\n\nThe tariff imposed duties on items like tinplate and wool while eliminating tariffs on sugar, molasses, tea, and coffee. The goal of the act was to \"make the duty on foreign-tinplate high enough to insure its manufacture in this country,\" McKinley said in 1890.\n\nIt also protected American workers' wages from competition from cheaper labor abroad.\n\nWhile miners and farmers of crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes benefited from the stimulus to American production and the rise in foreign competitors' prices, some manufacturing was hurt by the price hikes in raw materials.\n\nThe tariffs affected consumer products like shoes, clothes, and canned goods, as well as some other 1,500 products, ranging from chemicals and metals to dairy products and grains, to varying degrees.\n\nUltimately, it was everyday people who ended up paying the price for the tariffs, Bolt said.\n\n\"Consumers had to pay a higher price for the manufactured good they wanted,\" Bolt said. \"So there was in fact a political backlash against the McKinley tariff.\"\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Tariff Act, McKinley's Republican Party lost control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1890, and the Ohio representative himself was ousted as the party lost 93 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOver the next two years, as voters continued to feel the impacts of the measure and other economic instabilities, the party also lost the presidential election and both chambers of Congress in 1892.\n\nAcross the country, economic unrest as prices rose turned workers against vendors and employers, leading to a rise in the labor movement.\n\nAs industries expanded, workers began to unite against industry barons to demand fair work conditions.\n\nAn 1892 strike demanding improvements in working conditions turned deadly after Carnegie Steel-hired security forces exchanged gunfire with the worker coalition.\n\nAcross the country, labor movements gained momentum, with the rising hostility between industry leaders and workers ending in fatal incidents.\n\nIn 1894, the Pullman Strike, after which Labor Day was established, led to dozens of deaths and millions of dollars in damages, pushing then-President Grover Cleveland to legitimize the labor movement by declaring the national holiday.\n\nThe rise in unemployment (which reached 17% by the winter and surpassed 10% for the next half of the decade), along with government spending on Civil War pensions, were some of the factors that contributed to the panic.\n\nFollowing the panic, the Democrats reduced some of McKinley's tariffs with the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894. Tariffs on some items — including iron ore, lumber, and wool — were nixed entirely, angering US producers of those products.\n\nFollowing the economic troubles, voters blamed President Grover Cleveland and his Democratic party, which didn't regain power in any branch of government until 1910.\n\nShortly after ending his term as governor of Ohio, serving from 1892 to 1896, McKinley ran for president on a protectionist platform that aimed to benefit American industries while discouraging trade with foreign nations.\n\n\"Free trade gives to the foreign producer equal privileges with us,\" McKinley proclaimed in a 1892 speech. \"It destroys our factories or reduces our labor to the level of theirs.\"\n\nMcKinley's tariff plans heavily targeted the import of goods like tinplate, wool, yarn, steel, and sugar in an effort to encourage domestic manufacturing.\n\nWith domestic industries continuing to grow thanks to widespread industrialization and an increase in goods production, American manufacturers saw a need for exports to an international market.\n\nHowever, America's tariffs on foreign imports led other nations to increase their duties on American products, limiting the domestic industries' role in foreign trade and hurting the economy as a surplus of production failed to bring in more revenue for manufacturers.\n\nOnce in the White House, President McKinley's approach to tariffs turned to a reciprocal view that would help export American products and stimulate trade rather than penalize it.\n\nStaying true to his election promise of high tariffs, McKinley supported the Dingley Tariff Act, which raised previously lowered tariffs back to an average of 49% on imported goods, according to Lewis L. Gould, a professor of American history at the University of Texas. However, the act also granted the president the power to negotiate tariff reductions up to 20% or add products to a tariff \"free-list.\"\n\nUsing the tariffs as a negotiating tool with foreign markets, McKinley encouraged nations to lower their tariffs on American goods to allow for more exports.\n\nMajor donations from executives from firms like JP Morgan and Standard Oil ensured that the McKinley presidency remained friendly to business interests.\n\nMcKinley was also in office for part of the Great Merger wave of 1895-1904, in which companies consolidated into larger firms, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Between 1895 and 1904, the average number of firms disappearing to mergers each year was 301; in 1899 alone, as merger activity peaked, this number rose to 1,028, per the NBER.\n\nWhile the Sherman Antitrust Act — a federal law prohibiting businesses from engaging in unfair practices that restrain competition — was passed in 1890, it is understood that the McKinley administration failed to strictly enforce the law to prevent large firms from consolidating into even larger monopolies during this period.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, one out of every eight children was employed by 1870. By 1900, the rate had risen to one in every five, with almost two million kids aged 10 to 15 working full-time jobs.\n\nIn rural areas, young boys (some even younger than 14) often worked at coal mines, breaking up coal with their bare hands or performing farm labor. In cities, many earned an income through newspaper delivery. In towns, both boys and girls often worked at mills or factories.\n\nThe unregulated growth of large firms led to more workers getting involved with the labor movement. Between 1897 and 1904, union membership increased from less than 500,000 to over two million workers, according to the US Department of Labor.\n\nWorkers united to demand fair working conditions, like improved facilities and hours. At the time, the norm for a worker was to work over 10 hours a day in places like factories or mills that exposed them to dangerous chemicals and conditions.\n\nAs the labor movement gained support, tensions between workers and businesses grew more hostile. One 1897 encounter between coal miners and local authorities, which later became known as the Lattimer Massacre, resulted in the death of 19 strikers.\n\nSent to Havana Harbor during the Cuban War of Independence against the Spanish, the USS Maine and its accidental explosion set the stage for America's declaration of war with Spain.\n\nUnverified reports of a Spanish attack on the ship alarmed Americans and quickly built support for the war, which Americans saw as a just cause for Cuban freedom.\n\nOn the night after the explosion alone, the Army received over 100,000 volunteers.\n\nThe Spanish-American war was perhaps the most significant development of the McKinley administration, and might've contributed to the president's shift in tone regarding foreign trade towards the end of his presidency.\n\nThe Spanish-American war greatly expanded America's reach in the hemisphere and beyond.\n\nThe 16-week war and low casualties on the American front helped raise the national spirit following the economic and political instability of the past century.\n\nAmerica's victory in the Spanish-American War and the subsequent annexation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam ended America's isolationist approach of the 19th century in favor of a globalist view, which was then reflected in the domestic politics adopted by McKinley's leadership.\n\nVictory in the war effectively turned a page in American politics as the country was now emboldened by its newly found global power.\n\nIn a drastic change in views since his Congress days, McKinley openly discouraged the protectionist economy in favor of reciprocal tariffs, saying that \"a policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals.\"\n\nHis speech at the Pan-American Exposition signaled a shift in the Republican Party's views of trade following the war, and opened the door for an expansionist economy.\n\nWhile attending the event, the president was shot by Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American laborer and anarchist. He died from the wounds eight days later, on September 14, 1901.\n\nDespite the economic turmoil of the previous decade, McKinley was widely mourned by the country.\n\n\"It's a great \"what-if\" in American politics,\" Bolt said. \"If McKinley wasn't assassinated, [would] we [have started] to move towards free trade a lot earlier than we did?\"\n\nFollowing McKinley's death, his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, and subsequent Progressive politics brought upon changes that alleviated the social and economic tensions of the Gilded Age.\n\nPower shifted from the barons and reforms in labor, trust busting, tax policies, and civil rights changed the landscape of American life.\n\nWhile McKinley's presidency is often overshadowed by his successor's, he had a significant impact on setting the stage for a new age in the domestic economy, both through his protectionist tariffs and his undoing of them.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "title": "Student-loan forgiveness for public servants is at risk under Trump's plan to ax cheaper monthly payments, Democratic lawmakers say",
    "description": "Trump agreed to a settlement that would end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Lawmakers raised concerns about pushing borrowers off too soon.",
    "fullText": "Millions of student-loan borrowers could soon be forced off a key repayment plan — and debt relief is on the line.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine, led their colleagues in raising concerns regarding the Department of Education's proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, which was created by former President Joe Biden and intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. Litigation halted the plan in 2024, and President Donald Trump's administration recently announced a proposed settlement that would effectively eliminate the plan and require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan with higher payments.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for eliminating SAVE by 2028, and this settlement would accelerate that timeline. The lawmakers wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that borrowers are likely to face \"significant hurdles\" switching to a new plan, and those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years — are at heightened risk.\n\n\"Forcing these borrowers to transition out of SAVE with little guidance risks further lost time to debt relief and payment increases that could render continued public service untenable,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBorrowers have not received credit toward PSLF while on the SAVE forbearance. While resuming payments on a different income-driven repayment plan would count toward PSLF, the lawmakers wrote that transitioning millions of borrowers to a new plan in a short timeframe would be a significant administrative burden, and they requested that the Department of Education give borrowers at least six months to switch to a new plan before their next payment comes due.\n\nThe department wrote in its press release that SAVE borrowers \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement at the time that \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nA slew of changes is on the horizon for student-loan borrowers. While borrowers are still waiting for a court to approve the SAVE settlement, provisions of Trump's spending legislation — including new repayment plans and borrowing caps — are set to be rolled out beginning in July.\n\nThose changes come as over 5 million borrowers are in default on their student loans, following the Trump administration's resumption of collections in May 2025 after a five-year pause. The Education Department announced last week that it is temporarily pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers. Still, Democratic lawmakers said in their letter that SAVE borrowers are at risk of defaulting should they face challenges transitioning to a new plan.\n\n\"It is imperative the Department take every action possible to ensure the 7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE are provided with the information and resources necessary to avoid delinquency or default in order to avoid an even bigger default crisis,\" they wrote.",

    "fullText": "Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.\n\nCooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nThe board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.\n\nCooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.\n\nSome of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time.

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "description": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.",
    "fullText": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.\n\nTrump spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday after he spent weeks demanding that Denmark hand over Greenland. The president cited “national security” reasons even though a 1951 treaty allows the U.S. to expand its military presence on the island, where it already maintains a base.\n\nIn his address, Trump said he wants “right, title, and ownership” of the territory. Afterward, the president announced he and European leaders had arrived at a “framework” and a “concept of a deal” regarding Greenland. He gave no specifics, but conservative commentators hailed the mystery agreement as the stuff of a modern-day Metternich.\n\nOn Wednesday’s AC360, Haberman said signs indicate that the deal in question is “something that is already in existence.”\n\n“So, Maggie, is it clear to you what, if anything, President Trump is getting from Denmark in Greenland that the U.S. doesn’t already have de facto control over?” Anderson Cooper asked.\n\n“No. And look, Anderson, we don’t know the answers to these questions,” Haberman replied. “There’s a lot left unsaid. The president didn’t answer this.”\n\nHaberman went on to say that based on what little information has been provided about the “framework,” it appears to be a reflection of the preexisting arrangement among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland.\n\n“As of now, based on what they’re talking about, it looks as if they’re talking about something that is already in existence,” she continued. “And in fact, the U.S. used to have a greater military presence in Greenland. It got scaled back after the Cold War.”\n\nShe noted that in his Davos speech, Trump maligned NATO and questioned if it would ever come to the defense of the U.S. In fact, the only time NATO’s collective defense provision was invoked was on behalf of the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] was invoked once, and it was after 9/11,” Haberman said. “And someone who is from New York, it’s surprising that they don’t recall that. And so, he is speaking about this completely in transactional terms. And you can see that this is not over. I understand that [NATO Secretary-General] Mark Rutte is trying to calm things down, but European leaders are still very alarmed. And leaders in Denmark have been very alarmed for weeks and weeks now before this really became much more public.”\n\nThe post Maggie Haberman Says Trump’s Greenland ‘Deal’ Appears To Be ‘Something That Is Already in Existence’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump touted his affordability agenda at Davos. The numbers are a mixed bag.",
    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "fullText": "If President Donald Trump gets his way on credit cards, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicts chaos — but more on the streets of American towns than in the walls of his own bank.\n\n\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said when asked about President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest rates. \"And I'm not making that up because of our business, we would survive it, by the way. In the worst case, you would have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans. Dimon proposed that the government test the proposal by forcing all the banks in Vermont and Massachusetts to comply, \"and then see what happens,\" causing a ripple of laughter through the audience.\n\n\"The people crying most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said, adding that those hurt will include restaurants, retailers, travel companies, and municipalities, \"because people will miss their water payments.\"\n\nWhatever the president and Congress decide, JPMorgan will \"deal with it,\" Dimon said. He promised that the bank would provide more extensive analysis of the potential effects, and said that he, too, wants greater affordability.\n\nDimon struck a largely conciliatory tone when asked about some of Trump's geopolitical moves — immigration and NATO, for example — which he called \"more qualitative, how it's going to work, what are the pieces, what's their intent.\" But he said he understands the card issue deeply and has a responsibility, of sorts, to speak up.\n\nDimon, like many other big-bank CEOs and business leaders, has previously said that reducing card interest rates could harm customers with lower credit scores. JPMorgan's CFO warned during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call last week that enacting price controls could \"make it no longer a good business.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider looked at Census Bureau data to see the top US imports from Germany, Denmark, and the other countries that could face new tariffs.",
    "fullText": "A trade war between the US and Europe is heating up as President Donald Trump demands American control over Greenland.\n\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, and France are four of the eight European countries that could face new tariffs once February kicks off. Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump briefly addressed high housing costs and interest rates in his Davos speech but did not get into specifics.",
    "fullText": "After making his case to acquire Greenland, President Donald Trump celebrated his own achievements and elaborated on his plans to address the high cost of housing in the US during his hourlong speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Homeownership has always been a symbol of health and vigor of American society, but that goal fell out of reach for millions and millions of people in the Biden era because interest rates went up so high,\" Trump said. \"Today, I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's proposals have included banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes, purchasing $200 billion of mortgage debt to reduce mortgage interest rates, introducing 50-year mortgages and portable home loans, and allowing homebuyers to use their 401(k)s to make a down payment.\n\n\"In 2024, the US built less than two million new homes,\" Trump said, adding that Biden admitted eight million new migrants. \"Those days are over.\"\n\nBut industry watchers and housing policy researchers say the fundamental driver of high housing costs is a shortage of homes — and there isn't a quick fix. Building enough housing to accommodate demand in markets across the US will take many years and require significant action on the state and local levels.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday cracking down on major investors in homes and asked Congress to pass legislation banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying houses.\n\n\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations, and America will not become a nation of renters,\" Trump said in Davos.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nBut these mega landlords own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, they've slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. The evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, previously told Business Insider that the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nIn Truth Social posts earlier this month, Trump announced that he had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to drive down mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates have since fallen. But industry experts said the impact of the move would likely be somewhat short-term and overshadowed by the ongoing housing shortage and moves by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump didn't provide further details on a plan at Davos, which was teased last week, that would enable Americans to pull from their 401(k)s to make a down payment on a home.\n\nThe proposal was first announced by Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Fox Business last week. \"Suppose that you put 10% down on a home, and then you take 10% of the equity of the home and put it in as an asset in your 401(k). Then your 401(k) will grow over time,\" Hassett told the network.\n\nMona Mahajan, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones, said at the time that the plan may be a good step in the right direction if it gets people thinking about diversifying their asset classes and investing earlier in their careers and home ownership journeys.\n\nUnder current tax code rules, first-time homebuyers have to pay a 10% penalty on withdrawing money before the age of 59 ½ from a 401(k) for a home purchase, with the exception of hardship withdrawals or disability reasons. Over the past few years, Congress has allowed people subject to natural disasters and terminal illnesses to withdraw money from their 401(k)s without penalties.\n\nFor IRAs, they can draw up to $10,000 penalty-free but have to pay income tax.\n\nFinancial experts often discourage people from taking out 401(k) loans for reasons such as a home purchase, as doing so could lead to lost growth opportunities, though workers who do so pay themselves with interest.\n\nIt's unclear whether this plan could have legs in Congress, as it would likely require changes to the tax code.\n\nAnother set of ideas that Trump didn't expand on in Davos involves changes to mortgages themselves.\n\nIn November 2025, Trump and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, said the administration was exploring a 50-year mortgage option and ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages.\n\nThe idea of a half-century-old mortgage has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that while 50-year loans would mean lower monthly payments, they would entail much higher interest costs for homeowners over the life of the loan and a much longer road to building equity.\n\nPulte also said the administration was \"actively evaluating\" so-called portable mortgages. These loans would enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property.\n\nHousing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up by empowering repeat buyers to spend more.\n\n\"Financing is not the solution,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, previously told Business Insider. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products — it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\"",

    "description": "The CEO of TCW says the shift away from US debt could accelerate. Others have flagged the risk of bond vigilantes protesting Trump's latest moves.",
    "fullText": "The \"Sell America\" trade could get worse if global investors are further shaken by Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.\n\nKatie Koch, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and the CEO of the $200 billion asset manager TCW Group, said she thinks investors could be on the verge of \"quiet quitting\" the US bond market.\n\nThat's because many foreign investors feel they're overexposed to the US and are wary of some of the President's new policies — like Trump's threat to slap a 10% tariff on European nations if Greenland isn't up for sale within the next few weeks, she suggested, citing her conversations with other asset managers at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe shift away from the US could happen quietly, Koch said, as investors looking to unwind their positions won't \"scream it from the rooftops.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see some quiet quitting of the US bond market, and that I'm worried about,\" Koch said, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines at Davos Tuesday. \"I expect that investors will continue to look to diversify,\" she later added.\n\n\"Sell America\" has been a lingering concern for investors over the past year as markets have taken in Trump's ambitious tariff and geopolitical plans. The worry is that policy uncertainty and fears of higher inflation and rising deficits could cause more investors to dump US assets, a move that, in the bond market, could cause rates to rise as a higher yield is needed to entice investors.\n\nMarkets already saw a \"Sell USA\" day on Tuesday, Koch said, referring to the steep sell-off in US equities and government bonds as investors sought to reduce their exposure to the US. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term interest rates in the economy, jumped 5 basis points.\n\nBonds from countries like Japan, Europe, and various emerging markets now look more attractive for bond investors than US Treasurys, Koch added.\n\nOther market commentators have their eye on how the bond market could react to Trump's policy changes. Bond vigilantes — investors who protest what they see as negative developments in the market by selling Treasurys to drive up yields — threw a major tantrum about the president's Liberation Day tariffs last year, a move that ultimately prompted Trump to walk back many of his tariff threats.\n\nA bigger sell-off in Treasurys could be prompted if the \"sell America\" gains more traction, Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"The administration's goal is to have lower interest rates to aid US households and businesses, which is hard to achieve if bond vigilantes send rates on the long-end of the yield curve higher,\" Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research, wrote in a client note.",

    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

    "title": "Supreme Court justices expressed frustration with 'hurried' Trump administration handling of Lisa Cook case",
    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump looked a little worse for wear arriving in Switzerland for what promises to be a highly tense appearance at this year’s World Economic Forum.\n\nCameras at the airstrip Wednesday morning captured the visibly tired, 79-year-old president disembarking before very slowly descending the stairs onto the tarmac.\n\nHe then turned and spoke briefly with reporters, his words all but lost amid the hum of the jet’s engines before setting off toward a nearby helicopter for the final leg of his journey.\n\nFurther footage of him subsequently walking up a red carpet at Davos, posted to X by White House Communications Adviser Margo Martin, shows the president breathing heavily and struggling to tread in a straight line.\n\nTrump’s arrival at the summit had been delayed after Air Force One was forced to make an abrupt return to Washington, D.C. last night following an electrical issue on board.\n\nHis second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nIt also follows after he attended a college football game Monday night, which saw him get home well past 2 a.m., and after he held a 104-minute White House press briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe president’s appearance at the summit comes amid a brewing trade war with European allies over his threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory controlled by NATO ally Denmark, in what critics describe as an assault on the rules-based international order.\n\nIt is not, however, the first time Trump has embarked on government business with an apparent lack of beauty sleep.\n\nThe almost-octogenarian MAGA leader has repeatedly dozed off during high-profile meetings at the White House over the past several weeks.\n\nThose gaffes, coupled with growing memory lapses, verbal slips, confusion and bouts of aggression, have in turn fueled fears Trump may be suffering from the early stages of dementia.\n\nOver the past week, the president has also offered increasingly bizarre justifications for his frenzied push to seize control of Greenland. His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "title": "Calls to invoke 25th Amendment grow as Trump tries to acquire Greenland. How does it work, and has it been used before?",
    "description": "The president's unusual text message to Norway's prime minister has prompted growing calls from lawmakers for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.",
    "fullText": "A growing number of lawmakers are calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office after Trump told Norway’s prime minister that his position on purchasing Greenland is tied to not winning the Nobel Peace Prize and he no longer feels obligated to “think purely of Peace.”\n\nThe remarkable exchange happened on Jan. 18, when the Norwegian leader, Jonas Gahr Store, sent a text message to Trump on behalf of himself and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb. The European leaders sent the message in an attempt to “deescalate” the increased conflict over Greenland and the latest tariff threat against the U.S.’s European allies.\n\nIn less than half an hour, Trump responded, writing, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government, but rather the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The five members of the committee are appointed by the country’s parliament.\n\nTrump doubled down on his intentions to “purchase” Greenland, writing, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!” and signing it “President DJT.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts is one of several members of Congress to call for Trump’s removal from office using the 25th Amendment. “Invoke the 25th Amendment,” Markey posted on X, along with a picture of a news headline of Trump’s unusual text message with Store. Additional Democratic House members, such as Reps. Eric Swalwell, Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Yassamin Ansari, have also called for the removal of Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment.\n\nIt dates back to 1963, when Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. There was no plan in place to choose Johnson’s replacement, and there was concern about the procedure if he were to become ill or incapacitated before a new vice president could be named. In 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and it became part of the Constitution in February 1967.\n\nThe 25th Amendment has four sections. The first three clarify the presidential order of succession and who can temporarily assume the president’s duties. Section 4 gets the most attention: It’s a multi-step process for the vice president and the Cabinet to declare that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nInvoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment would require Vice President JD Vance and the majority of Trump’s Cabinet to submit a declaration to Congress that Trump isn’t able to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Doing so would mean an immediate transfer of presidential power to Vance, who would serve as acting president. Trump would have the chance to refute the declaration, which could then be challenged by his Cabinet. Congress would have 21 days from the date of receiving the declaration to formally approve any decision to remove Trump from office.\n\nA two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed in order for Trump to be removed from office. Otherwise, he would regain his presidential powers.\n\nThe first section of the 25th Amendment was invoked when Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974 and was replaced by his vice president, Gerald Ford. Section 2 was used when Gerald Ford, as president, nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, and he was confirmed in the House and the Senate.\n\nSection 3 was used in 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent brief cancer surgery and Vice President George H.W. Bush assumed his responsibilities. In 2002 and 2007, George W. Bush invoked Section 3 when he underwent medical procedures, and then-Vice President Dick Cheney became acting president.\n\nSection 4 has never been used because the process is so challenging. It’s more difficult to remove a president under the 25th Amendment using Section 4 than under the impeachment process.\n\nThe purpose of seeking impeachment to remove a president from office is to address potential “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nThe House would require a simple majority to vote on Articles of Impeachment, which are formal written charges against a president. After a trial, the Senate would vote on whether to convict and remove the president from office, which requires a two-thirds vote. The Senate can vote in a separate proceeding to ban the president from holding future office, which would require a simple majority vote.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. The first time was on Dec. 18, 2019, for initiating foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, and the second was on Jan. 13, 2021, following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate and remained in office.\n\nShould the movement grow to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump due to incapacity or inability to perform presidential duties, invoking it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The president would not be barred from holding future office.",
