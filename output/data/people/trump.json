    "description": "President Trump called on Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.",
    "fullText": "\"We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called on Republicans to \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" voting as he continued to make false claims about the electoral process in the U.S. with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.\n\nTrump made the comments in an interview with former FBI Director Dan Bongino, who resigned from his post in December and returned to podcasting.\n\nTrump alleged noncitizen voting was improperly influencing election outcomes, though experts insist such instances are incredibly rare and already illegal, and told Bongino it was \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it.\"\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over,'\" Trump said. \"We should take over the voting ... in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives states the authority to conduct federal elections, subject to laws passed by Congress. The elections clause states, in part, that \"state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate on how he wanted Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting.\n\nAsked by ABC News for specifics on what Trump meant, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded, \"President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections -- that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, slammed Trump over his comments to Bongino.\n\n\"Just a few hours ago, Donald Trump said he wants to nationalize elections around the country. That's what Trump said. You think he believes in democracy? He said, 'We want to take over, the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Does Donald Trump need a copy of the Constitution? What he is saying is outlandishly illegal.\"\n\nTrump's agenda is at stake in this year’s elections, where all seats in the House and 35 in the Senate will be up for grabs. Currently, Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers -- but midterm cycles are historically unkind to the sitting president's party.\n\nLast year, Trump and other Republicans pushed for mid-decade redistricting in order to gain additional House seats. The president warned Republicans last month that they have to win the midterms or he will get \"impeached.\"\n\nTrump also continues to litigate his 2020 election loss, spreading false claims of fraud.\n\nLast week, the FBI searched and seized original 2020 voting records from the Fulton County Elections and Operations Hub in Georgia, a swing state that went blue in 2020 and helped secure Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get, with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out,” Trump said on Bongino's podcast.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration’s latest bid to limit lawmakers from conducting unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities, ruling that it likely runs afoul of oversight measures that Congress implemented.\n\nIt’s the second time U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb has sided with the group of Democratic lawmakers suing.\n\nCobb ruled in December that the Trump administration was violating a rider attached to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) annual appropriations package, which guarantees lawmaker access to detention facilities.\n\nLast month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem re-implemented a notice requirement. It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "description": "The president insists that the performing arts center and JFK memorial is \"run down,\" \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his proposed plan to gut and renovate the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, telling White House reporters that he will “be using the steel” for the building’s existing structure and redo the rest.\n\n“Some of the marble comes down,” he said, adding, “It will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\nThe president came under fire Sunday after announcing plans to close the performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy for two years after controversially renaming it the Trump-Kennedy Center.\n\n“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday.\n\nMaintaining Monday that the center is “in very bad shape, it’s run down, it’s dilapidated, it’s sort of dangerous,” the president said the overhaul will cost “around $200 million” and spoke to his experience as a real estate mogul to back up the decision. (“In real estate and building, I’ve done so much of it, I’ve done so well with it.”)\n\nAsked by a reporter in the Oval Office if the renovation will tear down the arts center entirely, Trump said, “When it opens, it’s going to be brand new. Beautiful. I’m not ripping it down. I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure. We’re using some of the marble and some of the marble comes down. But when it’s open, it will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\n“So we’ll be closing it sometime around July 4. It’s, like, we’ll close it on July 4 in order to do something great for America. And then we’re building, we’ve got great contractors, we’re going to build it and we’ll do it right,” he said. “We’re using the highest grade marble, it’s the highest grade everything. It will be brand new.”\n\nQ: Do you plan on tearing the Kennedy Center down and how much will all of the renovations cost?\n\nTRUMP: Probably around $200 million. I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure. We're using some of the marble. pic.twitter.com/Y8iy4QRowg\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 2, 2026\n\nThe late President Kennedy’s familiy were among the many figures decrying the construction project on Sunday, among them Jack Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Joe Kennedy III.\n\n“Trump can take the Kennedy Center for himself,” Schlossberg wrote on X. “He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.”\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former Kennedy Center board member, also spoke out Sunday.\n\n“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with total disregard for Congress,” she wrote in a statement. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period.\n\n“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”\n\nTrump’s takeover of the performing arts center has led to declining performance at the venue’s theatrical and live event box office, with one report last summer finding a 50% drop-off in sales. Artists and executives alike have peeled off and canceled events at the center as well.\n\n“Let’s be clear: remodeling the premises will not restore the Kennedy Center to what it was,” Beatty concluded. “A return to artistic independence will. America’s artists are rejecting this attempted takeover, and the administration knows it. That is why they are now scrambling for cover.”\n\nThe post Trump Says $200 Million Kennedy Center Renovation Will Keep Steel Structure, Gut the Rest: ‘It Will Be Brand New’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "After the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest journalist Don Lemon last week, despite a judge refusing to approve federal charges against him just a week earlier, Lemon is now released. And “The View” host Ana Navarro thinks the president should be worried, because they “picked on the wrong guy.”\n\nDiscussing the arrest during Monday’s Hot Topics, the ABC hosts largely scoffed at the move, calling it a tactic “to send a chilling message to anybody who is covering facts.” Navarro shredded the administration once again for “gaslighting” voters, and being “afraid” of truth getting out.\n\n“And I think they picked on the wrong guy, because Don Lemon is not going to play dead,” she said. “Don Lemon has the wherewithal, has the structure, has the team, has the courage and has the money to fight this administration.”\n\nDON LEMON ARRESTED OVER MN PROTESTS: 'The View' co-hosts react to freedom of press concerns being raised following the arrest of Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of protests at a Minneapolis church. pic.twitter.com/JMnpGQX7Wc\n\n— The View (@TheView) February 2, 2026\n\n“And he’s going to take it as far as it goes,” Navarro continued.\n\nHost Sunny Hostin readily agreed with that and, citing her experience as a former federal prosecutor once again, made an educated guess about how Lemon’s case will go in the legal system.\n\n“You know what happens next is that he will have his day in court, and I suspect that this case will be thrown out,” she said. “This case doesn’t have any merit.”\n\nHostin conceded that she is close friends with Lemon herself, but picked apart the idea that he was impeding any rights, which is what he was charged with.\n\n“I’ve been with Don in Ferguson. I’ve been with Don on the ground in South Carolina. Don is a journalist,” she said. “He’s an on-the-ground journalist. He has been pepper sprayed, he has been tear gassed, and he was getting the story, and nothing should have gotten in the way of that. He had a microphone with him, he had a cameraman with him, and he was practicing journalism.”\n\nYou can watch the full discussion from “The View” in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Host Ana Navarro Says Trump Picked the Wrong Guy to Arrest in Don Lemon: ‘Has the Courage and Has the Money’ to Fight | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "fullText": "Don't expect Kevin Warsh to be a bomb-thrower.\n\nSeveral longtime observers of the Federal Reserve told Business Insider that President Donald Trump's pick to become its next chairman is a good listener who looks for consensus.\n\nThat could prove essential for Warsh, who has emerged as a sometimes-vocal critic since leaving the central bank more than a decade ago. While some Fed watchers criticized Warsh's nomination, citing shifts in his stance on interest rates, others praised his experience and communication skills.\n\nIf confirmed as its next chair, Warsh would need to steer an institution increasingly caught between public pressure and the maintenance of a somewhat frayed internal consensus.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, for not cutting rates faster. That backdrop would likely test any incoming chair's ability to defend the central bank's independence.\n\nFormer colleagues say that Warsh understands the importance of the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That grounding, they say, could help him manage internal debates even as external expectations shift.\n\n\"Warsh has a very valuable skillset of insider experience and outsider critique,\" said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who worked with Warsh after 9/11, when Warsh served under President George W. Bush.\n\nWarsh proved easy to work with and adept at listening, Klein said — skills that matter when a leader must manage disagreement rather than impose direction.\n\nThe chair is only one of 12 votes on monetary policy, though that person also controls the Fed's \"incredibly powerful staff,\" he said.\n\nDonald Kohn, who spent 40 years at the central bank and worked alongside Warsh as a Fed governor, said in a statement to Business Insider that Warsh understands that the Fed's decision-making must remain focused on its dual mandate.\n\nHe has a good ability to read the room, said Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kohn said he worked closely with Warsh during the \"stressful years\" of the 2007-09 global financial crisis.\n\nThe ability to gauge a group's temperature could be critical. Warsh would be returning to a policymaking environment — and to staff and officials — he has publicly criticized in recent years.\n\nCongress set up the Fed so that it would be shielded from political pressure to juice the economy by slashing rates — and risk subsequent inflation.\n\n\"He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,\" Kohn said.\n\nThat matters in part because the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term rates, is divided; it hasn't voted unanimously since July. The committee was again split at its January meeting, when 10 members, including Powell, voted to hold on rates, while two sought a cut.\n\nIn recent years, Warsh has sharpened his critiques of the Fed, including in speeches and in his academic work at Stanford. In a 2023 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he called for \"regime change\" in US economic policy. Warsh criticized the Fed for being too slow to corral inflation after policymakers slashed borrowing costs in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKlein, who was a lead Democratic staffer on Warsh's original Senate confirmation in 2006, said that Warsh's critiques from academia have been \"reasonable and thoughtful.\"\n\nKlein added that Warsh's experience makes him an ideal operator to make changes at the central bank if he's once again confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"I hope he shakes up the Fed's decision-making process, which has gotten most of the major bank regulatory questions dead wrong over the last 30 years, while maintaining the Fed's independence on monetary policy,\" Klein said.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the critique.\n\nNot everyone sees Warsh as a change agent, despite his criticisms. There is a risk that his instinct to seek common ground could become a limitation, Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told Business Insider.\n\n\"He's consensus-oriented and not willing to jump too far out in front of the committee,\" Brusuelas said.\n\nIn reading policymaking transcripts from Warsh's time at the Fed, from 2006 to 2011, he came off as a follower rather than a leader, Brusuelas said.\n\n\"He's an echo, not the tip of the spear,\" he said.\n\nA leadership style that's focused on common consent and \"organized around protecting the status quo\" means that Warsh will likely \"always be late\" to needed policy shifts due to domestic or external shocks, Brusuelas said.\n\nWarsh didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAsked about the criticism, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that to restore confidence at the Fed, the president's primary considerations for a new chairman were \"competence and experience.\"\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is eminently qualified to hold the job,\" Desai said.\n\nFamed economist Mohamed El-Erian likewise sees Warsh as a good fit, writing on X that Warsh \"brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills.\"",

    "fullText": "If Trevor Noah really wanted a response from Donald Trump on his mocking question of “What are you going to do about it?” during the Grammys on Sunday night, the former Apprentice host just gave it to him, maybe.\n\nAs he has with so many critics, those who poke fun at him and almost anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump is threatening to take Noah to court.\n\nTrevor Noah Takes Shots At Nicki Minaj, Donald Trump’s Epstein Association & More During Grammys Show\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nAlex Warren Shares What He Heard During Grammy Audio Glitch: \"This Would Only Happen To Me\"\n\n“It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty,” the notoriously thin-skinned Trump posted online Sunday, not long after the Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny dominated the 68th annual Grammy Awards on CBS. “Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\nProving that he loves to watch and loves to remind everyone who has already kissed the ring and written the checks, POTUS’ long, enraged and uppercase-strewn post on his Truth Social platform denounced the music industry’s big night and Noah’s last turn as Grammy host. No surprise, it was all because of a bipartisan crack by the ex-Daily Show host about that past presidential pal and deceased pedophile Epstein — as you can see here:\n\nTrevor Noah takes another jab at Donald Trump #Grammys: “Song of the Year — that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein’s island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton” pic.twitter.com/quUWEpX4NL\n\n— Deadline (@DEADLINE) February 2, 2026\n\nGenerating a roar from the music crowd over his swipe at Trump, Noah’s quip of “what are you going to do about it?” was born out of the reality that 2026 is going to be his final time hosting the Grammys after several years fronting the shindig.\n\nTrump didn’t give a toss about any of that.\n\n“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump digitally raged. “WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\nThe remarks by Noah and the reaction by Trump comes just a couple of days after the MAGA Overlord’s Department of Justice dumped millions of redacted pages and hundreds of thousands of black-barred images from the long-delayed and much-anticipated Epstein Files. Still, with speculation that there is much more not out there despite congressional demands, Trump’s name comes up various times in what was released on January 30, including some pretty horrific allegations and new details. Among those also mentioned are L.A. Olympics boss Casey Wasserman, Elon Musk, ex-POTUS Clinton, Melania docu director Brett Ratner, Bill Gates (and some “Russian girl”), Jay-Z, the now-former Prince Andrew of Windsor, Harvey Weinstein, and of course Epstein’s right-hand lady and current federal convict Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile admitting he knew Epstein back in the roaring ’80s and ’90s, Trump always has denied he got up to anything inappropriate with or via him. As accusations against the one-time openly philandering Trump have been made by alleged Epstein victims and others (as well as cringy video of Trump and Epstein and correspondence between the two), little has made it to the courts connecting him to the horrors of sex trafficking and more.\n\nSuspicion of how deep Trump really went with Epstein, who died in 2019 by what was termed suicide in police custody has become a benchmark for Democrats and others – even when the likes of Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers have also been caught in the ugly web. The massive files release of January 30 even found Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche having to insist more than once the DOJ wasn’t and hadn’t been covering up for POTUS — to almost no avail.\n\nHaving started on CBS when Trump hero Richard Nixon was in the White House in 1973, tonight was the last time the Grammys will be seen on the now David Ellison-owned network.\n\nStarting in 2027, the ceremony will be broadcast on ABC as part of the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. As the Oscars leave ABC for YouTube in 2029, the Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from next year all the way to 2036 – when a then 90-year-old Trump will almost certainly not be president, maybe.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "The president self-soothed by going on a Truth Social posting spree after the Republican Party suffered a major upset in Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, made seven posts in the span of just three minutes on Sunday afternoon and reposted six endorsements he made over the last week after a Democratic candidate secured a decisive victory in Texas’ deep-red 9th State Senate District, which he carried by more than 17 points in 2024.\n\nFirst-time candidate Taylor Rehmet, 33, became the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades after handing a resounding defeat to MAGA activist Leigh Wambsganss, 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\nTrump played nonchalant after the stunning loss in the solidly Republican district by touting the supposed success of his policies.\n\nThe president reposted opinion pieces from the Des Moines Register and Bari Weiss-founded The Free Press titled, “Iowans are earning more, paying less after Trump’s return” and “How Trump Won Davos.”\n\nTrump also published a screenshot of a Jan. 26 X post by Roma Daravi, vice president for public relations of the newly MAGA-fied Kennedy Center, thanking him for “saving America’s cultural center.”\n\nThe president posted another screenshot, this time going all the way back to Dec. 3 last year, of an X post by Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar lavishing praise for Trump’s “tremendous leadership.” At the time, Trump had pardoned Cuellar, who was indicted on a dozen charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump bragged about receiving a letter dated Feb. 23, 1989, from convicted felon George M. Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Some Jeffrey Epstein stories are horrifying. This one is just deeply uncomfortable.\n\nNewly released documents tied to the late sex offender have resurfaced a bizarre anecdote, reported by TMZ, involving a friend of Donald Trump and his then-wife, Marla Maples.\n\nThe allegation closely echoes a notorious shoe fetish scandal from the 1990s, though it remains unclear whether the incidents involve the same person.\n\nIn a 2016 email to author and new age guru Deepak Chopra, unsealed as part of the Justice Department’s latest document dump, Epstein claims Maples could recount “the story of her friend who was caught having sex with her shoes.”\n\nWhen Chopra asks whether Maples was wearing the shoes at the time, Epstein clarifies that she was not. Instead, he alleges the man had cut holes into the backs of Maples’s high heels and was caught engaging in a sexual act with them.\n\nEpstein does not name the individual or explain how he knows the story. He simply drops it as gossip—something Maples herself, he suggests, could confirm.\n\nThe claim closely resembles a real and widely reported case from the early ’90s involving Maples’ former publicist, Chuck Jones, who was convicted after dozens of her shoes went missing.\n\nAt trial, Jones admitted to having what he described as a “sexual relationship” with Maples’ shoes.\n\nAccording to contemporaneous reporting, Maples testified that Trump’s organization installed a hidden security camera in her apartment after her footwear repeatedly disappeared.\n\nOn July 13, 1992, the camera reportedly captured Jones rummaging through her closet. When confronted, he allowed a search of his office, where investigators discovered more than 70 pairs of Maples’ shoes.\n\n“We really felt like he needed help,” one juror told The New York Post after convicting Jones of burglary, describing him as “obsessive” and “not normal.”\n\nJones himself testified that he was sexually aroused by “the imprint of the foot inside” a shoe.\n\nThe New Yorker captured the surreal tone of the trial in a 1994 “Talk of the Town” column, describing a witness brought in solely to assess the value of the seized shoes.\n\nAs she examined pair after pair on the stand, the judge interjected, “Next case. Er, next shoe.”\n\nThe magazine reported that Jones had slashed Maples’ boots “to better see the imprint of her foot.”\n\nEpstein’s email does not reference Jones, the trial, or the earlier reporting. Whether he was referring to that same incident, a different individual, or simply repackaging a well-known scandal as insider gossip remains unclear.\n\nWhat is new is Epstein’s retelling—years later—as proof of his proximity to Trumpworld intimacy.\n\nTrump and Maples were married from 1993 to 1999, overlapping with Trump’s well-documented social relationship with Epstein.\n\nWhile the shoe story is among the stranger claims to resurface in the files, it fits a familiar pattern: Epstein trading in secrets, rumors, and grotesque anecdotes to present himself as a knowing insider to people who would later insist they barely knew him.",

Never more so than in recent weeks, when federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens during Trump'scrackdownin Minneapolis.  “In the beginning, they were getting criminals, but now they're tearing people out of immigration proceedings, looking for the tiniest traffic infraction” to deport someone, said Niedermeier.",
    "fullText": "GREELEY, Colo (AP) — Like many Donald Trump voters, Miranda Niedermeier is not opposed to immigration enforcement. She was heartened by initial moves from the Republican president in his second term that she saw as targeting immigrants who were in the United States illegally and had committed crimes.\n\nBut Niedermeier, 35, has steadily become disillusioned with Trump. Never more so than in recent weeks, when federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens during Trump'scrackdownin Minneapolis.\n\n“In the beginning, they were getting criminals, but now they're tearing people out of immigration proceedings, looking for the tiniest traffic infraction” to deport someone, said Niedermeier. She said she is horrified because the administration's approach is not Christian.\n\n“It shouldn't be life and death,\" she said. \"We're not a Third World country. What the hell is going on?”\n\nTrump's immigration drive in Minnesota, and the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, has resonated across the farms, oil and gas rigs, and shopping centers of Colorado's 8th Congressional District, a swing seat stretching northeast from Denver. The monthlong turmoil in Minnesota has reinforced the political views of some in the U.S. House district while making others reconsider their own.\n\n“He should cool it on immigration,” said Edgar Cautle, a 30-year-old Mexican American oil field worker who said he is a Trump fan but is increasingly distressed by images of immigration agents detaining children and splitting families apart. “It's making people not like him.”\n\nRepublican congressman wants ICE to focus on criminals\n\nIf such sentiments hold until the fall, that could imperil House Republicans who won their seats by narrow margins and could jeopardize the GOP’s full control of political power in Washington.\n\nEven a small shift is significant in the 8th District, where Republican Gabe Evans was elected to Congress in 2024 by 2,449 votes out of more than 333,000 cast. His seat is one of the Democrats' top targets as they push to retake the House in November.\n\nEvans is a former police officer whose mother is Mexican American. He has urged the administration to focus on deporting criminals rather than people in the country illegally who are otherwise obeying the law — as Evans puts it, “gangbangers, not grandmas.”\n\nIn an interview, Evans said he is worried about the assertion by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that it can search homes with just an administrative warrant rather than one signed by a judge. He said he looks forward to questioning Department of Homeland Security officials during an upcoming House hearing.\n\nStill, Evans blamed Democrats for the Minneapolis standoff and the broader impression that ICE is out of control.\n\n“One side wants to fan the flames and equivocate in this space because they want an issue to run on in November,” he said.\n\nHe noted that ICE has stepped lightly in his district, with narrowly tailored operations aimed at criminals rather than the local industries that rely on immigrant workers.\n\n“We have big meatpacking plants, we have big dairies, we have places where, if ICE was trying to meet a quota, you would see ICE going to them,” Evans said.\n\nVoters conflicted over approach to immigration enforcement\n\nSome 4 of 10 voters in Evans' district are Hispanic. In more than two dozen interviews across the district, every voter who identified as Hispanic spoke of being offended by Trump's immigration crackdown. Many — U.S. citizens all — feared for their own safety.\n\n“I don't know if, just because of my last name or how I look, they might go after me,” said Jennifer Hernandez, 30, as she entered a Walmart in the town of Brighton.\n\nPlenty of other voters supported the Minnesota operation, even after the shootings of Good and Pretti.\n\n“They've got to clean up the immigrants, definitely,” said Herb Smith, a 61-year-old generator installer and Trump voter.\n\nSmith, who is Black, said he once lived in Minneapolis and left because of the Somali immigrants who have drawn Trump's ire: “Trump's right, these people are poisoning our people.”\n\nDominic Morrison, 39, a telecommunications technician, said he does not like to see people lose their lives, but feels enforcing immigration laws is necessary.\n\n“I know everybody wants a better life and better situation, but if I went somewhere else without permission they wouldn't take nicely to it,” Morrison said.\n\nRacial profiling has some ‘walking on eggshells’\n\nDemocrats in the district said they are enraged by the enforcement surge and blame Evans along with Trump.\n\n“He's said nothing against it,” said Jim Getman, a retired electrical technician who volunteered for Democrats in 2024. “He's always supported Trump in everything he does.”\n\nJoe Hernandez, 27, pays far less attention to politics. But the forklift operator and his family members — all citizens or legal residents — are fearful they could be swept up by immigration officers who are racially profiling people.\n\n“We're walking on eggshells right now,” Hernandez said as he filled up a water jug at a tap outside a Mexican supermarket in Commerce City, a heavily immigrant city at the southern end of the 8th District.\n\nHernandez said it has gotten so bad that he and his four siblings, all citizens born in the United States have considered moving to property his family owns in Mexico for their safety. He did not vote in 2024 and has never cast a ballot before, like many he knows.\n\nHe intends to change that this year, and he thinks he is not the only one.\n\n“More people are like, oh ... we've got to vote,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump moved quickly this week to negotiate with Democrats to try and avert a lengthy government shutdown over Department of Homeland Security funding, a sharp departure from last year’s record standoff, when he refused to budge for weeks.\n\nSome Republicans are frustrated with the deal, raising the possible of a prolonged shutdown fight when the House returns Monday to vote on the funding package. But Trump's sway over the GOP remains considerable, and he has made his position clear at a moment of mounting political strain.\n\n“The only thing that can slow our country down is another long and damaging government shutdown,” Trump wrote on social media late Thursday.\n\nThe urgency marked a clear shift from Trump’s posture during the 43-day shutdown late last year, when he publicly antagonized Democratic leaders and his team mocked them on social media. This time, with anger rising over shootings in Minneapolis and the GOP's midterm messaging on tax cuts drowned out by controversy, Trump acted quickly to make a deal with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\n“Trump and the Republicans know that this is an issue where they’re on the wrong side of the American people and it really matters,” Schumer told reporters Friday after Senate passage of the government funding deal.\n\nThe crisis caused by Minneapolis killings\n\nSenators returned to work this week dealing with the fallout from the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal immigration officers, as well as the killing of Renee Good in the city weeks earlier.\n\nRepublicans were far from unified in their response. A few called for the firing of top administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the White House chief of staff for policy. Most GOP senators tried to strike a balance, calling for a thorough investigation into Pretti’s killing while backing the hard-line immigration approach that is central to Trump’s presidency.\n\nBut many agreed that the shootings threatened public support for Trump's immigration agenda.\n\n“I’ve never seen a political party take its best issue and turn it into its worst issue in the period of time that it has happened in the last few weeks,” said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. “Some things have to change.”\n\nDemocrats quickly coalesced around their key demands.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said there “was unanimity” around core principles of enforcing a code of conduct for immigration officers and agents, ending “roving patrols” for immigration enforcement actions and coordinating with local law enforcement on immigration arrests.\n\nIt helped that Trump himself was looking for ways to de-escalate in Minneapolis.\n\n“The world has seen the videos of those horrible abuses by DHS and rogue operations catching up innocent people, and there’s a revulsion about it,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.\n\n“The White House is asking for a ladder off the ledge,” he added.\n\nAvoiding the painful politics of a shutdown\n\nRepublicans are also trying to promote their accomplishments in office as they ready for the November elections and the difficult task of retaining control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nBut the prospect of a prolonged shutdown shifted attention away from their $4.5 trillion tax and spending cuts law, the centerpiece of their agenda. Republicans had hoped the beginning of this year's tax season on Monday would provide a political boost as voters begin to see larger tax refunds.\n\nRepublicans are also mindful of the political damage from last year's shutdown, when they took a slightly larger portion of the blame from Americans than Democrats, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\n“The shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans,” Trump told Republican senators at the White House in November.\n\nOn a practical level, this funding standoff threatened to destroy months of bipartisan work, including long hours over the holiday break, to craft the 12 spending bills that fund the government and many priorities back home.\n\n“We saw what happened in the last government shutdown in regards to how it hurt real, hardworking Americans,” said Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “I don’t want that to happen again.”\n\nA two-week funding battle begins\n\nThe agreement reached this week, if passed by the House, would avoid a prolonged shutdown and fund nearly every federal department through the end of the budget year in September. But it would not resolve one of the most difficult issues for Congress and the White House: DHS funding.\n\nInstead of a full-year deal, funding for the department was extended for just two weeks, giving lawmakers little time to bridge the deep divides over immigration enforcement.\n\nDemocrats are pressing for changes they say are necessary to prevent future abuses, including requiring immigration agents to wear body cameras, carry clear identification, end roving patrols in cities and coordinate more closely with local law enforcement when making arrests. Many Democrats also want tighter rules around warrants and accountability mechanisms for officers in the field.\n\nThose demands have met stiff resistance from Republicans. Some are opposed to negotiating with Democrats at all.\n\n“Republicans control the White House, Senate and House. Why are we giving an inch to Democrats?” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., wrote on social media.\n\nRepublican senators said they would take the fight to Democrats by introducing their own bills, including restrictions on “sanctuary cities,” to show their support for Trump's policies. That term is generally applied to state and local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\n“We’ve let the issue get away. We’re not leading. We’re trying to avoid losing rather than winning,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who held up the spending bills until Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to give him a vote on his sanctuary cities bill at a later date.\n\nThune acknowledged the difficulty of the next two weeks, saying there are “some pretty significant views and feelings.”\n\n“We’ll stay hopeful,” Thune told reporters about the upcoming DHS fight. “But there are some pretty significant differences of opinion.”",

But Democrats are now demanding significantly more after a second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal law enforcement during demonstrations against Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nSenate Gop Holdouts Refuse To Budge As Shutdown Talks Continue\n\nThe new deal struck with Democrats would only extend current DHS funding levels for two weeks to keep other critical agencies under the department’s purview funded while new bipartisan negotiations on immigration enforcement play out.\n\nMultiple Republican lawmakers have both publicly and privately expressed concern about the deal, arguing it could potentially give Democrats more ability to constrain the administration.\n\nOne House Republican voiced such concerns on the lawmaker-only call on Friday, Fox News Digital was told. Johnson, according to sources, agreed he was \"frustrated … but I've got to tip my hat to the president. He knows the art of the deal.\"\n\nSenate Republicans Weigh Dem Demand To Split Dhs Bill, Turn To Short-term Extension To Avoid Shutdown\n\nJohnson told House Republicans that Trump now needed their support to \"navigate the next two weeks\" of deal-making with Democrats.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social of his deal with Democrats, \"I am working hard with Congress to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before).\"\n\nSources said the speaker did sound optimistic about Republicans still having leverage in the talks, however. Johnson noted that ICE had already been funded under Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill\" and that it would be offices like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that would run low on funds.\n\nSources said Johnson said of Democrats, \"We can hang that on their necks.\"\n\nThe House is expected to take up the legislation by Monday evening.\n\nOriginal article source: 'Opening Pandora's Box': Mike Johnson backs Trump after warning White House about deal with Democrats",

    "description": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit) By Brad Brooks and Joseph Ax MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters)",
    "fullText": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was \"playing with fire\" for insisting that local police would refrain from enforcing federal immigration laws, a day after the president said he intended to \"de-escalate a ​little bit\" in the city.\n\nAmid the mixed signals from the White House, tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists said deportation raids carried out by Trump's \"Operation Metro Surge\" had not slackened but ‌seemed more targeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe city has been convulsed by running confrontations between protesters and heavily armed immigration agents, with unrest heightened after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers - Renee Good on January 7 and Alex Pretti on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrations have spread to cities large and ‌small across the country in recent weeks, with Minneapolis finding its way into the pop culture on Wednesday as singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen released a protest song honoring Pretti and Good.\n\nIn one sign of how immigration agents might be changing their tactics, an internal memo reviewed by Reuters directed officers to avoid unnecessary communication and engagement with protesters.\n\nA day after striking a conciliatory tone in their public comments following weeks of heated rhetoric, Trump and other top administration officials were talking tough again on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social that federal agents had arrested 16 people on Wednesday in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.\n\n\"Nothing will stop us from continuing to make arrests and enforce the law,\" Bondi ⁠wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said on Wednesday that it was the U.S. ‌Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was flouting the law by ignoring dozens of federal court orders during the immigration enforcement surge this month.\n\nWhile canceling a contempt-of-court hearing for acting ICE chief Todd Lyons, after the agency belatedly complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man, U.S. District Judge Patrick Schlitz listed at least 96 court orders he said ‍ICE has violated in 74 cases.\n\n\"This list should give pause to anyone - no matter his or her political beliefs - who cares about the rule of law,\" Schlitz wrote. \"ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2025 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.\"\n\nAt the same time, the two immigration officers who opened fire on Pretti have been placed on administrative leave, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, adding that it was \"standard protocol.\"\n\nTrump's administration had indicated on Tuesday ​it would soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism and legal challenges.\n\nA senior administration official said Homan's arrival ‌would mark a shift to more traditional, narrowly aimed operations rather than the broad street sweeps Bovino had led in multiple cities.\n\nThat change appeared codified in a newly issued internal ICE directive instructing agents to avoid engaging with \"agitators\" while on duty, warning that an antagonistic posture \"serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation.\"\n\nThe guidance, reviewed by Reuters, also orders ICE officers only to go after immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions, a departure from earlier tactics that had included randomly questioning individuals on the street about their immigration status.\n\nObservers and activists told Reuters that ICE activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday, though in a more targeted manner than before.\n\nOn Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific ⁠person.\n\nIf that person were not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun approaching people ​and demanding documented proof of legal status.\n\nUnder mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his rhetorical attacks on Frey and Governor ​Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to ease friction.\n\nBut on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for reiterating the position of local leaders that the city would not enforce immigration laws. Trump wrote: \"Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the ‍Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!\"\n\nTrump has threatened ⁠to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.\n\nIn response, Frey wrote on social media, \"The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws.\"\n\nPretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill officers, citing the handgun ⁠he was carrying.\n\nBut video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a ‌restrained Pretti in the back.",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, praised U.S. President Donald Trump as an effective leader who was seeking peace but added that Moscow had seen no trace of nuclear submarines Trump said he moved to Russian shores.\n\nTrump, who has said he wants to be remembered as a \"peacemaker\" president, has repeatedly said that a peace deal to end the Ukraine war is close, and a new round of U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian talks is scheduled for this week in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAsked if Trump was positive or negative for Russia and about unproven speculation that Trump was some sort of Russian agent, Medvedev said the American people had chosen Trump and that Moscow respected that decision.\n\nMedvedev lauded Trump’s courage in resisting the U.S. establishment and said the U.S. president’s sometimes \"brash\" style was \"effective\".\n\n\"He is an emotional person, but on the other hand, the chaos that is commonly referred to, which is created by his activities, is not entirely true,\" he told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow and authorised for publication on Sunday.\n\n\"It is obvious that behind this lies a completely conscious and competent line,\" said Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin remains the final voice on Russian policy, though Medvedev, an arch-hawk who has repeatedly goaded Trump on social media, gives a sense of hardliners’ thinking within the Russian elite, according to foreign diplomats.\n\n\"Trump wants to go down in history as a peacemaker - and he is really trying,\" Medvedev said. \"He is really trying to do that. And that is why contacts with Americans have become much more productive.\"\n\nMedvedev said the key to understanding Trump was his business background, quipping that there was no such thing as a former businessman - a play on an old Russian joke that there is no such thing as a former KGB agent.\n\nTrump in August said he had ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to what he called \"highly provocative\" comments from Medvedev about the risk of war after what appeared to be an ultimatum from Trump.\n\n\"We still have not found them,\" Medvedev said of the U.S. submarines.\n\nAfter Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear \"apocalypse\".\n\nMedvedev said Russia would \"soon\" win military victory in the Ukraine war but the key thing was to prevent any further conflict, adding: \"I would like this to happen as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"But it is equally important to think about what will happen next. After all, the goal of victory is to prevent new conflicts. This is absolutely obvious.\"\n\nRussia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine but has so far been unable to take the whole of the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces hold about 10%, or 5,000 square km (1,900 square miles), according to open-source maps of the war.",

    "description": "Rambling speeches, wind turbine obsession, and an ‘unhinged’ letter to Norway’s prime minister have caused concern whether the rest of his term is ‘sustainable’",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, Richard Nixon “came unglued”, said Jamelle Bouie in The New York Times. He reportedly became irrational and obsessive, making wild suggestions and rambling about his past triumphs. His son-in-law and adviser Ed Cox recalled that Nixon would wander the halls of the White House “talking to pictures of former presidents”.\n\nAlas, it seems Donald Trump has reached similar depths of “self-destructive mania”. Witness his recent unhinged letter to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, in which Trump implied that he was entitled to seize Greenland owing to Norway’s failure to award him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhere to begin? Norway’s government doesn’t choose the winner of the prize. Nor does it own Greenland. And Trump hasn’t, as he insisted, “stopped 8 Wars PLUS”, or anything close. “We have three years left with a mad king. It does not feel sustainable.”\n\n“Trump has the world’s most consequential case of untreated logorrhea,” said Susan B. Glasser in The New Yorker. According to a new study, in this first year of his second term he has spoken 1,977,609 words in presidential appearances – 145% more than in the first year of his first term.\n\nIn his speech in Davos last week, he rambled on for a full hour and a half. In the course of his address he, among other things, explained that only “stupid people” buy wind turbines, and admitted that he had decided to raise tariffs on Switzerland because its prime minister – “a woman” – had “rubbed me the wrong way”. He also kept confusing Iceland and Greenland. Americans are somewhat inured to Trump’s “manic performance art”, but the stunned reaction of Europeans should be a wake-up call. Many there were openly asking: has this man lost his mind? Is he still capable of running the US?\n\nIn “a saner, better world”, Trump’s cabinet officials would be discussing invoking the 25th Amendment, said Jim Geraghty in National Review. But of course none of them would dare suggest he was unfit to discharge his powers. Nor did President Biden’s colleagues when he started zoning out in meetings and forgot the name of his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, referring to him in an interview simply as “the black man”.\n\n“After one president who went senile in office and another who is nuttier than a Payday candy bar, we can only conclude that the 25th Amendment of the Constitution is there for decoration.”",

    "fullText": "CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle began coughing and choking live on camera when Trump ICE agents fired pepper balls into a crowd of protesters at an ICE facility in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s OutFront, anchor Erin Burnett tossed to Miracle as she reported from LA amid protests across the country against Trump’s deportation forces.\n\nWhen ICE fired on the crowd, Miracle exclaimed “I just got hit!” and choked on the chemical irritant for a considerable stretch — then kept reporting:\n\nBURNETT: I want to go straight to Veronica Miracle because she is there on the ground in L.A., where the crowd that I know that is around you, Veronica, is on ICE property. What are you seeing?\n\nVERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it’s really intense here. And, Erin, I just — we just all got pepper sprayed. And so I’m just still recovering from that. There’s so much of the pepper spray still in the air and so, so many people around us coughing and gagging, including us.\n\nSo, it’s been a really interesting scene here. I’ve never seen this before in all of my years covering protests here in this area, here in downtown L.A., where they were actually, these protesters were able to get onto the property. There was a skirmish line of police officers of Department of Homeland Security officers. They were in a bit of a line, and the protesters overtook them and were able to basically push them further and further back all the way to the loading dock, where they essentially cornered all of them and pushed them back inside.\n\nThere was, you know, a bit of a skirmish. There were some pepper spray, people were throwing bottles, but ultimately these protesters have overtaken this property, which I have never seen before. Usually, police are here and they’re able to keep protesters off of the property.\n\nThis is a crowd that is kind of at the tail end of a very long protest. This started at 1:00 p.m. local over in city hall. Okay, I just got hit! Hold on, hold on. I just got — sorry.\n\nBURNETT: All right, take your time there, Veronica.\n\nMIRACLE: Sorry. I can’t breathe. I’m sorry.\n\nBURNETT: Take your time. Take your time. Right. Let’s just make sure Veronica’s okay.\n\nMIRACLE: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah.\n\nUNIDNETIFIED MALE; Let’s go back.\n\nMIRACLE: All right. So obviously, they’re — they’re shooting. They’re shooting something. Pepper balls or something. So, it looks like you can see an officer back there. He’s alone, and they’re just throwing things at him.\n\nI mean, it’s just pretty incredible that these protesters have overtaken this. And there’s really. There’s no police.\n\nI don’t see anybody here to kind of manage this crowd. So like I was saying, this is at the tail end of a very long day. It looks like they’re — they’re cheering because they were able to push that officer back inside.

    "description": "Since President Trump made threats about Greenland, the continent’s leaders have debated the rapid deterioration of U.S. ties in policy papers and at dinner.",
    "fullText": "After President Trump shocked the world last week by threatening Europe with economic pain, humiliating its politicians and excoriating their values, leaders from across the continent wrestled with the fallout the next day at an emergency dinner meeting in Brussels.\n\nThe dishes were neat and traditional — chicken supreme, a classic French comfort food, with vanilla roast parsnips — but the question on the table was messy and recent. What should Europe do to cope with the rapid deterioration of its relationship with the United States, most recently manifested in Mr. Trump’s obsessive pursuit of Greenland?\n\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, an ideological ally of Mr. Trump on many issues, arrived at the meeting urging ongoing dialogue with the president. Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany pushed for immediate steps to reduce business regulations across Europe, to lift growth and reduce dependence on the American economy. President Emmanuel Macron of France said that to win respect from Mr. Trump, Europe must show a willingness to strike back against his threats.\n\nDeliberations ran into the early hours of the morning. What emerged was a sort of playbook for how to deal with a Trump administration that is expected to remain volatile, according to three officials briefed on the meeting and leaders’ public statements. The leaders’ plan is to remain calm during Mr. Trump’s future provocations, threaten to hit back with tariffs and, the officials said, work behind the scenes to make Europe less militarily and economically dependent on its increasingly unreliable ally. The officials requested anonymity to speak about the politically sensitive discussions.\n\nThe playbook — a relatively bold but still largely abstract approach — was an example of how Europe’s leaders were now verbally pushing harder than ever against Mr. Trump and yet are still struggling to bolster their statements with action.\n\nTo keep Mr. Trump placated in the short term, Europeans are talking about how to beef up Arctic security. To lessen their reliance on Washington in the long term, they are working to diversify their trade relationships, improve their militaries and make their countries less dependent on American technology.\n\nYet they still have no workable plan to rapidly establish military autonomy from the United States. Their financial and banking system remains fragmented, making it hard to finance ambitious projects. Their decision-making is protracted, and their leaders are divided over how to enact what could be a yearslong or even decades-long project to reduce their trans-Atlantic dependency.\n\n“The past few weeks have made it painfully clear that the European Union often drifts on waves created by others, that we are too dependent on factors beyond our control and have not built on our strengths enough,” Prime Minister Bart De Wever of Belgium, who attended the dinner in Brussels, later told Belgian lawmakers.\n\nThe German and Italian governments jointly produced a brief policy paper last week, after a meeting of Mr. Merz and Ms. Meloni, that illustrated both a rising desire to increase Europe’s strategic independence as well as the obstacles to that goal.\n\nThe document urged immediate moves to cut regulations and kindle investment, including long-debated steps to create a single continental capital market and a Pan-European stock exchange. It will help to frame the next meeting of E.U. leaders, an informal gathering on Feb. 12 that the Germans and the Italians hope will produce immediate results.\n\nWhen it comes to diversifying relationships, officials wrote in the paper, “We need more ambition, more focus, and more speed.”\n\nPerhaps the most concrete steps Europe is taking are on trade. This past week, European leaders announced a long-sought trade agreement with India, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, in an effort to open markets outside America. It was one of a rash of trade deals officials have been working on to secure supply chains and future customers.\n\nFreeing itself from dependencies on imported semiconductors, rare earths, American technology products and American arms would give Europe more leverage in its partnership with the United States — and more ability to respond to the tariff threats that have become a feature of Mr. Trump’s second-term foreign policy. Before softening his position over Greenland, the Danish territory that Mr. Trump covets, Mr. Trump had suggested he could use trade coercion to obtain the island.\n\nMr. Trump’s threats over Greenland also prompted Europeans to talk more urgently about reducing their military dependence on Washington.\n\nMette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, said in Berlin this past week that Europe must spend what it takes to fully defend itself by 2030. German defense officials have said that they want to be self-sufficient by 2029. The European Union is helping to accelerate that effort and this week took a step toward giving eight European countries access to loans worth billions of euros that will allow them to improve their military infrastructure.\n\nEuropean officials are also scaling up plans to jointly protect the Arctic from Russia and China, hoping to show Mr. Trump that they can do their part to protect American interests in the polar region without ceding Greenland.\n\nThe operation, led by NATO, would potentially be called “Arctic Sentry,” a nod to similarly named alliance missions of maritime surveillance and air patrols over the Baltic Sea and Eastern Europe. Officials and experts said that the Arctic operation would also extend reconnaissance missions, relying heavily on drones, that some alliance members have already launched in the High North to shadow and search for Russian ships and submarines.\n\nThe top French general met with Swedish troops last week to enhance Arctic cooperation. Other countries, including Italy, are adapting some of their Alpine brigades to Arctic operations, Minna Alander, an expert on Arctic security, told a panel at the Center for European Policy Analysis this month. And the British military said in January that it was broadening its deployments in northern Norway.\n\nLike many European moves, the flurry of Arctic activity is more conceptual than actionable. Discussions over the proposed NATO campaign in the Arctic are still at a very early stage, according to one current and one former NATO official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nDivisions between some NATO members might slow any progress. The operation, both officials said, would have to steer clear of a demilitarized island near the North Pole to avoid objections from an ally, Turkey, that has scientists stationed there. Canada, at least until recently, has been reluctant to cede more defense responsibilities to NATO. Such tensions risk projecting a sense of disunity, undermining Europe just as it tries to strengthen.\n\n“Everyone has got national interests, but we need to be cautious about what and how we do things, and say and communicate things,” Gen. Karel Rehka, chief of the Czech armed forces, said in an interview. “We don’t want to send the wrong signals to any potential adversary.”\n\nSimilar differences have emerged in Europe over whether Ukraine is a more pressing priority than the Arctic. Some leaders, particularly in countries closer to Ukraine, are reluctant to stand up to Mr. Trump over Greenland when Europe still needs him to help Kyiv defend against Russia, experts and officials say.\n\n“For Poland and the Baltics, the idea of defending Greenland is problematic,” said Rosa Balfour, the head of Carnegie Europe, a research group in Brussels. “Ukraine is the priority.”\n\nThere is at least one familiar strategy with Mr. Trump that Europeans continue to fall back on: patience, while they wait to see what Mr. Trump says and does next.\n\nDenmark and Greenland are still waiting for a serious American offer that could expand the U.S. presence on the island without granting ownership, said Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, head of the Center for Arctic Security Studies at the Royal Danish Defense College.\n\n“That would be the cleverest way, to offer a significant carrot,” he said. “The problem for the Americans is that there’s been a lot of stick, but it’s very vague what the carrot is.”\n\nChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin, and Koba Ryckewaert from Brussels.",

    "description": "Among the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made withe the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump arrives for the premiere of first lady Melania Trump’s movie “Melania” at The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center For The Performing Arts, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2026, in Washington. \n\nAmong the latest Epstein files dump is a list of wild complaints made with the FBI that include wild allegations against President Donald Trump and others from uncorroborated tips.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Friday that thousands of new documents related to the case of convicted child sex predator Jeffrey Epstein were being released.\n\nThe latest drop comes as the administration has faced complaints from critics over its failure to release all the files by a December 19 deadline previously set by Congress.\n\nOn Friday, Blanche announced 3.5 million new files were being released to comply with the Epstein Transparency Act. Among them is a list of allegations made against the president, a former friend of Epstein’s. In FBI email communications — which note some of the allegations come secondhand — various allegations are listed that involve Trump, Epstein, and others.\n\nIt should be noted that these complaints are uncorroborated tips to the FBI, and the existence of those tips does not indicate eventual credibility.\n\nBlanche said the White House had no oversight on the latest documents released. He told Fox News that there has been no evidence of criminal conduct by the president found in the Epstein files.\n\n“In none of these communications, even when doing his best to disparage President Trump, did Epstein suggest President Trump had done anything criminal or had any inappropriate contact with any of his victims,” he said.\n\nTrump himself has long denied any wrongdoing in his friendship with Epstein.\n\nSince their original publication, the complaints mentioning Trump have been removed from the DOJ website with a “page not found” message being given to people trying to search for them. The complaints, however, have been widely copied and shared on social media.\n\nCNN’s Jake Tapper was among those who noted the DOJ pulling the files.\n\nDOJ has since killed this link. This is what was there: https://t.co/urnzMvyccO pic.twitter.com/qXXmQNYhu7\n\nTrump Accused of Raping Teenager\n\nIn a complaint made by a friend, the president was accused of forcing a 13-14-year-old to perform oral sex on him.\n\n“[Redacted] reported an unidentified female friend who was forced to perform oral sex on President Trump approximately 35 years ago in NJ. The friend told Alexis that she was approximately 13-14 years old when this occurred, and the friend allegedly bit President Trump while performing oral sex. The friend was allegedly hit in the face after she laughed about biting President Trump. The friend said she was also abused by Epstein,” the complaint reads.\n\nIn the “response” column, it is noted that an investigator was sent to Washington to conduct an interview.\n\nTrump Accused of Being Present While Newborn ‘Murdered’\n\nAnother in Epstein’s orbit also made allegations of “sex trafficking” and murder. The unidentified person was following up on a tip given to the NYPD in which the person alleged they were raped at 13. The person also alleged Trump regularly paid them to perform sexual acts and claimed he was present when her newborn child was murdered.\n\n“Complainant reported Donald Trump participated regularly in paying money to force her to perform sex acts with him and alleged Trump was present when her uncle murdered her newborn child,” notes on the complaint read.\n\nAccording to the paperwork, there was “no contact made.”\n\nMar-a-Lago ‘Calendar Girls’ Parties\n\nAnother complaint — for which there was no contact information provided — alleged that “calendar girls” parties at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago involved genital measurements for children.\n\n“Jeffrey Epstein would bring the children in and trump would auction them off. He measured the children’s vulva and vaginas by entering a finger and rated the children on tightness,” the complaint reads.\n\nThe person alleged people like Elon Musk, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump were present at these alleged parties.\n\nRobin Leach and Trump’s Head of Security\n\nOne complainant claimed they witnessed a “sex trafficking ring at the Trump Golf Course” in Rancho Palo Verdes, California between 1995 and 1996. The person alleged Ghislaine Maxwell, a former Epstein associate now serving 20 years for sex trafficking, was a “madam” and “broker” for deals involving girls.\n\nThe person claimed they witnessed Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous host Robin Leach “strangle a young girl” at a party. The person also alleged a threat from Trump’s head of security if she “ever talked.” She claimed she was told she would “end up as fertilizer for the back nine holes like the other c*nts” if she spoke about what she had seen.\n\nEpstein Gives Bill Gates Advice on Hiding Alleged STD From Wife\n\nAlso a part of the new file dump is a draft email Epstein was writing to himself in July 2013. In it, he addressed Bill Gates, accusing him of recently disregarding their “friendship.” In the lengthy message, he also made mention of Gates allegedly asking him to delete some past communications.\n\n“TO add insult to the injury you them (sic) implore me to please delete the emails regarding your std, your request that I provide you antibiotics that you can surreptitiously give to Melinda and the description of your penis,” he wrote.\n\nCheck out the Epstein files released so far here.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the latest changes to the available Epstein files.\n\nThe post DOJ Removes New Epstein Files That Mention Wild Trump Sex Allegations, Including Rape first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING (AP) — U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in the Chinese financial center of Shanghai on Friday in his bid to boost business opportunities for British firms in the world's second-largest economy, just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible opposition to any deal between Beijing and London.\n\nWhy are foreign leaders increasing visits to Beijing?\n\nWhat agreement was reached on British lawmakers sanctions?\n\nWhat business opportunities is Starmer seeking in China?\n\nHow did Trump respond to UK-China negotiations?\n\nStarmer, the center-left Labour leader, has brought more than 50 business leaders on his trip to China, the first by a U.K. prime minister in eight years.\n\nStarmer suggested Trump’s criticism was aimed more at Canada than Britain. He added that Washington was aware in advance of his trip and its objectives and pointed out that Trump has said he plans to visit China this spring.\n\n“I don’t think it’s wise for the United Kingdom to stick its head in the sand,” Starmer told Sky News. “China is the second biggest economy in the world. Along with Hong Kong, it’s our third-biggest trading partner. And through this visit, we’ve opened up lots of opportunities for jobs and wealth creation.”\n\nStarmer started his trip in Beijing on Thursday, where he met with Chinese leaders including Xi Jinping. The two pledged to pursue a long-term and stable strategic partnership in what was seen as a sign of improving ties after several years of friction between the two countries.\n\nIn Washington, Trump suggested that he may oppose any deal between Beijing and London, and then pivoted to Canada, with which he has had a series of sharp exchanges since Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited China earlier this month.\n\n“Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that,” he said, when asked about Starmer’s visit and any U.K. trade talks with Beijing. “And it’s even more dangerous, I think, for Canada to get into business with China. Canada is not doing well. They’re doing very poorly.”\n\n“You can’t look at China as the answer,” he said.\n\nStarmer and Carney are among a series of foreign leaders to visit Beijing as their nations seek to improve ties with China. Many have seen their countries’ economies buffeted by Trump’s tariffs and are looking to expand other export markets.\n\nThe British prime minister said Xi agreed to remove a travel ban that had been imposed on several British lawmakers after the U.K.'s former center-right Conservative government joined the European Union, Canada and the U.S. in imposing sanctions on four Chinese officials over evidence of rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim people in the far western Xinjiang region.\n\n“This has been a cause of concern in Parliament and for parliamentarians for some time and that is why I raised it on this visit,\" Starmer told ITV News. “The response from the Chinese is that the restrictions no longer apply and President Xi has told me that that means that all parliamentarians are welcome to visit.”",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The terms of a Russian commitment to U.S. President Donald Trump to temporarily halt its bombardment of Ukraine during one of the country's bleakest winters in years remained unclear Friday, as Ukrainians braced for even worse conditions to come next week.\n\nTrump said late Thursday that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a temporary pause in targeting Kyiv and other places as the region experiences freezing temperatures that have brought widespread hardship to civilians.\n\n“I personally asked President Putin not to fire on Kyiv and the cities and towns for a week during this ... extraordinary cold,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. Putin has “agreed to that,” he said, without elaborating on when the request to the Russian leader was made.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a query seeking clarity about the scope and timing of any limited pause.\n\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed Friday that Trump “made a personal request” to Putin to stop targeting Kyiv until Feb. 1 “in order to create favorable conditions for negotiations.”\n\nThe mention of Feb. 1 was confusing since that is only two days away. Also, the cold weather is forecast to get much worse from Sunday, with temperatures dropping even further and making the time frame for a pause in attacks hard to understand.\n\nRussia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat, light and running water over the course of the war, in a strategy that Ukrainian officials describe as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nAsked if Moscow agreed to Trump’s proposal, Peskov said, “Yes, of course.” But he refused to answer further questions about whether the agreement covered only energy infrastructure or all aerial strikes, and when the halt on strikes was supposed to start.\n\nRussia struck Ukrainian energy assets in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday but there were no strikes on those facilities overnight, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday.\n\nIn a post on social media, Zelenskyy also noted that Russia has turned its attention to targeting Ukrainian logistics networks and that Russian drones and missiles hit residential areas of Ukraine overnight, as they have most nights during the war.\n\nTrump framed Putin's acceptance as a concession. But Zelenskyy was skeptical as Russia’s invasion approaches its fourth anniversary on Feb. 24 with no sign that Moscow is willing to reach a peace settlement despite a U.S.-led push to end the fighting.\n\n“I do not believe that Russia wants to end the war. There is a great deal of evidence to the contrary,” Zelenskyy said Thursday. Ukraine is ready to halt its attacks on Russia’s energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, if Moscow also stops its bombardment of the Ukrainian power grid and other energy assets, he said.\n\nRussia fired 111 drones and one ballistic missile at Ukraine overnight, injuring at least three people, the Ukrainian Air Force said.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said that its air defenses overnight shot down 18 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, as well as the illegally annexed Crimea and the Black Sea.\n\nForecasters say Kyiv, which recently endured severe power shortages, will see a brutally cold stretch starting Friday that is expected to last into next week. Temperatures in some areas will drop to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), the State Emergency Service said.\n\nThe possibility of a respite in energy sector attacks was discussed at last weekend’s meeting in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, between envoys of Ukraine, Russia and the United States, Zelenskyy said, adding that he had agreed to adhere to a “reciprocal approach” on energy assaults.\n\n“If Russia does not strike us, we will … take corresponding steps,” he told reporters.\n\nFurther talks were expected on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, but that could change because of a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran.\n\nIt was unclear whether and how any partial truce might work amid ongoing wider fighting and mistrust between the two countries.\n\n“There is no ceasefire. There is no official agreement on a ceasefire, as is typically reached during negotiations,” Zelenskyy said. “There has been no direct dialogue and no direct agreements on this matter between us and Russia.”\n\nUkraine had originally proposed a limited energy ceasefire at talks in Saudi Arabia last year, Zelenskyy said, but it gained no traction.\n\nDisagreement over what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory, and Moscow’s demand for possession of territory it hasn’t captured, are a key issue holding up a peace deal, according to Zelenskyy.\n\n“We have repeatedly said that we are ready for compromises that lead to a real end to the war, but that are in no way related to changes to Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” Zelenskyy said. “The American side understands this and says that there is a compromise solution regarding a free economic zone.”\n\nUkraine demands control over such a zone, he said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "It's been more than a decade since Brett Ratner directed a major motion picture, and nearly a decade since six women accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nNow he appears to be staging a comeback with a little help from President Donald Trump.\n\nRatner directed the authorized documentary about first lady Melania Trump, which premiered in theaters on Friday.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that the director is also working on a docuseries about the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements to normalize relations between Israel and some Arab countries that were mediated by the US during Trump's first term.\n\n\"Melania\" is getting a limited theatrical run before it begins streaming on Amazon, which paid $40 million to license the film.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work beside you during this past year,\" Ratner wrote of Melania in an Instagram post. \"I look forward to showing the world what an incredible First Lady you are!\"\n\nRatner's return comes after he stepped back from the public eye around 2017, when he faced sexual misconduct and harassment accusations at the height of the #MeToo era.\n\nHere's a look at the rise, fall, and return of Ratner's career.\n\nRatner is a Miami Beach-native who broke into the entertainment industry in the 1990s. Ratner made his directorial debut in 1997 with \"Money Talks,\" an action-comedy starring Chris Tucker and Charlie Sheen.\n\nHe also directed music videos for artists such as Madonna, Mariah Carey, D'Angelo, and Heavy D.\n\nRatner struck gold when he directed \"Rush Hour,\" a buddy-cop film starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker that hit theaters in 1998.\n\nThe film became a box-office success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, according to the movie financial analysis site The Numbers.\n\nHe went on to direct other notable Hollywood projects, including \"Red Dragon,\" \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" and \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nRatner also has production credits to his name. During his career, he's produced shows like \"Prison Break\" and the 2011 film \"Horrible Bosses.\"\n\nRatner and Australian billionaire James Packer founded RatPac Entertainment in 2012. The company found early success when it financed \"Gravity,\" a 2013 sci-fi thriller starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock.\n\nIn addition to commercial and critical acclaim, \"Gravity\" won numerous awards, including seven Academy Awards, six BAFTA awards, and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nRatPac Entertainment cemented itself as a serious industry player in 2013 when it partnered with Dune Entertainment to secure a deal with Warner Bros. The deal involved RatPac Entertainment financing more than $1 billion for 75 movies, such as \"The Lego Movie\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"\n\nRatner snagged a role producing the 84th Academy Awards, but stepped down after using a homophobic slur during a press event for his film \"Tower Heist.\"\n\nHe apologized in a statement to outlets in 2011, saying, \"It was a dumb way of expressing myself. Everyone who knows me knows that I don't have a prejudiced bone in my body. But as a storyteller, I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.\"\n\nRatner accepted the Ally Award from GLAAD in 2013 for working on a pro-LGBTQ PSA campaign.\n\nSix women — including actor Olivia Munn — accused Ratner of sexual harassment or misconduct in a 2017 article with The Los Angeles Times.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner disputed the accusations at the time. He has never been charged with any crimes.\n\n\"I have represented Mr. Ratner for two decades, and no woman has ever made a claim against him for sexual misconduct or sexual harassment,\" the spokesperson said. \"Furthermore, no woman has ever requested or received any financial settlement from my client.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the accusations, in 2018, Warner Bros. chose not to renew its co-financing deal with RatPac Entertainment and Dune Entertainment.\n\nRatner stepped back from public life following the accusations. The last major motion picture he directed was \"Hercules,\" released in 2014, making \"Melania\" his largest project in over a decade.\n\nAmazon paid about $40 million to license the documentary, which will have a theatrical run before streaming on Prime Video. The deal also included a docuseries.\n\nMelania Trump, first lady of the United States, and President Donald Trump attended the film's world premiere in January.\n\nA spokesperson for Ratner told Business Insider that he's set to direct \"Rush Hour 4,\" which is in development.\n\nAlthough nearly a decade has passed since \"Rush Hour 3\" debuted in theaters, the franchise's revival may — in part — be the work of Trump.\n\nSemafor reported that Trump \"personally\" urged Paramount's owner to revive the \"Rush Hour\" series for new audiences.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman warns that Trump's trade policies are a threat to the US economy.\n\nTrump's tactics are leading to strained relations with trade partners, Krugman says.\n\nHe predicts a \"divorce\" between the US and major trading partners.\n\nPaul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "title": "King Charles Is Reportedly 'Horrified' By Prince Harry's Response To Donald Trump's Claims 'Insulting' And 'Appalling' Comments About UK Soldiers 'Staying Back' During War In Afghanistan: This Isn't 'Podcast Politics'",
    "description": "Find out more about King Charles' reaction to Prince Harry calling out Donald Trump following his claims about NATO allies on SheFinds.com",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump recently made claims that British soldiers stayed “off the front lines” during the war in Afghanistan, and his comments struck a chord, especially with Prince Harry, who served for over a decade in the British Army. The 41-year-old didn’t waste any time calling out the United States president, but his father, King Charles, reportedly wishes his son reacted differently. Keep reading \n\nAccording to Royal reporter Rob Shuter, Harry's very public reaction to Donald Trump's claims has put King Charles in a \"deeply uncomfortable\" position, especially ahead of King Charles and Queen Camilla's upcoming trip to the United States. Shuter reported that Charles \"understands the emotion, but he's horrified by the timing.\"\n\n\"This is diplomacy—not podcast politics,\" an insider told Shuter. \"Harry's comments make an already sensitive situation far trickier. The King can't clap back—even if he agrees.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News last week, Donald Trump questioned if the NATO allies would \"be there\" if the United States \"ever needed them.\"\n\n\"I've always said, 'Will they be there, if we ever needed them?' And that's really the ultimate test. And I'm not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there, but will they be there?\" he questioned.\n\n\"We've never needed them,\" he continued. \"We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did—they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"\n\nThese claims from Donald Trump angered many members of the NATO alliance, including England. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's claims \"insulting and frankly appalling,\" and even Prince Harry had more than a few words to say about it.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Prince Harry released a statement on the topic. \"In 2001, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first—and only—time in history,\" he said, referencing the mutual defense clause that was activated following the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"It meant that every allied nation was obliged to stand with the United States in Afghanistan, in pursuit of our shared security. Allies answered that call.\"\n\n\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,\" he continued. \"The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed. Thousands of lives were changed forever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.\"\n\n\"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect, as we all remain united and loyal to the defense of diplomacy and peace,\" he finished. Prince Harry has long since been a supporter and defender of British veterans, having founded the Invictus Games in 2014, an international, Paralympic-style event for wounded, injured, and sick military service personnel and veterans.",

    "title": "The Trump Administration Arrested Don Lemon Like He Was a Fugitive Slave",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "Lemon’s arrest is not only a clear violation of the First Amendment but also a blatant throwback to the Constitution’s long-discarded Fugitive Slave Clause.\n\nThe Department of Justice arrested two journalists, Don Lemon, and Georgia Fort, in connection with their coverage of a protest that took place inside a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 18. The DOJ also arrested two activists, Trahern Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy, for their role in the protest. All four of the people arrested are Black.\n\nThe arrests of the two journalists are clearly unconstitutional. You don’t need to be a legal scholar to know that arresting journalists for covering the news is a clear violation of the First Amendment. Lemon’s arrest is also flatly illegal. Last week, the Trump administration went to a federal magistrate judge, Douglas L. Micko, to ask for an arrest warrant for Lemon. The judge refused. The Trump administration then appealed and lost that appeal. The legal system literally said the government couldn’t arrest Lemon, but the government arrested him anyway, and they went all the way to Los Angeles (far from Minnesota) to get him.\n\nGeorgia Fort is a prominent Black journalist based in Minnesota. She was out front in covering the George Floyd protests, and expertly covered the trial of his killer, Derek Chauvin. I have little doubt that this prior reporting is among the reasons she was targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nI know less about the activists: Crews is a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, while Lundy works in the Hennepin County Attorney’s office and recently announced his candidacy for the Minnesota state Senate. I also know that arresting people for protesting is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nIn her tweet proclaiming the arrests, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the four were arrested “at my direction.” Later reports suggested that the DOJ empaneled a federal grand jury that issued the arrest warrants for Lemon and Fort, but didn’t explain the cause for arresting Crews and Lundy. Going to a grand jury to get an arrest warrant that a judge and appeals court previously denied on constitutional grounds is highly unusual in a democracy, but I guess it’s how the fascists play the game.\n\nI expect, at a minimum, that the arrests of Lemon and Fort will be thrown out in court eventually, since at least one of them already has been. I think the more important question is why all four of these Black people were arrested. To answer that question, we should start with the White House’s official tweet about Lemon’s arrest. They tweeted out: “When life gives you lemons…” followed by a chain emoji. This ties the arrest of Lemon to this country’s history of slavery in a way no sane person will miss.\n\nThe arrest of Lemon harks back to a discarded portion of our original Constitution: the Fugitive Slave Clause. That clause read: “No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.” It’s relevant because the Fugitive Slave Clause counteracted a different amendment in the Constitution, the 10th, which explicitly reserves all “police power” to the states.\n\nTo put it simply, the 10th Amendment says that states are in charge of deciding whom they need to arrest, but the Fugitive Slave Clause says the federal government can violate the 10th Amendment—if they need to capture Black people. Fundamentally, that is what’s happened to Lemon. The federal government has superseded the constitutional authority of Minnesota so that it can arrest a Black man who got away. And we know that’s how they’re thinking, because they’re using literal chain emojis to congratulate themselves on their accomplishment.\n\nWhat we’re seeing is an obvious attempt to change the face of the victims of Trump’s fascism. I believe the Trump administration always assumed that the people on the front lines of the resistance to their tactics would be Black and brown. They assumed that the people who would be getting brutalized in the streets and shot and killed would be people of color. They did not assume that the victim of their brutality would be a white man who was a nurse for veterans. They did not assume it would be a white woman with children’s plushies in her glove compartment.\n\nArresting Black journalists and activists, and using explicit slavery imagery while doing it, is an attempt to inflame the Black community and remind white folks who the real targets are. Support for ICE and the Trump administration generally is falling among white folks. Trump wants to remind those white folks that he’s really just trying to arrest dangerous Black people.\n\nTrump and Steven Miller want a race war. They think they’ll win it. They think white people will tune in for it. Their operating theory is that most white people are viciously racist, like they are, and that most whites secretly pine to live in apartheid South Africa.\n\nI don’t think they’re right—and I say that as a person who is not known to have a particularly high opinion of the moral clarity of white Americans. My read has always been that most white people in this country are like most people who eat meat in this country: they want to enjoy a good steak, but they don’t want to go to a slaughterhouse and put a bolt gun in a cow. White people enjoy their privilege, but they don’t exactly want to see how their privilege gets made.\n\nArresting a journalist like Lemon—who is not only “Black famous” like Fort is but crossover famous among white folks—is as likely to inflame the white community as it is to inflame the Black community. Lemon got arrested last night while covering the Grammys, of all things, not the Image Awards.\n\nThe arrests of the journalists cannot hold up legally. (The arrests of the activists shouldn’t hold up legally either, as Bondi is claiming the activist violated the First Amendment rights of churchgoers while Bondi is violating the First Amendment rights of protesters.) It is a shredding of the First Amendment that I don’t think even Trump’s plants on the Supreme Court can stand for (except for Clarence Thomas, who is probably titillated about the opportunity to use the Fugitive Slave Clause as the basis for his dissenting opinion from the more sane members of the court). I also don’t think the arrests will hold up socially. I don’t think they will change the narrative in the way Trump and Miller probably hope it will.\n\nOf course, the road to bad takes is paved with a reliance on white people to do the right thing. I don’t think this will work, legally or culturally, but I’ll need white people to prove me right.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's monthslong and contentious search for a new commissioner to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics may be ending.\n\nOn a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump announced that he intends to nominate Brett Matsumoto, a longtime agency economist, to lead the BLS.\n\nThe BLS commissioner role has been vacant since August, when Trump fired Erika McEntarfer after the release of a jobs report showing weak employment growth. Trump alleged, without providing evidence, that the data had been politically manipulated. The allegation and removal have since undermined public trust in one of the federal government's most closely watched statistical agencies, which is supposed to remain nonpartisan.\n\nThe agency has roughly 2,000 employees, and the commissioner is its only appointed position. The commissioner's role carries a four-year term and requires Senate confirmation.\n\nBefore Matsumoto, the White House previously nominated EJ Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist, for the job, but later withdrew the nomination after it became clear Antoni lacked sufficient support for Senate confirmation.\n\nMatsumoto is a career economist with deep ties to the agency he would lead if confirmed.\n\nBased on Matsumoto's LinkedIn profile, he earned undergraduate and master's degrees at the University of Delaware before earning his doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina in 2015. Since then, he has been working at the BLA as a supervisory research economist. Multiple academic papers under his name can be found covering issues such as consumer expenditure and inflation measurement. Over the past year, he has been on assignment at the Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMatsumoto is not very active on social media. A Facebook account under his name shows that his profile picture used to be a photo with Ivanka Trump back in August 2020. His most recent profile photo features him alongside a tabby cat.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social late Friday, Trump said he was confident Matsumoto had the expertise to \"QUICKLY fix the long history of issues at the BLS on behalf of the American People.\"\n\nSeveral economists posted online that they believe Matsumoto could be the right choice.\n\nClaudia Sahm, Chief Economist at New Century Advisors, posted on X that Matsumoto is an \"excellent choice\" for the commissioner position.\n\nSkanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, echoed the sentiment on X and said that Matsumoto is \"a very thoughtful person who understands the nuts and bolts of data measurement and estimation.\"",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A federal judge warned Justice Department lawyers on Friday that they were making “dangerous” and “horrifying” statements when they said the Trump Administration can decide what part of American history to display at National Park Service sites.\n\nThe sharp exchange erupted during a hearing in Philadelphia over the abrupt removal of an exhibit on the history of slavery at the site of the former President’s House on Independence Mall.\n\nThe city, which worked in tandem with the park service on the exhibit two decades ago, was stunned to find workers this month using crowbars to remove outdoor plaques, panels and other materials that told the stories of the nine people who had been enslaved there. Some of the history had only been unearthed in the past quarter-century.\n\n“You can’t erase history once you’ve learned it. It doesn’t work that way,” said Senior U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nThe removal followed President Donald Trump’s executive order “restoring truth and sanity to American history” at the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks. In Philadelphia, the materials were put in a pickup truck and then into storage, leading Rufe to voice concerns about whether they were damaged.\n\n“Although many people feel strongly about this (exhibit) one way, other people may disagree or feel strongly another way,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory in den Berken.\n\n“Ultimately,” he said, “the government gets to choose the message it wants to convey.”\n\n“That is a dangerous statement you are making. It is horrifying to listen to,” she said. “It changes on the whims of someone in charge? I’m sorry, that is not what we elected anybody for.”\n\nRufe heard hours of testimony Friday from former city officials who had helped plan the exhibit, and said the city had kicked in $1.5 million toward the project. She plans to visit both the storage area and the site before ruling on the city’s request to have the exhibit restored. But she asked the Justice Department lawyers to ensure that nothing else is disturbed.\n\nIn den Berken said the Park Service routinely changes its exhibits and tours, and argued that the government cannot be forced to tell a certain story. But lawyers for the city and other advocates said the park service does not have “carte blanche” to interpret the nation’s history as it sees fit.\n\nThe exhibit includes biographical details about the nine people enslaved by George and Martha Washington at the presidential mansion. Now, only their names — Austin, Paris, Hercules, Christopher Sheels, Richmond, Giles, Oney Judge, Moll and Joe — remain engraved into a cement wall.\n\nMichael Coard, an attorney representing one of the advocacy groups supporting the exhibit, said the president was ignoring the power held by Congress, the judiciary and the American people.\n\n“It’s one thing to whisper that type of dictatorial power. But to send lawyers into a public courtroom to make that argument is absolutely frightening,” he said. “I'm really worried about the state of America.”\n\nRufe said she planned to rule quickly, noting the surge of visitors expected to visit the nation's birthplace this year to mark its 250th anniversary of being founded.\n\nResidents who have visited the site have shed tears, left flowers and left a handmade sign that said “Slavery was real.”",

    "description": "Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian aircraft has stirred safety concerns among analysts who caution against politicizing aircraft certification.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's threat to \"decertify\" Canadian-made aircraft — the backbone of many US carriers' regional jet fleet — is a threat to aviation safety, industry watchers said Friday.\n\nThe president also doesn't have the authority to unilaterally declare planes unworthy to fly in the US, Henry Harteveldt, an aviation industry authority and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told Business Insider. That authority belongs to the FAA.\n\nThe trade spat — another in a continuing back-and-forth between Trump and Canada — comes after Canada hasn't fully certified newer US-made Gulfstream jets to fly in its skies. (It has certified older models.) Gulfstream planes are used almost exclusively by private aviation companies, governments, and the ultrawealthy.\n\nTrump said on Thursday night, in a Truth Social post, that he would \"decertify\" Canada-made Bombardier jets until Canada approved the Gulfstream models. He also threatened a 50% tariff on \"any and all\" Canadian aircraft sold in the US until the situation was corrected.\n\nBombardier said in a statement that it's in contact with the Canadian government. The FAA referred Business Insider to the White House. A White House official said decertification would not immediately affect aircraft already in operation; it would apply only to new deliveries.\n\nThat would be a relief for US airlines like American, Delta, and United, whose regional affiliates operate Bombardier CRJ aircraft to cities across the country.\n\nStill, any move to decertify these more than 2,000 passenger airliners and private jets — part of almost 5,550 Canadian-made aircraft and helicopters certified in the US, according to Cirium — could trigger thousands of flight cancellations a day. A 50% tariff would likely raise airline ticket prices.\n\nAviation analysts said Trump's threat posed a safety risk in itself.\n\n\"Anything that intrudes on the turf of safety regulators coming from politics, trade issues, or personal grievances is a very, very bad idea,\" Richard Aboulafia, managing director of the aviation consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider.\n\nAboulafia said aircraft certification is intentionally non-political for a reason: Regulators are meant to evaluate risk, not respond to trade threats. Once certification becomes a political weapon, trust in the system erodes for manufacturers, operators, and the flying public, he contended.\n\nIn Canada's case, the delay in certification is likely not obstructionism but the result of independent regulatory decisions.\n\nFor the Gulfstream G700 and G800, Canada hasn't completed its own certification, while the FAA has granted Gulfstream a temporary exemption from certain fuel‑icing rules designed to ensure aircraft engines and systems operate safely in extreme cold.\n\nThe FAA waiver means Gulfstream has until the end of this year to meet those requirements — meaning the aircraft is operating under essentially conditional certification in the US, despite being allowed to be delivered.\n\nThese waivers are not unusual and are typically granted to allow new aircraft to enter service while completing certain technical tests and paperwork, rather than because the planes are unsafe.\n\nStill, history shows what can sometimes go wrong when thorough certification and safety protocols are deprioritized. The most consequential example was the Boeing 737 Max, which suffered two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 due to systemic design issues, killing 346 people.\n\nMore recently, in early 2024, a door plug separated on another 737 Max due to quality-control issues at Boeing's Washington factory, further exacerbating scrutiny of production and certification. No one died in that incident.\n\nPart of the reason the 737 Max issues slipped past regulators is that, for decades, global authorities often relied on reciprocal approvals, effectively rubber-stamping each other's certifications to speed aircraft to market.\n\nThe Max disasters exposed the risks of that approach. Today, regulators — including those in Canada — are expected to conduct their own full assessments rather than automatically rely on approvals from foreign authorities.\n\nThe FAA itself is taking extra precautions before certifying the Boeing 737 Max 7 and 10, as both aircraft have technical problems that could lead to engine overheating. Boeing initially asked for a waiver but rescinded it amid the scrutiny.",

    "title": "'Melania' isn't good. But it isn't for you, anyway.",
    "description": "Even diehard Trump fans might be bored by the documentary about the first lady. But this movie, \"Melania,\" is for an audience of one.",
    "fullText": "Let's get this out of the way: \"Melania,\" the new documentary about first lady Melania Trump, is not a good movie.\n\nI mean: It's possible you'll like it if you're a Trump superfan who likes everything Trump does.\n\nThe movie is full of drone shots and lingering looks in and outside of SUVs and private planes. There are lots of glimpses inside the White House, Trump Tower, and Mar-a-Lago. There's also some very expensive music licensing that brings you a sampling of artists you might hear at the beginning of a Trump rally, including the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, and Tears for Fears. (There's also a stirring rendition of \"Amazing Grace\" by Aretha Franklin that's the most moving thing in there, and jarring in context.)\n\nBut I think even director Brett Ratner knows he's made a dull, inert product, where zero interesting things happen. That is presumably why, halfway through the one-hour, 44-minute-long movie, he starts inserting grainy Super 8-style footage into the shots, simply to give the thing additional texture. Like crumbling some crackers on top of a sodden hot dish.\n\nThe best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed). It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\n\nBut that's just my opinion. What does someone who hasn't been reporting on the damage caused by Donald Trump's administration think?\n\n\"I think it's perfectly well made,\" says Jamal Caesar, who describes himself as a writer/director who is also a Melania fan. \"I think everyone, actually, will like this movie.\"\n\nI talked to Caesar on Friday afternoon, after watching a 10:30 am \"Melania\" screening near Union Square in Manhattan. My thought was that I could find other people there who weren't me to interview about the movie.\n\nAlas, 11 of the 14 other people in the theater were other journalists or their friends, doing what I was doing. One of the other three was a woman who said she liked someone involved in the movie, but didn't want me to identify her. \"Hell no. I'm not a Trumper.\" The two other men had told me before the movie started that they weren't journalists. They zipped out of the theater before I could ask them what they thought.\n\nSo, for the record: Caesar, who says he went to both Trump inaugurations, said he thinks the movie is particularly good at showing \"opulence — one of the things Trump and their family is most known for.\"\n\n\"Everyone is sort of interested in glamour, and that's what this brings to life,\" he added.\n\nWill other people actually watch, and/or like, this movie? We have no idea. We know that Amazon is spending a reported $75 million on production and marketing for \"Melania,\" and distributing it widely in theaters before it starts streaming on Amazon's Prime Video later this year. So everyone's going to get a chance to weigh in, one way or another.\n\nAnd it's the opposite of surprising that a morning Manhattan screening — on a very, very cold day — only brought a handful of ticket buyers/professional rubber-neckers. Puck's Matt Belloni says he's seen projections that show the viewership for this one — at least in theaters — will be roughly split between red and blue geographies. So we'll see.\n\nBut of course, the whole point of this movie isn't to generate big box-office numbers, or even to generate more Amazon Prime subscriptions.\n\nAmazon's spending on this documentary is so out of scale with any other doc that the only way to view it is as a gift from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to the Trump administration — one of the many, many donations American businessmen have made to the administration in the last year. (Amazon's stock line about this: \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\")\n\nSo the only real question for Bezos and Trump is: Was it worth it?",

    "fullText": "First lady Melania Trump is no stranger to cameras, but this time, she's the one calling the shots.\n\nHer new documentary, \"Melania: Twenty Days to History,\" provides a glimpse into her life and work during the 20 days leading up to President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. Released in theaters on Friday, the first lady served as both its star and producer.\n\n\"She's a very private and very selective person as to who she speaks to and what she does,\" Marc Beckman, Melania Trump's senior advisor and a producer of the film, told Business Insider. \"We thought that this would be the appropriate opportunity to share a little bit more, to open the lens a little bit more into her family life, her career, and her philanthropy, all as she becomes first lady of the United States of America again.\"\n\nBeckman said that the first lady was deeply involved in the film's creation.\n\n\"She participated not just with the creative direction, but in production and post-production,\" Beckman said. \"She was in the edit room. She was helping with color correction. She was very much involved with music selection — every song was selected by her.\"\n\nAfter its theatrical run, \"Melania\" will stream on Amazon, which paid $40 million for the film and a forthcoming docuseries set for release this summer.\n\nHere are the most surprising moments and revelations from the documentary.\n\nThe film opens with \"Billie Jean\" by Michael Jackson playing over aerial footage of Mar-a-Lago. The song reappears later as Melania Trump sings along while riding in the car and names it her favorite Michael Jackson hit.\n\n\"Melania\" follows Melania Trump as she divides her time between Trump Tower in New York City, Mar-a-Lago in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, DC.\n\nThe Florida estate holds special meaning for the first lady, who remembers it as the place \"where Baron took his swim lessons with his grandfather, played golf with his father, and took his first tennis lesson with me.\"\n\nCarter's funeral was held on January 9, 2025, one year to the day after the death of Melania Trump's mother, Amalija Knavs.\n\n\"Grief comes in waves when you lose someone who means so much to you. I will be sitting in the Washington Cathedral, paying respect to President Carter, but I know my beloved mother will be on my mind,\" she said in the film's voiceover.\n\nIn the film, Pierre said the seams on the dress were entirely hidden beneath the black band zigzagging across it.\n\n\"You don't give the recipe,\" he said. \"It's like a mystery.\"\n\nThe film showed a video call between Macron and Melania Trump, where they spoke about working together on her Fostering the Future and Be Best initiatives focused on children's well-being.\n\n\"My next step and my next goal is to foster relationships and work on it with like-minded leaders and establish a coalition,\" Melania Trump said. \"And when we do, I hope you will join me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure. I go everywhere with you,\" Macron said.\n\nIn the days leading up to her return to the White House, Melania Trump also recruited Queen Rania of Jordan for her coalition during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAviva Siegel was held for 51 days before being released on November 26, 2023, as part of a temporary ceasefire deal brokered by the Biden administration. In the documentary, Melania Trump comforted Siegel and pledged Donald Trump's support for releasing the remaining hostages, including Siegel's husband, Keith Siegel.\n\n\"I know that once he's commander in chief, I know that's his priority. I'm sure of it,\" Melania Trump said.\n\nOne of the final title cards of the film reads: \"Melania Trump played a key role in securing the release of Keith Siegel after 484 days as a hostage in Gaza, just 12 days after the inauguration.\"\n\nIn the documentary, Knavs was shown holding a handheld camcorder and filming his daughter in the background of public appearances.\n\n\"My father always filmed these special moments when I was a child,\" Melania Trump said in the film's voiceover narration. \"He showed me the world through his lens, the essence of living life with passion and purpose.\"\n\n\"Walking into the Capitol Rotunda, I felt the weight of history intertwined with my own journey as an immigrant — a reminder of why I respect this nation so deeply,\" she said in the film's narration. \"Everyone should do what they can to protect our individual rights. Never take them for granted because in the end, no matter where we come from, we are bound by the same humanity.\"\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady, Melania Trump has previously spoken about her \"arduous\" pathway to citizenship.\n\nThough the move was due to frigid temperatures in Washington, DC, on Inauguration Day, Melania Trump said she preferred an indoor space for security reasons after her husband survived an assassination attempt in July 2024.\n\n\"Being in a more secure and closed space brought a certain peace of mind,\" she said.\n\nIn a scene toward the end of the film, Donald Trump was shown practicing an inauguration speech as Melania Trump watched.\n\n\"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker,\" he said.\n\nHer addition made it into the final draft of Donald Trump's inauguration speech.\n\nMahaux, who has photographed the Trump family for over 20 years, describes Melania Trump as \"very reserved, but deeply intentional.\"\n\n\"I think what people don't always see in her is a curiosity that she has for the world,\" she told Business Insider. \"I think the documentary reflects her sense of duty, her discipline.\"\n\nMahaux also took Melania Trump's White House portrait during Donald Trump's first term in 2017.\n\n\"The first portrait was about discovering her new duty and her new role, and now this time, the portrait was an affirmation,\" Mahaux said. \"She really knew what she was. She was really embracing it and ready to get to work.\"",

    "title": "Want to Support the Fight Against Fascism? Boycott Trump’s World Cup",
    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "In this week’s Elie v. U.S., The Nation’s Justice correspondent urges soccer lovers to stay away, takes on the attacks on Alex Pretti, and warns of a dangerous anti-voting bill.\n\nPeople are finally beginning to call for other countries to boycott Donald Trump’s upcoming World Cup—and not just usual suspects like me and The Nation’s Dave Zirin. Oke Göttlich, a powerful German soccer administrator, said that, in the wake of the execution of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, the time has come to talk seriously about boycotting the tournament. Sepp Blatter, the former head of FIFA (the international governing committee of global soccer) suggested that fans shouldn’t travel to the tournament because of rising safety concerns in the United States.\n\nThis is going to sound weird to non–sports fans, but boycotting the World Cup is one of the most significant sanctions members of the international community can take against the United States right now. The World Cup is the most watched sporting event in the world. The US has been begging to host a tournament for decades. This World Cup, which runs from early June through mid-July, is a perfect opportunity for the world to stand against this country’s fascist regime.\n\nIndeed, the fates have aligned to make this World Cup the perfect one to make a statement—for two reasons. The first is that more countries are involved: The tournament has expanded to 48 teams this year, up from 32 in previous years, which means that more people than ever will be involved in the proceedings—and possible protests. The second reason is that those 48 countries wouldn’t actually have to boycott the entire World Cup, because this year’s tournament is also being hosted by two other countries—Canada and Mexico. Teams could refuse to play in the US while happily playing in Canada or Mexico. It would be a powerful statement.\n\nThat statement won’t come from FIFA, however. FIFA is one of the most corrupt organizations in the entire world, and its current president, Gianni Infantino, was last seen licking Trump’s boots and handing him a “peace prize.” Nor is it likely to come from the powerful soccer-playing countries in Western Europe. If France, Germany, and Great Britain were to pull out of the US portions of the tournament, many other countries would follow—but, sadly, the leaders of those nations appear eager to play Neville Chamberlain to Trump’s Hitler.\n\nTeams from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia could take a moral stand, but there are complications. Some of the teams involved are also run by repressive authoritarians. Others are financially dependent on FIFA and the World Cup to fund their soccer federations, while still others have entire economies beholden to the United States. On the other hand, a lot of those countries damn well know that if they did what the US is doing, they’d be boycotted and sanctioned and probably invaded by white people promising to restore “freedom” in exchange for all their oil and minerals. So it’s at least possible that some of them could take a moral stand. South Africa is in the tournament, and South Africa knows how to handle white people like Elon Musk.\n\nA boycott by all or some of the South American teams would make the whole tournament a joke. We know that the defending World Cup champion, Argentina, with its fascist-curious Trump-puppet president will show up (as will Ecuador, whose president is also friendly with our reigning despot), but some of the other nations that made the field—Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay—could be a different story. Their fans arguably face a real risk if they attend the matches. Could an American fan of, say, Colombia even go to a game without fear of being detained and deported by ICE, regardless of their actual citizenship status? Would a fan of Brazil feel safe traveling to the United States? The US is a clear and present danger to those people. If these soccer federations think about their fans, and the fact that their fans could be targeted by racist DHS agents, they might be convinced to do the right thing and boycott the US portions of the tournament.\n\nThe United States is an international pariah. It should be treated like one. Boycotting the World Cup is the obvious place to start.\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Ho Chi Minh\n\nThe New York Times released a video that purports to show an altercation between ICE and Alex Pretti a week before his murder. The video shows Pretti smashing the taillight of an ICE vehicle before the agents beat him up.\n\nThe Times (and right-wing cultists) seems to think this video proves that Pretti was a violent man who deserved to be executed without trial. Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, who wrote the story for the Times, played the role of ICE water-carrier when he wrote, “The footage adds to what is known about the 37-year-old nurse.”\n\nNo, you fascist-sympathizing fuck, the footage adds to what we know about ICE. In a court of law, that footage could be evidence of the motive behind ICE’s murder of that man. It could be evidence of premeditation. It potentially shows that Pretti was targeted by ICE for retribution and death. If federal agents had a preexisting “beef” with Pretti, if Pretti were known to people in the field and then they killed him, that’s compelling evidence that the killing was intentional.\n\nIt is common in our media to prosecute the victim. That’s what the Times (and Fox and the whole right-wing media echosphere) is trying to do now. But the people who should be on trial here are ICE. You show me a video where violent individuals had a prior altercation with a man, and then days later that man ends up getting shot in the back of the head, and I’m going to tell you that video is evidence of premeditated murder in the first degree.\n\nPerhaps I should tell The New York Times “thank you.” In their effort to smear Pretti, they may have just aggravated the charges against his murderers.\n\nI wrote about how Trump flinched in Minnesota, and that shows that the people are more powerful than the law or the opposition party ever will be.\n\nIn News Unrelated to the Current Chaos\n\nLet me be clear, I do not want another social media platform. I can’t handle it. You young people have no idea how hard it is to keep switching up platforms. I’m old, so very old. I can barely frost the thermoplastic polyurethane on my screen protector.\n\nThat said, I will probably UpScrolled is the new competitor to TikTok that has been surging in popularity since TikTok’s US operations were formally taken over by Trump-adjacent business interests this week. It was created by Issam Hijazi, whom Al Jazeera describes as a “Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian entrepreneur.” That’s a pretty big demographic contrast to Larry Ellison, the Benjamin Netanyahu buddy (and, you know, founder of Oracle and one of the three richest people alive) who acquired a large stake in TikTok once it was forced into US hands.\n\nTikTok users are (rightly) worried about censorship on the new TikTok, and a silencing of any views that don’t support fascism and genocide. It’s a valid concern, considering what Elon Musk has done to Twitter. UpScrolled is to TikTok as BlueSky is to Twitter, or so the story goes.\n\nSo I’ll probably join. But I really don’t want to. I don’t want to join anything else. Goddamnit, I miss my Tumblr account.\n\nIf you enjoyed this installment of Elie v. U.S.,",

    "description": "The race is set for August, leaving a tight timeline for the ambitious program to come together.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the president has signed an executive order directing the creation of an IndyCar race on Washington D.C.'s Capitol Mall. The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "fullText": "More than 10 years after its delivery, warnings from Donald Trump’s June 2015 presidential candidacy announcement continue to resonate. He decried the high cost of the Affordable Care Act medical insurance subsidies. He sounded a warning about the federal debt, then at $18 trillion, calling $24 trillion in debt the point of no return.\n\nAbout 15 months later, beginning with speeches in October 2016, he added a third dire warning about Washington’s entrenched bureaucracy. His call for a Constitutional amendment for term limits on Congress, and his phrase “drain the swamp,” drew huge positive reaction to crowds attending campaign rallies.\n\nAs this month ends, a cataclysmic controversy over the Dept. of Homeland Security threatens another partial government shutdown. The federal debt sits at more than $38.5 trillion. Despite the efforts of DOGE and actions which have dismantled some parts of government, such as the Department of Education — entrenched bureaucrats still hold massive power in and around the Beltway.\n\nAnother paralyzing problem is the vexing overreach of the judiciary. According to the non-profit Lawfare, there are now 253 active court cases challenging Trump’s administration actions as president. And although Supreme Court rulings have frequently favored Trump, liberal judges continue handing down injunctions to block his executive policies and orders.\n\nAdd to this an unprecedented degree of uncertainty about the 2026 midterm elections. More than 50 frustrated Senators and Congressmen, many of them Republicans, are choosing not to seek re-election. Most recent polling gives Democrats a 5-point advantage in the coming midterms, and the party occupying the White House historically loses 20 to 25 Congressional seats in the midterm terms.\n\nIf Democrats win back the House, another Trump impeachment is likely. The political landscape in 2027 and 2028 could become far more murky and less favorable to Trump than it is now.\n\nBut there is one way that Trump could do an end-around on all this and provide the nation a huge, maybe even transformational benefit in the process. Staying true to his roots and his campaign rhetoric dating back to 2015, Trump could announce in 2026 that he is now advocating for a convention of states under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, to adopt changes in how Washington works.\n\nSpecifically, he’d seek congressional term limits (something 87 percent of the public supports), a balanced budget amendment (something 49 of our 50 states already have), and limitations on the power of the judiciary.\n\nAll three of these are perfectly consistent with what Trump believes and has campaigned upon ever since he first tossed his hat into the presidential ring 11 years ago.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, Trump’s involvement could ensure success of the movement working toward holding such a convention of states. Under Article V, the legislatures of 34 states must pass resolutions in order to hold it. There are 20 states which have already agreed to the measure. Trump carried 31 states in the 2024 presidential election. Of these, 17 have not yet approved the resolution.\n\nIf Trump backs the measure and campaigns for an Article V convention, many of these 17 states would certainly get on board.\n\nTrump’s involvement would also ensure success due to one other factor: growing public disenchantment with the status quo. About 80 percent of Americans feel the nation is in a political crisis. The current upheaval over internal immigration enforcement and campaigning in the midterms will only serve to exacerbate that sentiment.\n\nThe best legacy Trump can leave America on its 250th anniversary is to reform the status quo once and for all. And the only way to achieve that is through the Convention of States process.\n\nJohn Kerezy is an associate professor at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland.",

    "fullText": "A law enforcement agency executing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has been described as a serial violator of court orders in Minnesota.\n\nThe declaration didn't come from the Democratic governor or Minneapolis' Democratic mayor, who have repeatedly traded barbs with President Donald Trump. It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "description": "Gold and silver plunged on Friday as traders reacted to Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed chair. The dollar jumped and the debasement trade took a hit.",
    "fullText": "The rally pushing gold and silver to new records finally stumbled on Friday as markets reacted to Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Reserve.\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed Governor, will replace Jerome Powell this year if confirmed by the Senate. The news sent metals tumbling on Friday as investors repriced their outlook for monetary policy and the so-called debasement trade that's helped gold'd record-setting rally took a hit.\n\nGold, which is still up more than 70% in the last year, dropped 7% to trade around $5,000 an ounce. It had briefly dipped below $5,000 before paring losses.\n\nSilver, which has roared more than 200% higher in the last year, plunged as much as 15% to trade around $99 an ounce.\n\nMarkets have been worried for months about Trump's Fed pick, as it was believed that Trump would plug in a new Fed chief to aggressively lower interest rates and help his big affordability push.\n\nThat's pushed down the value of the US dollar, one trend that's made precious metals more attractive over the past year.\n\nBut Warsh, who moved to the front of the line in Trump's Fed Chair search in recent weeks, is considered more hawkish and likely to preserve the Fed's independence.\n\nThat last point—that Trump could use his nominee to wrest control of the central bank—has been a big driver of the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and hurt the dollar over the last year.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which has declined 11% in 12 months, spiked shortly after Trump announced his Fed Chair pick on Truth Social, climbing 0.5% Friday morning.\n\nThe dollar's surge appeared to jump-start the sell-off in metals, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You knew there was going to be some trigger that would cause a bit of a technical pullback,\" he said, adding that investors were eager to take profits after the parabolic move in metals over the last 12 months.\n\nJosé Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, described the sell-off in metals as a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to Trump's Fed Chair pick. It's also natural for metals to pull back given the significant move to the upside in recent months, much of which was fueled by hype and speculation, he said.\n\n\"What President Trump wants is a dove. However, Warsh historically is an inflation hawk. I think there's a lot of confusion going on right now in terms of what kind of Warsh we're going to get at the Fed,\" he told Business Insider, pointing to the move in the dollar and precious metals.\n\n\"Okay, maybe the central bank is not going to be as loose as it might have been under perhaps Kevin Hassett,\" he added of the market's thinking.\n\nDavid Rosenberg, an economist and the founder of Rosenberg Research, noted that Warsh's nomination could have caused some investors to reverse course on the debasement trade, in which investors scoop up hard assets like gold and silver out of concern that the US dollar is at risk from macro forces including higher inflation, chaotic trade policy, and a politicized central bank.\n\n\"The market reaction so far points to 'less dovish' and more 'orthodox expectations, with independence fears easing at the margin. There is some unwinding in the so-called debasement trade,\" Rosenberg wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nHogan said it was too early to tell whether the debasement trade was truly unwinding, though the reaction on Friday suggested some investors were moving in that direction.\n\n\"It's understandable that you're going to get a pretty abrupt reaction when the pressures turn around,\" he said of the move, speculating that metals could drop further.",

A thin red belt cinched at the waist for a pop of color.\n\nThe dress felt high-fashion, connecting the first lady to her past as a model as she stepped into a new role.\n\nIn August 2017, the Trumps visited Corpus Christi, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey to assess recovery efforts.\n\nThe pair wore casual attire, with Melania arriving in a white button-down, black jeans, and sneakers. She also added a black baseball hat to her look that said \"FLOTUS,\" first lady of the United States, on the front.\n\nMelania's outfit quickly became a source of social-media chatter. Some said her hat called attention to her in the wake of the natural disaster, while others praised her casual outfit.\n\nWhen greeting Justin and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at the White House in October 2017, Melania wore a gray pinstripe suit instead of a dress.\n\nThe suit featured high-waisted pants, and she paired it with a white button-down and an untied black tie. The outfit was unexpected for a first lady, offering a fun style moment.\n\nMelania greeted President Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, in a black minidress and black pumps at the White House.\n\nThe standout feature of her outfit was a Givenchy tuxedo cape, which added a flair of personality to the otherwise simple look.\n\nThe first lady changed into a silver Chanel dress for the dinner.\n\nMost of the form-fitting dress was covered in textured fabric, while the top of the bodice and bottom of the skirt were made of a sheer, black fabric adorned with silver embellishments.\n\nThe fabrics didn't blend well, making the dress look too busy. It would have been a better look without the sheer fabric.\n\nIn June 2018, Melania visited an immigration facility in McAllen, Texas, where children were living, wearing a green Zara jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nCritics said the jacket was insensitive to wear for the visit, critiquing both the first lady and the president for the fashion faux pas.\n\nMelania's former aide, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" that the president yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though Trump and the first lady both said she wore it to send a message to the left-wing media.\n\nMelania wore a floor-length wrap dress from Ralph Lauren to celebrate Independence Day 2018.\n\nThe blue-and-white gingham dress was fun and festive for the holiday, but the oversize red belt tied at her waist overwhelmed the look.\n\nIf the first lady had swapped the bow for a thinner belt, her dress would have been more effective.\n\nMelania posed for photos in front of pyramids in Egypt wearing cream trousers, a white blouse, a black tie, and a sand-colored Ralph Lauren blazer. A white-and-black boater hat completed the look.\n\nThe outfit may have been innocuously stylish in a different venue, but some social-media users thought the outfit looked similar to one worn by \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" villain René Belloq during his visit to the pyramids in the film.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Melania faced criticism for one of her outfits on her visit to Africa. During her tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Melania told reporters, \"I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" following backlash for wearing a white pith helmet.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip,\" she added. \"We went to Ghana, we went to Malawi, we went to Kenya, here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip, not what I wear.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump arrived at the White House on the evening of December 27, holding hands as they walked across the lawn.\n\nWhile the president was in a suit, Melania wore a green jacket, light-brown pants, and matching shoes.\n\nThe pants might have been a better choice for a daytime look, as it was difficult for some to tell if the first lady was even wearing bottoms at first glance in the dark. The addition of sunglasses to her nighttime look was also an odd choice.\n\nMelania's outfit would have worked better during the day or with different pants.\n\nIn April 2019, the first lady was photographed at the White House in a black-and-white polka-dot dress designed by Alessandra Rich.\n\nThe high-neck dress was cinched at the waist with a black belt, coordinating with the dots on the dress, and it hit her mid-calf.\n\nMelania wore a cream coat over her shoulders and her signature sunglasses, adding glamour to the feminine look.\n\nDuring a visit to the UK, Melania attended a state dinner with the royal family in a Dior gown.\n\nA layer of semi-sheer fabric covered the gown's scooped neckline, forming points on the top of the bodice before transitioning into white fabric. The dress hugged her figure before flaring slightly at her waist.\n\nMelania wore white, elbow-length gloves with the dress. The look was fitting for dining with royalty.\n\nAhead of a dinner at Winfield House, where the American ambassador to the UK lives, Melania was photographed in a red Givenchy gown.\n\nMelania's floor-length dress was sleeveless and featured a built-in cape, a silhouette Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, often favors.\n\nDuring another visit to the UK in December 2019, Melania stepped out in a high-neck, cape coat from Valentino. The coat was mustard yellow, and Melania paired it with a pink dress and coordinating pumps.\n\nThe jacket was a big statement in and of itself, so the look would have been more effective if the first lady had worn a more neutral color with it than bright pink.\n\nMelania's black Dior sundress was fairly simple. The midi-length dress featured a V-neckline and a white, dotted pattern.\n\nThe white lace belt from Alaïa and white Christian Louboutin pumps she wore with the dress made the look cohesive, and she also added sunglasses to the outfit.\n\nThe look balanced Melania's personal style and traditional first lady attire.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump in a hot-pink midi-dress from Jason Wu at the 2020 RNC.\n\nThe dress featured a boat neckline and a flared skirt, and two black bows sat on the waistline, which appeared to be cinched with elastic. Melania wore black pumps with the dress.\n\nThe bows on the dress could have been chic, but they looked a bit crumpled throughout the night, particularly because they sat atop the ruched waistline and contrasted so heavily with the pink fabric. The dress would have been a better fit if there had been just one or no bows on the waistline.\n\nMelania wore a cape dress to close out the RNC, choosing a neon-green piece from Valentino.\n\nThe ankle-length, high-neck dress was covered in vertical pleats and featured two swaths of fabric flowing out from her shoulders like a cape. She added a thin pink belt and pink pumps to the outfit.\n\nThe silhouette was beautiful, but the green color was an odd choice for the RNC. Vanity Fair reported that it allowed social-media users to easily make memes out of the outfit using green screen technology.\n\nIf she had worn the dress in a different color, Melania's look would have been a slam dunk.\n\nMelania oversaw the delivery of the 2020 White House Christmas tree in a gingham coat from Balenciaga.\n\nThe loose-fitting coat featured an off-center line of buttons, and the collar formed a scarf that wrapped around one of Melania's shoulders. Quarter-length sleeves showed off the first lady's black gloves, just as the knee-length hem spotlighted her black boots from Alaïa.\n\nThe look was effortlessly chic.\n\nWhen Trump left office in January 2021, Melania chose to wear an all-black outfit.\n\nShe paired a form-fitting Dolce & Gabbana dress with a cropped Chanel coat, gloves, Christian Louboutin pumps, and dark sunglasses.\n\nThe look seemed to nod to Jackie Kennedy, just as her first outfit as first lady did. However, the darker hues spoke to the more somber tone of the day for the Trumps.\n\nMelania also made headlines for changing into a beachy dress before arriving at Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\n\nRather than wearing another pastel look to mark the beginning of her husband's second term as president, Melania donned navy and white for the 2025 inauguration.\n\nAdam Lippes designed her coat, which she paired with a white scarf, navy pumps, and a custom boater-style hat from Eric Javits. Boater hats are typically worn in summer, but the wool piece Melania wore offered a winter version.\n\nAlthough the hat got some negative attention online as people compared it to the one the Hamburglar or V in \"V For Vendetta\" wore, Melania's inaugural outfit was a savvy choice. The look set a serious tone, blending professional style with Melania's personal taste.\n\nMelania also managed to pull attention from Trump with the look, which was a feat considering how many eyes he had on him throughout the day.\n\nTraditionally, Easter fashion calls for pastel tones and festive prints like gingham, allowing people to have fun with their outfits.\n\nHowever, Melania arrived at the 2025 Easter Egg Roll at the White House in a simple cream trench coat from Mackage and heels designed by Roger Vivier.\n\nThe subdued look was a shift from Melania's more colorful outfits for previous Easter celebrations at the White House. Likewise, Mackage, a brand founded and headquartered in Canada, was a surprising choice for the first lady, given the ongoing trade dispute between the US and its northern neighbor.\n\nMelania joined her husband at Pope Francis' funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nShe wore a black coatdress designed by Dolce & Gabbana for the occasion, as well as lace gloves and a lace veil from the fashion house.\n\nWearing an Italian designer was fitting for the occasion since the Catholic Church is based in the country, though Melania also favors Dolce & Gabbana when she isn't in Italy.\n\nMelania chose a $3,900 Bottega Veneta dress for the show.\n\nThe dress had an asymmetrical neckline and gold detailing on the shoulder and waist. Melania paired the designer gown with silver and gold Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but Melania's black and white looks for Trump's second term are starting to feel a bit repetitive. A pop of color could have made the dress stand out more.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump at the US Army's 250th anniversary parade in Washington, DC, wearing another suit from Adam Lippes.\n\nBoth her $2,490 jacket and $1,190 skirt were cream-colored, with a subtle navy pinstripe pattern. The double-breasted jacket and pencil skirt had a looser, relaxed fit.\n\nBlue Christian Louboutin heels completed the ensemble.\n\nOn September 4, Melania attended a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education.\n\nShe wore a soft gray linen suit that featured white pinstripes. The jacket was oversized, and the pants were wide-legged. The first lady added structure to the look with a fitted white T-shirt and a white belt.\n\nStilettos completed the chic menswear look.\n\nOn September 16, the president and first lady arrived in the UK for a state visit. The following evening, they attended a state banquet with King Charles III, Queen Camilla, and other members of the royal family.\n\nMelania wore a bright yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera to the dinner. The dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, a column skirt, and a slit on the side. She added even more color to the ensemble with a wide, purple belt and bright green, dangly earrings.\n\nIt was nice to see Melania add some color to her wardrobe in 2025, but the bright hue and belt made the dress look a bit too casual for the event. The silhouette was pretty, but the first lady may have been better off wearing the gown in a more subdued color.\n\nOn September 23, Melania accompanied the president on a visit to the UN General Assembly, wearing a white blazer and tailored pants from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe suit was a strong choice, as the contrast of the long blazer and cropped pants felt professional and chic, and the cream Christian Louboutin shoes she paired with the look were stylish, too.\n\nHowever, the camel-colored blouse from Max Mara that she wore with the suit was almost too close to Melania's skin tone. The look would have popped more with a different colored shirt.\n\nWhen the president and first lady passed out candy at the White House on Halloween, neither opted to wear a costume. Instead, Melania donned a wool coat from Marni, which nodded to the holiday with orange trim on the collar, pockets, and lining.\n\nShe wore the khaki-colored coat buttoned to the collar, and it cinched at her waist with a thick belt — one of her go-to silhouettes. She paired the coat with taupe Manolo Blahnik heels.\n\nWhile the orange aspects of the look had a subtle Halloween feel, the outfit just didn't feel festive enough for the holiday, especially when compared to the plethora of decorations covering the White House for the event. Melania would have made a stronger statement in a full orange coat or a black and orange look.\n\nOn November 18, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, dined at the White House during his visit to the US.\n\nMelania donned a $3,350 Elie Saab dress for the occasion. The deep-green dress featured a strapless neckline, and ruching on both the bodice and the skirt added texture. A slit broke up the floor-length skirt, and Melania completed the look with black heels and sparkly earrings.\n\nEvery bit of Melania's look seemed designed to welcome Crown Prince Mohammed. The dress was similar in color to Saudi Arabia's national flag, seeming to nod to the nation. Plus, in November 2024, Elie Saab marked 45 years of his brand with \"1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,\" a massive fashion show held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMelania celebrated the end of 2025 at Trump's annual party at Mar-a-Lago wearing a sparkly, silver gown.\n\nDesigned by The New Arrivals, the $1,450 dress was sleeveless, with a scooped neckline, hugging Melania's figure as it flowed into a midi-length skirt. She paired the dress with bedazzled Christian Louboutin shoes and loose waves.\n\nThe look was festive and fitting for Florida weather, offering a refreshing change from her more subdued style.\n\nThe first lady attended the premiere of her documentary \"Melania\" in a Dolce & Gabbana skirt suit.\n\nBlack buttons lined the center of the jacket, which was cinched at Melania's waist with a black belt. The column skirt hid her mid-calf, spotlighting her black pumps.\n\nThe outfit might have been fine for any number of first lady engagements, but it felt too understated for the premiere of her film.\n\nA black gown with a professional flair may have been more appropriate for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "There was a surprising lack of \"MAGA red\" at the premiere of Melania Trump's new movie.\n\nThe first lady, her husband, and their political allies walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night to support the film, \"Melania,\" which hits theaters Friday.\n\nThere were no \"Make America Great Again\" hats or vibrant red suits in sight, though. Instead, attendees arrived in a mix of understated looks, American flag pins, and, most interestingly, blue ensembles.\n\nHere's a closer look at what attendees wore.\n\nDonald Trump posed outside the premiere in a navy suit, wearing an American flag pin on his lapel and a burgundy tie.\n\nMelania, on the other hand, chose an all-black ensemble from Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana. It comprised a straight skirt, a buttoned blazer with a thin belt, and pointed leather heels.\n\nThe outfit fit her subdued style, which she's worn throughout this presidential term. Her hair, now gold and brown, was styled in her signature waves.\n\nHe paired his pinstriped set with a white button-up shirt and an extra-skinny tie.\n\nThe latter was blue and printed with a pattern of small red crab shapes.\n\nDr. Oz and his son, Oliver, matched in blue satin suits, black dress shoes, and red ties.\n\nThe women of the family took the same approach, but with a different color palette. Lisa Oz wore a brown satin dress with gold heels and matching earrings, while Daphne Oz donned a glittering brown dress with velvet boots and a diamond necklace.\n\nHer $9,900 off-the-shoulder gown from Schiaparelli featured a floor-length skirt, all-over ruching, and a keyhole-shaped cutout down its bodice.\n\nShe wore it with dangling earrings and thick gold arm cuffs. The rapper's hair was styled in a sleek, straight look with bangs.\n\nPete Hegseth wore an ocean-blue suit with a white button-up shirt, a polka-dot tie, and brown leather dress shoes.\n\nHis wife, Jennifer, however, took a more glitzy approach. She wore a sequin-covered pantsuit with short sleeves, a V-neckline, and a black belt.\n\nShe wore the purple-and-blue ensemble with black heels and a matching clutch.\n\nThe current Secretary of Education was photographed at the movie premiere wearing a blue knee-length dress beneath a faux-fur white coat.\n\nShe also sported a silver necklace, diamond earrings, and navy loafers.",

    "fullText": "Flights to Venezuela are back on the cards for the first time in six years.\n\nNearly four weeks after the US launched military strikes in the country and captured Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump announced plans to airlines to resume flights to the country.\n\n\"We're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela and they'll be safe there.\"\n\nLate Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy rescinded a 2019 order that barred US airlines from flying to Venezuela, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration also said it had removed four notices to airmen in the Caribbean region, including one related to Venezuela.\n\n\"These NOTAMs were issued as precautionary measures and are no longer necessary,\" it said. \"Safety remains our top priority, and we look forward to facilitating the return of regular travel between the US and Venezuela.\"\n\nNearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled when the region's airspace was closed for 24 hours due to the military activity earlier this month. Some travelers spent thousands of dollars extra as they spent an extra week away from home.\n\nAmerican Airlines said on Thursday that it was \"proud to be the first airline to announce plans\" to reinstate flights to Venezuela.\n\nHowever, it could be some time before tickets are on sale.\n\nIn its announcement, American said it would share additional details \"in the coming months.\"\n\nIt added that it was working with federal authorities \"on all necessary permissions and security assessments prior to resuming service.\"\n\nAmerican first started serving Venezuela in 1987 and said it was the biggest operator there before suspending flights in 2019.\n\nThat year saw the country's political situation deteriorate as Venezuela's national assembly declared Maduro's reelection was invalid.\n\n\"We have a more than 30-year history connecting Venezolanos to the US, and we are ready to renew that incredible relationship,\" said Nat Pieper, American's chief commercial officer.\n\n\"By restarting service to Venezuela, American will offer customers the opportunity to reunite with families and create new business and commerce with the United States,\" he added.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.\n\nTrump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.”\n\n“Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.”\n\nThe threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year.\n\nJust hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trump threatened a 100% tariff on America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post.\n\nNo president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\n“Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said.\n\nBombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities, one of which, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it has announced plans to expand. It also said it has 2,800 US suppliers.\n\n“Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” said its statement. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.”\n\nTrump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft.\n\n“(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said.\n\nIf Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier makes the CRJ regional jets used on feeder flights, which typically take passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines that use CRJ on their feeder flights.\n\nBombardier also makes smaller commercial jets, the A220. But some of those A220 jets are made in the United States and some are made in Canada.\n\nSo far none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nThere are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day.\n\nGrounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data.\n\n“I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.”\n\nTaking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said.\n\n“It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.”\n\nIt’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FAA for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nCNN’s Pete Muntean contributed reporting.",

    "title": "How the weakest dollar in 4 years could undercut the relief everyday Americans get from Trump's affordability push",
    "description": "Trump said the US dollar is doing \"great,\" but a weaker currency could undercut his attempts to boost affordability for Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he's not in a rush to pump up America's sagging currency. Yet, that could be the very thing that comes back to bite his big affordability push, according to market pros, who say a weaker dollar could soon get in the way of the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs.\n\nTrump, who has made lowering borrowing costs a key goal of his second term, suggested he wasn't too pressed about the greenback's decline when speaking to reporters in Iowa this week.\n\n\"The dollar's doing great,\" Trump said, adding that he wanted the greenback to \"seek its own level\" — comments that sent the currency tumbling further to a four-year low.\n\nThe president has praised a weaker dollar before.\n\nLast year, he floated it as a positive, suggesting US firms could \"make a hell of a lot more money\" due to exports being more attractive broadly to foreign buyers.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, is down around 10% over the past year, thanks to pressures like some investors shifting away from dollar-based assets and the Fed continuing its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThere's just one problem: a weaker dollar doesn't bode well when it comes to making the case to lower interest rates. That's because a weaker currency lowers Americans' purchasing power abroad and could raise the cost of imported goods. Higher inflation could ultimately cause interest rates to rise — the opposite of what Trump is shooting for.\n\nJoe Kalish, a chief macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, said he believed the \"collapsing\" dollar could be Trump's \"Achilles' heel.\"\n\n\"If the new Fed Chair tries to push through a rate cut as soon as the June meeting, FX traders could smell blood in the water and punish the dollar, sending inflation expectations higher and worsening household affordability,\" Kalish wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that a soft dollar could result in a \"lose-lose\" situation when it came to lowering rates, even if Trump were to plug in a trusted ally as Fed Chair.\n\nA weaker dollar is also tied to the \"Sell America\" trade, the idea that investors are shifting away from US assets due to a worsening economic outlook. Investors dumping US bonds is part of that trade, something that would also cause yields to rise.\n\n\"The bond vigilantes would return and demand a higher term premium, forcing yields higher,\" Kalish added, referring to the potential for bond investors to stage a sell-off in government bonds as concerns rise over inflation, causing rates to rise in tandem.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, a key benchmark for other lending rates, was around 4.24% on Thursday, up two basis points this week. The move coincided with a 0.6 decline in the US Dollar Index over the same period.\n\nMore forecasters have been flagging the risk of higher yields due to a bond market revolt. Nela Richardson, the chief economist of ADP, said a weaker dollar could get in the way of the US's ability to sell Treasury bonds.\n\n\"A weak dollar at home doesn't always have the confidence of markets. And that confidence is going to be very important as we look at other things that are a struggle for the US economy, like sticky inflation, like high deficits and debts, and the need to sell treasuries,\" Richardson said.\n\nShe called a falling US dollar a \"double-edged sword\" when it came to Trump's economic agenda.\n\nRobert Kaplan, Goldman Sachs' vice chairman, also pointed out that a weak dollar would affect demand in the Treasury market.\n\n\"The United States has $39 trillion of debt on its way to $40 trillion plus,\" Kaplan said. \"I actually think the US is going to want to see a stable dollar and wants to see stability. And they want to be able to sell the long end of the Treasury curve. A stable dollar helps,\" he added.",

    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

    "description": "Trump's admin posted its proposed rule to overhaul student-loan repayment, including new caps on borrowing. The public will have 30 days to comment.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has insisted he’s a “kind” and “gentle” person while in the same breath blasting one of his very own appointees as a “moron.”\n\nThe president’s comments came as part of a confused and rambling Truth Social tirade posted early Thursday morning. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell again refused to cut interest rates, even though he has absolutely no reason to keep them so high,” Trump began.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly lambasted Powell, who he appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018, for refusing to follow White House instructions on interest rates. Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "The secretary acknowledged that the president misspoke, despite claims from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that President Donald Trump had previously misspoken while defending his campaign to acquire Greenland — and critics are pouncing.\n\nWhile testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions for the first time since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela led to the capturing of leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife. He said that the former regime represented an “untenable situation,” telling lawmakers that the United States does not intend nor expect to take any further military action “at this time.”\n\nAt one point, Rubio was asked a question by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) about the president’s desire to acquire Greenland, which was renewed in the days following the raid. Kaine pointed to an instance last week when Trump said Iceland instead of Greenland four times while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy, right? Last time,” Trump said, referencing a previous nickname from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nAbout a minute later, Trump claimed that “they are not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you.”\n\n“I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”\n\nDuring the hearing, Kaine asked Rubio directly: “The president repeatedly mistook Iceland for Greenland, right? We’re not mad at Iceland... the president just mistook the two countries for each other, correct?”\n\n“Yeah, he meant to say Greenland, but I think we’re all familiar with presidents that have verbal stumbles,” Rubio said, appearing to take a jab at former President Joe Biden. “We’ve had presidents like that before. Some made a lot more than this one.”\n\nAfter some reporters and critics noted the president’s mistake, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly hopped on the defense, responding to NewsNation’s Libbey Dean, who posted on X that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”\n\n“No he didn’t, [Libbey],” Leavitt replied. “His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here.”\n\nLeavitt’s post has since been marked with a community note, with X users claiming that she is “not telling the truth.”\n\nA number of Trump’s critics quickly pummeled Leavitt following the exchange with Rubio.\n\n“Rubio calls Karoline Leavitt a liar,” the progressive network MeidasTouch wrote in response, though Rubio did not use the label directly.\n\n“So the Press Secretary wasn’t on the level here?” another user asked. “Shocking.”\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Fred Wellman added: “Swing and a miss, Marco! Better luck next time.”\n\nTrump told reporters last week that he would announce details of a compromise in “two weeks” related to the future of Greenland, which falls under the boundaries of Denmark, a NATO ally. His deadline came one day after he announced a “framework of a deal” with the NATO alliance, without providing any details.\n\nTrump called a potential proposal “infinite,” adding that it will be “a deal that’s forever.”\n\nRubio said during Wednesday’s hearing that “we’re in a good place right now” with Greenland. He noted that there is a “professional” process underway that will result in a “good outcome for everybody.”\n\nTrump has faced fierce resistance from officials in both Greenland and Denmark, who have argued that the semi-autonomous Arctic territory is not for sale. The president, however, has frequently maintained that ownership over the island, home to critical rare earth minerals, is necessary for national security, while warning against Russia or China occupying it in the future.\n\nIn his announcement of a “framework,” Trump also pointed to his proposed “Golden Dome,” a missile defense system that he has previously teased will be operating before the end of his term in 2029.\n\n“Because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's $1,000 to \"Trump Accounts\" for employees' kids.\n\nThe banks each employ more than 160,000 employees in the US.\n\n\"Trump accounts\" are Treasury-funded accounts that give $1,000 to newborn Americans.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "fullText": "Under Donald Trump, the White House has filled its social media with memes, wishcasting, nostalgia and deepfakes. Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trolling\n\nIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.\n\nThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.\n\nThe image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, held up the image at a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social in October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”\n\nOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became a sensation in March 2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).\n\nThe White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.\n\nFor Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”\n\nThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.\n\nPredictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and was met with outrage from Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”\n\nAs so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”\n\nTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digital Trump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.\n\nIn 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body of Superman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroically striding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.\n\nWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.\n\nThe image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . The Trump administration then doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.\n\nFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White House posted an AI video of a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.\n\nEven if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According to one paper by the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.\n\nAgain, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.\n\nThe slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.\n\n“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”\n\nIn August, the Department of Homeland Security posted a mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).\n\n“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters, 80s action-movie posters or 1950s public information campaigns (as with a recent image of Trump as a friendly milkman).\n\nAI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist, Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.\n\n“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.\n\nHalf an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.\n\nUntil this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.\n\nAs with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.\n\nThe fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”\n\nAfter the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”\n\nTo those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country's threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday's event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt's unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county's chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn't been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar's safety has been an issue for years. After Trump's initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.\n\nBiesecker and Brown reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Donald Trump blasts mind-boggling Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub",

    "description": "Trump's pick to replace Powell could add a layer of uncertainty to how traders have been navigating bets on Fed rate decisions.",
    "fullText": "Bettors on prediction markets love wagering on Fed decisions.\n\nIn a post on its blog, Polymarket said that Fed moves are a favorite bet for a certain kind of trader, and they've identified a framework for how they're navigating the market.\n\nPolymarket's internal data shows that the moment when the odds around a Fed decision \"crystallize\"—defined as the leading odds becoming dominant and ceasing to flip—actually sets in weeks before the meeting. This probably is not surprising, as futures markets tend to broadcast the Fed rate-cut odds for weeks or even months before the next meeting.\n\nStill, Polymarket's blog shows how certain kinds of bets known as \"bonds,\" which are high-probability bets that rarely flip, are approached by bettors.\n\n\"Across 22 Fed decisions from March 2023 to December 2025, I find that Polymarket odds crystallize with a median of ~26 days before the Fed meeting, which is early enough to create tradable entry points,\" the author of the post writes.\n\n\"Crystallization\" is defined by one outcome pulling ahead with at least 80% odds and remaining stable for several days in a row without any major swings.\n\nThe post also notes that, in most cases, odds of a rate decision settle early, as the central bank typically chooses between keeping rates unchanged or adjusting them by 25bp. However, recently, the US economy has faced a lot more uncertainty around the economy and the path of interest rates.\n\n\"Each new data release can completely reverse market expectations, preventing odds from stabilizing,\" the post said. \"Prospectively, traders can identify regime shifts by reading more on Fed communications signaling framework uncertainty or monitoring elevated VIX for a continuous period.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlights the key lead-lag relationship between institutional markets, which adjust to monetary speculation almost immediately, and prediction markets, which typically react roughly a day and a half later.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket aren't uncovering new information. Rather they are mirroring moves already priced in by other markets, creating small windows where Polymarket odds have not caught up to the broader market.\n\n\"It is worth noting that traders should view this on a relative-value basis rather than solely believing one is correct while the other is wrong as odds could flip quickly with new emerging data.\"\n\nThe author noted, though, that there is a potential wildcard for traders to consider going forward. Trump is set to replace Powell as Fed chair this year, and when he does, the central bank's new leader could abandon the forward-guidance policy, a key component of Polymarket's trading strategy.\n\nLee acknowledged that such a scenario would mark the type of regime shift that would be a test of the framework he outlined for navigating Fed policy moves.",

There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n\nBelichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.\n\nHowever, Brady said he was \"not worried\" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe added: \"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives.\"",
