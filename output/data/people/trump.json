    "description": "The Supreme Court struck down one set of tariffs only for President Trump to slap new ones on. It's a bit of relief for CEOs, but not a complete fix.",
    "fullText": "When the Supreme Court struck down a major pillar of President Donald Trump's tariff policy last week, \"there were no big fireworks that went off\" at Stew Leonard's, the New York-based grocery chain's CEO, Stew Leonard Jr., told Business Insider.\n\nThe retailer relies on international vendors for products such as New Zealand lamb and European wines and cheeses, and it has raised prices on items that were affected over the last year, citing import costs, Leonard said.\n\nWhile eliminating tariffs entirely would have provided some relief for low-margin businesses like Leonard's, Trump immediately vowed to impose similar costs under a different legal framework.\n\n\"The tariff thing you got to play almost day by day,\" Leonard said. \"Even talking to our suppliers, if I asked them for any prediction, they have no idea.\"\n\nMichigan State University supply chain professor Jason Miller told Business Insider that the new 10% base rate tariff represents a modest reduction in costs for some products, especially those from China, India, and Brazil, but that the 15% rate could end up being more expensive than some previously negotiated trade deals.\n\n\"We're back to this very elevated level of uncertainty, and that is going to again create questions for firms,\" he said. \"Do they move ahead with courses of action, or do they pause?\"\n\nFederal investigations are also underway into other tariff frameworks that could result in even higher fees for certain items containing aluminum, steel, and other materials if the government decides to change how it calculates those rates.\n\n\"That is the big concern right now, but we don't know what that looks like yet,\" Miller said.\n\nConsumer companies' earnings calls this week included several new estimates of the financial hit tariffs have represented to their profits over the past year, but hardly any of their executives said they were immediately adjusting their strategies in response to the flurry of changes.\n\nFootwear maker Steve Madden went further than most, opting on Wednesday to pull its financial forecasts \"until there's more clarity around tariffs.\"\n\nJing Gao, founder and CEO of Fly By Jing, told Business Insider her Chinese food brand is still trying to understand the full picture of how it will be affected under the new (and changing) rules.\n\n\"It's important for us not to make major, potentially irreversible decisions without understanding the full landscape,\" she said over email.\n\nIn particular, she said she has no plans to shift the sourcing of her Sichuan chili crisp supplies to the US: \"You can't grow these ingredients in America.\"\n\nAnother wrinkle for importers is that the law Trump is using for this latest round of tariffs (Section 122) has a 150-day limit, unless Congress extends it.\n\n\"The impact of the tariffs remains largely unchanged for now, but the 150-day countdown adds another layer of uncertainty,\" Gao said. \"This kind of volatility is especially disruptive.\"\n\nFedEx used the Supreme Court's decision to join the list of companies suing the government over the now-illegal tariff charges; however, the CEOs who spoke with Business Insider aren't rushing to get refunds.\n\nCaleb Nicholes, co-owner of Wisconsin-based Wonderstate Coffee, told Business Insider his company paid $140,000 in tariff charges in 2025 before coffee beans received an exemption in November. (The new order excludes many of the same items, like bananas and coffee, that were previously exempted under the overturned rules.)\n\n\"These political experiments are having real-time implications on the sustainability of our business,\" Nicholes said. \"We don't have a lot of room to play around with these kinds of $140,000 bills that are getting thrown around.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's latest ruling gave Nicholes the opportunity to explore legal action, such as joining a potential class action lawsuit, to secure a refund of Wonderstate's tariff payments. It's a bureaucratic battle that could drag on for years, he said.\n\nNot everyone is so willing to take on the government, especially if, like Stew Leonard, they have already found ways to mitigate those costs.\n\n\"We're just looking forward right now,\" Leonard, the grocer, said. \"I wouldn't really look at waging a lawsuit against the government.\"",

    "description": "The best time to chip away at the national debt and balance the budget is now, when the economy is strong, says the IMF. Trump’s trade tariffs are making that difficult.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. economy remains the envy of the world in many respects, at least in President Donald Trump’s telling. But its lofty position is threatened by, among other things, America’s own chronic inability to keep a balanced budget, and the administration’s trade policy is part of what’s holding it back from doing so.\n\nWhat challenges does America's budget deficit pose?\n\nWhat solutions does the IMF recommend for fiscal balance?\n\nHow are Trump's tariffs affecting economic growth?\n\nWhy is timing crucial for addressing fiscal imbalances?\n\nIn his State of the Union address this week, Trump said the U.S. was “winning again, and in fact, we’re winning so much that we really don’t know what to do about it.” Despite suffering from low approval ratings, Trump might soon score points for the economy, courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, which this week highlighted how the U.S. remains in many ways an economic powerhouse.\n\nStrong economic growth, rising productivity, and a labor market that has proved adaptable and resilient combine to paint a rosy picture of the U.S. economy, according to Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF’s managing director.\n\n“We expect that a buoyant U.S. economy will continue to grow strongly throughout this and next year,” Georgieva said on Wednesday, shortly after her agency had released its annual review and outlook for the U.S. economy.\n\nGeorgieva lauded the “remarkable performance” of the U.S. private sector over the past year. GDP growth reached 2.2% in 2025, and the IMF projects it to accelerate to 2.4% for this year. This resilience has turned the U.S. into a primary economic driver for the world that is creating “positive spillovers to the global economy” at a time of high international uncertainty, she added.\n\nA strong economy could be the country’s best chance to patch up its growing deficit, Georgieva said. But at least according to the IMF’s recommendations, Trump’s love for punitive tariffs as a main driving force in his trade policy might be actively working against reaching a balanced budget.\n\nThe deteriorating state of the country’s fiscal balance threatens to extinguish the benefits of America’s strong economy. Under current policies, general government debt—the measure of how much more the country is spending than taking in—could hit 140% of GDP in the next five years, according to the IMF, possibly more than $50 trillion. The agency noted a troubling paradox in recent policy shifts. While tax and spending changes legislated mostly through the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year are expected to modestly boost economic activity this year and next, they’ll be overshadowed by increased spending and lower tax revenue that continue to push federal debt higher.\n\nTrump has framed his tariffs as a key measure to bring in more revenue and reduce the deficit, but Georgieva implicitly pushed back against that narrative. She called U.S. tariffs a “headwind to even stronger growth” that dragged down productivity. In the story of a strong U.S. economy, “we could have seen more of the good news” without the penalizing effect of tariffs, she said.",

    "fullText": "Critics are calling out President Donald Trump and his administration after what appears to have been a massive screw-up in the airspace around El Paso, Texas, for the second time in less than a month.\n\nThe U.S. military on Thursday reportedly used a laser weapon to shoot down a drone near the U.S.-Mexico border. It turned out the drone was operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, The Associated Press reported.\n\nEarlier this month, the FAA shut down the El Paso airport and surrounding airspace after CBP used a laser to shoot down party balloons that it had mistakenly believed to be Mexican drug cartel drones. CBS News reported that the closure was also related to military tests of the laser weapon, as well as a dispute with the FAA over how to handle them.\n\nPolitics: Stephen Miller Had A Wild 8-Hour Crash Out On X, And Only Stopped After Brutal Clapback\n\nIn the latest case, the FAA closed off airspace, but not the airport. The move did not impact commercial flights, AP reported.\n\nCartel drones have been spotted with increased frequency near the border. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that they tend to be “crudely adapted” off-the-shelf models and are used for both surveillance and to drop drug packages.\n\nHowever, critics slammed the Trump administration for deploying experimental weapons without even correctly identifying the target:\n\nThey got Star Wars tech but can't tell friend from foe.

Trump delivers 12,000+ homes, most since 1973.\"\n\nThe mockup was made in the same style as the infamous Daily News headline about President Gerald Ford in 1975: \"Ford to city: drop dead.\"\n\nSome people on X were amused by how the mayor managed to make Trump — his political antithesis — look so happy in a photo op.\n\nSo good.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow it to move ahead with ending legal protections for migrants from Syria, in the latest emergency appeal to the nation's highest court.\n\nThe Department of Justice wants the court to lift a New York judge's ruling halting the Department of Homeland Security's decision to end temporary protected status for Syrians while lawsuits play out.\n\nThe government is also asking for a broader ruling that could affect other cases over protections for people from other countries as the administration pursues its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe conservative-majority court has previously allowed immigration authorities to end legal protections for migrants from Venezuela as litigation continues.\n\nAbout 6,100 people from Syria have temporary legal status after fleeing armed conflict, according to court documents. Ending those protections could halt their authorization to work legally in the United States and expose more to possible deportation, especially the 800 people with pending applications, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nProtections for Syrians were first granted protected status in 2012, during a civil war that lasted for more than a decade before the fall of President Bashar Assad’s government in late 2024.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted to revoke protected status less than a year later, finding that the situation \"no longer meets the criteria for an ongoing armed conflict that poses a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Syrian nationals.\"\n\nImmigration lawyers challenged that decision, arguing that Syria was still wrestling with a humanitarian crisis and the swift revocation of legal protections would force Syrians in the United States to confront “impossible choices.”\n\nJudge Katherine Polk Failla, who was nominated by democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to delay the termination in November. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left her decision in place.\n\nThe administration argues that the department can grant or revoke the temporary protections and judges should not interfere. A response to the administration's appeal is due March 4.\n\nDHS has taken steps to withdraw legal protections that have allowed immigrants from multiple countries to remain in the United States and work legally. That includes a combined total of more than a million people from Venezuela and Haiti. A different judge in Washington recently blocked the administration from ending protections for 350,000 Haitians.\n\nThe administration has scored a series of wins on the Supreme Court's emergency docket allowing it to move ahead with key parts of Trump's agenda, though the justices handed him a significant defeat on tariffs last week.\n\nCongress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation is granted in 18-month increments by the homeland security secretary.",

    "description": "The Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a \"national emergency\" over America's elections.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump gestures after speaking to soldiers and their families at Fort Bragg, N.C., Friday, Feb. 13, 2026. \n\nThe Washington Post reported that activists are working with the White House on an executive order to declare a “national emergency” over America’s elections and pave the way for a power grab.\n\n“Pro-Trump activists who say they are in coordination with the White House are circulating a 17-page draft executive order that claims China interfered in the 2020 election as a basis to declare a national emergency that would unlock extraordinary presidential power over voting,” reported the Post‘s Isaac Arnsdorf. “President Donald Trump has repeatedly previewed a plan to mandate voter ID and ban mail ballots in November’s midterm elections, and the activists expect their draft will figure into Trump’s promised executive order on the issue.”\n\nPeter Ticktin, a MAGA activist in favor of the executive order, told the Post that “we have a situation where the president is aware that there are foreign interests that are interfering in our election processes,” and that “the president has to be able to deal with it,” including by banning mail-in ballots and certain voting machines.\n\n“If there was a provable foreign intrusion, that would be a national security emergency and the order could be issued under his powers as commander in chief,” added Jerome Corsi, another activist lobbying on behalf of the executive order.\n\nTrump has long alleged that the country’s elections are “rigged,” most notably after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, when his false claims culminated in a violent riot at the Capitol Building.\n\nTrump told Dan Bongino, the conservative commentator and former deputy director of the FBI, that “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over, we should take over the voting in at least 15 places'” earlier this month.\n\n“The Republicans oughta nationalize the voting,” he added.\n\nTrump previously promised to act unilaterally if Congress failed to pass a bill mandating voter I.D.\n\n“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS. They have all sorts of reasons why it shouldn’t be passed, and then boldly laugh in the backrooms after their ridiculous presentations. If it weren’t such a serious matter, it would be considered a TOTAL JOKE! No Voter I.D. is even crazier, and more ridiculous, than Men playing in Women’s Sports, Open Borders, or Transgender for Everyone. Republicans must put this at the top of every speech — It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND! Even Democrat Voters agree, 85%, that there should be Voter I.D. It’s only the Political ‘Leaders,’ Crooked Losers like Schumer and Jeffries, that have no shame, and explain why it’s “racist,” and every other thing that they can think of,” wrote the president in a February 13 Truth Social post. “This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW! If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Mulling Plan to Declare ‘National Emergency’ Paving Way for Major Power Grab first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Fewer Americans tuned into the State of the Union this year, even as President Donald Trump delivered the longest one in history.\n\nPreliminary data released by Nielsen on Wednesday showed an estimated 12 percent decrease in total viewership for the State of the Union Address across the seven most-watched networks: ABC, CBS, CNN, MS Now, NBC, Fox News, and the Fox broadcast network.\n\nTrump’s 108-minute-long speech drew about 27.8 million viewers, down from an audience of 31.45 million for his address to a joint session of Congress last year.\n\nFox News Channel led the way with 9.1 million viewers between 9:15 and 11 p.m. ET, though it still saw a 15-percent year-over-year drop in total viewers. It was trailed by ABC News with 5.1 million viewers, NBC with 3.6 million, and CBS with 3.3 million.\n\nCNN and MS NOW each logged about 2 million viewers, marking double-digit year-over-year growth.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment. The Hollywood Reporter noted that a decline in State of the Union viewership after the president’s first year in office is fairly common in recent history, citing a similar downtrend for Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Trump in his first term.\n\nTrump, 79, stayed mostly on message as he touted the supposed success of his first year back in office, announced several awards for everyone from a hockey goaltender to a military hero, and introduced multiple guests to put a face to his policies.\n\nThe president also welcomed the U.S. men’s hockey team early into his speech to laud their victory in the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\n“President Trump absolutely knocked it out of the park tonight,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on her personal X account. “I am so proud to work for him, and so proud to be an American!”\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, didn’t miss the opportunity to protest. Texas Rep. Al Green got kicked out for holding a sign that read “Black People Aren’t Apes,” in an apparent reference to Trump’s racist Truth Social post depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle as apes.\n\nMinnesota’s Ilhan Omar and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib also heckled Trump mid-speech, triggering a fresh social media meltdown from the president.\n\n“When people can behave like that, and knowing that they are Crooked and Corrupt Politicians, so bad for our Country, we should send them back from where they came — as fast as possible,” he wrote in a lengthy rant. “They can only damage the United States of America, they can do nothing to help it.”",

    "title": "Democrats Should Launch a “Nuremberg Caucus” to Investigate the Crimes of the Trump Regime",
    "description": "Aaron...",
    "fullText": "Administration officials and their collaborators must know that if they break the law they will be punished. There must not be impunity for those attacking our democracy.\n\nCory Doctorow understands the value of a good label. A writer and longtime critic of corporate consolidation, particularly in the tech industry, Doctorow coined the term “enshittification” to describe the process by which corporations degrade their online platforms to maximize short-term profits. It captured the shared experience of our worsening digital lives so well that the American Dialect Society named “enshittification” the 2023 word of the year.\n\nRecently, after posing the question “What would a real political response to fascism look like?,” Doctorow articulated another idea that I think similarly captures our zeitgeist. In a blog post, Doctorow proposed that congressional Democrats launch a “Nuremberg Caucus,” an effort to determine what accountability for the grotesqueries of Trump’s regime should look like. People need to be held responsible for the corruption, concentration camps, and executions of US civilians by federal goon squads.\n\nIn Doctorow’s conception, the core of this project would be a public-facing platform where Democrats could assemble evidence of the administration’s crimes and promise trials for the perpetrators. In his words, “Each fresh outrage, each statement, each video-clip—whether of Trump officials or of his shock-troops—could be neatly slotted in, given an exhibit number, and annotated with the criminal and civil violations captured in the evidence. The caucus could publish dates these trials will be held on—following from Jan 20, 2029—and even which courtrooms each official, high and low, will be tried in.”\n\nAn initiative like this is necessary on its merits. Healthy democracies do not respond to attempts to impose authoritarian rule by allowing their perpetrators to remain in positions of power. Just this month, South Korea sentenced its former right-wing president, Yoon Suk-yeol, to life imprisonment for his 2024 attempt to impose martial law. And South Korea isn’t alone—both Peru and Brazil recently condemned their former presidents to long prison sentences for their coup attempts. There’s a strong case to be made that our country’s current dystopia is a result of the Democrats’ failure to put this principle into practice after Trump’s first term. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland’s refusal to file timely charges against Trump for seeking to overturn the 2020 election cannot be repeated.\n\nAs Doctorow put it when I called him up to discuss this idea, “We’re talking about people who violated their oath of office. They are categorically unfit to be in public service, and they need to be kept away from the levers of power.” The process of organizing a Nuremberg Caucus would force Democrats to commit to holding these bad actors accountable for their crimes.\n\nA Nuremberg Caucus could also be a political boon for Democrats, offering them an effective tool for directing public attention toward the criminality of Trump’s regime. It’s one thing to say, “We need accountability.” It’s more compelling to say, “This specific official committed this specific crime—and here’s the evidence, here’s the witness list, expect a prosecution in early 2029.”\n\nMoreover, this structure would provide Democrats with a powerful narrative to project onto Republicans. As Doctorow explained to me, “The minute you can get your adversary to say, ‘These are the ways we’re not Nazis,’ they are implying that there are a bunch of ways in which they are. It forces the adversary into your frame.” Debating whether Trump officials deserve Nuremberg-style trials is a favorable field on which to fight electoral battles.\n\nIn addition to these political benefits, a Nuremberg Caucus could also have deterrent effects. It’s an oft-repeated talking point in liberal circles that Trump officials are not acting like people who think they will have to face free and fair elections again—that the blatant vulgarity with which they’ve been committing their crimes is proof that they know our democracy is in the bag. These concerns are valid. Republicans are preparing to rig the midterms, and we urgently need to be doing everything we can to foil these plots. But there is an additional explanation for their brazenness that I think is just as likely: The GOP has concluded that even if the Democratic Party were to sweep back into power, its leaders are too feckless, cowardly, or incompetent to mete out consequences to Trump officials for their criminality.\n\nThis is a rational deduction for Republicans—one based not only on Garland’s failure to prosecute any senior member of Trump’s first administration but also on the Obama administration’s refusal to pursue accountability for Bush-era war crimes or Wall Street’s demolition of the world economy. This reasonable assumption, however, makes Trump’s regime far more dangerous than it otherwise would be.\n\nAssumed impunity is what gives Trump’s Gestapo thugs the confidence to murder civilians on video in broad daylight. It’s what allows Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to order double-tap strikes against civilians, Attorney General Pam Bondi to violate legal orders to release the Epstein files, and Secretary Kristi Noem to oversee the construction of concentration camps. Officials who believed that Democrats would hold them accountable would have some motivation to constrain the breadth and scope of such criminality—motivation that members of this administration obviously lack.\n\nThe same might be said of the bootlicking elites who have spent the last year competing to see who can display the most cowardice in the face of Trump’s authoritarian takeover. Why have so many of the wealthy and powerful embraced such a demeaning posture, despite being more insulated from fascist retaliation than the millions of regular people whose response to seeing Renee Good and Alex Pretti get gunned down has been to protest even harder?\n\nCertainly some elites, particularly the full-on oligarchs, are earnestly sympathetic to Trump’s fascist goals. But for many—the Big Law firm heads, the elite university leaders, the corporate executives—the craven collaboration is pragmatic. Trump is a fact of life; there are benefits to participating in his fascist project; and—putting aside honor, dignity, and morality—there don’t appear to be serious consequences on the horizon for those who acquiesce to his corrupt demands.\n\nIf US elites care only about their own self-interest, as they have proven conclusively over the course of Trump’s second term, then the impetus is on Democrats to demonstrate that collaborating with fascist criminals will have ramifications once they retake Congress or the White House.\n\nDoctorow said he believes there are actions a Nuremberg Caucus could take to contribute to that calculation shift. For example, Democrats could announce their intent to undertake scrutiny of all mergers approved by the Trump administration, putting corporations on notice that “they should expect lengthy, probing inquiries into any mergers they undertake between now and the fall of Trumpism.” A Nuremberg Caucus could also publish plans to conduct systemic IRS audits of the ultra-wealthy to identify any suspicious wealth gains that might be the fruit of corrupt dealings with the administration.\n\nA final attribute of this project—and perhaps the most fun one to think about—is its potential to sow discord within the ranks of Trump’s regime. Doctorow imagines the Nuremberg Caucus announcing a plan to furnish $1 million bounties to any ICE officer who provides evidence leading to the conviction of another ICE officer for committing human rights violations. If ICE recruits are signing up based on the promise of $50,000 signing bonuses, what would they do for a million bucks? And how would it affect ICE’s operations if agents started worrying that the next time they chose to brutalize an immigrant or kidnap a child or attack a school with chemical weapons, the guy in the balaclava next to them might be taking notes? We can extend that principle up through the ranks of the administration, which we know is disproportionately full of nutjobs with paranoid delusions. A Nuremberg Caucus could do a lot to help feed that paranoia.\n\nOf course, Doctorow’s proposal is just one of many possible answers to the question of how to rebuild our democracy. But it’s a compelling one—compelling enough that, if Democrats won’t take the suggestion, I hope some of the advocacy groups helping to lead the anti-Trump resistance consider it. There are nongovernmental models for this kind of project—for example, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) is an organization “dedicated to collecting evidence up to a criminal law standard for the express purpose of furthering criminal justice efforts to end impunity.” CIJA targets international human rights abuses, with recent efforts focused on war crimes in Syria and Myanmar. But a similar structure—a Nuremberg Project rather than a Nuremberg Caucus—could be organized by progressive nonprofits here in the United States.\n\nWhatever form it takes, this work cannot be ignored. Impunity is a cancer in democracies. Impunity for economic elites helped create the loss of faith in our institutions that was so critical to Trump’s initial ascendance, and impunity for government officials who betrayed our Constitution is what facilitated Trump’s return to power. We cannot keep repeating this pattern.\n\nOver the last year, Republicans have turned our federal government into a vast mafia syndicate whose criminal enterprises—graft and corruption, violence and human rights abuses, cover-ups for the wealthy and well-connected—are being operated without any fear of consequences. That must change, and it’s time for Democrats, and perhaps our broader antifascist resistance movement, to show that we have a plan to bring the architects and executors of this regime’s crimes to justice.",

    "fullText": "Time to save America from the SAVE America Act.\n\nDonald Trump’s second term has been marked by scenes of naked authoritarianism, from federal agents raiding a Georgia elections office to killings in the streets of American cities.\n\nBut there is another variety of authoritarian encroachment underway—this one calmly procedural, but with the potential to be just as devastating to American democracy.\n\nEarlier this month, the House passed the SAVE America Act, which threatens to block millions from voting in November. It’s just one salvo in a multipronged Republican effort to undermine the midterms and lay the groundwork for a new round of 2020-style election denialism should Democrats win Congress. From the flurry of Trump-instigated redistricting efforts to the new FCC guidance that spurred CBS to pull Stephen Colbert’s interview with Texas Senate hopeful James Talarico, Trump and his allies are using every tool at their disposal to depress turnout, intimidate voters, and unjustly tilt the electoral balance toward Republicans.\n\nLast spring, election-denier Pam Bondi’s Department of Justice began requesting confidential voter registration data from states and jurisdictions around the country—and suing those that refuse to comply. The information the agency collects is being shared with the Department of Homeland Security, which has launched its own effort to investigate naturalized Americans accused of voting before gaining their citizenship. And, shortly after January’s Fulton County FBI raid, Trump called for Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” though the Constitution he vowed to preserve, protect, and defend gives the executive branch no authority to manage elections.\n\nIf approved by the Senate, the SAVE America Act could be this administration’s most devastating blow yet to voter participation. The bill would require states to share their voter data with DHS, along with forcing Americans to furnish a photo ID at the polls and produce proof of citizenship before registering to vote. This is despite the fact that Trump’s own profoundly compromised Justice Department claims it has identified only 10,000 noncitizens on the rolls after examining nearly 50 million registrations. Under the guise of preventing hypothetical ballot-casting by .02 percent of the enrolled voter base, then, 21 million Americans who lack immediate access to their birth certificate or a passport could lose the franchise.\n\nIn this attempt to shrink the electorate, Trump and congressional Republicans are using the levers of democratic governance to undermine democracy itself—a strategy sometimes referred to as stealth authoritarianism. It’s practiced by despotic regimes like that of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, who reshaped his country’s electoral system to hamstring his opponents. Naturally, he has few more devoted fans than our president, whose administration is bear-hugging Orbán in the lead-up to another technically free yet profoundly unfair Hungarian election.\n\nAs our own midterms approach, Americans cannot be sure that Trump will restrict himself to procedural manipulations. He has expressed regret that he did not order the military to seize voting machines after his 2020 loss, and could very well decide to use this cycle to make up for lost time. Even more likely, however, are tactics at the margins designed to intimidate voters and disrupt proceedings. Arizona Republicans are seeking to station ICE agents at polling sites, while their Indiana counterparts want to truncate the state’s early voting period, and the Republican National Committee pushes to restrict the counting of mail-in ballots.\n\nThe SAVE America Act at least faces an uncertain path to the Resolute Desk, as Senate Republicans lack the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster. And despite the right’s myriad efforts to stack the deck in its favor, Americans could still deliver Democrats a November victory so resounding that cries of election rigging will ring obviously hollow. Only a year into his term, the president has already lost considerable ground with the Black and Hispanic voters who helped secure his most recent victory, and states from New York to California are implementing measures designed to fortify their elections against outside interference.\n\nStill, a rout is by no means assured. Democrats have been sounding the alarm on Trump’s authoritarian tendencies ever since his glide down the golden escalator, but calls to save American democracy have failed to resonate amid an affordability crisis that finds families nationwide struggling to contend with the ever-inflating cost of food and housing. So, in a savvy democracy strategy, progressives would be wise to fuse Trump’s threats to the integrity of our system of governance with a bold case for their ability to lift the middle class out of despondency.\n\nDuring his 1984 presidential run, the late Jesse Jackson credited Ronald Reagan’s 1980 win not solely to his persuasion of Democrats and independents but also to the large numbers of demoralized young, poor, and minority voters who sat out the election altogether. These were the people Jackson claimed as his constituency, ”the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised.” Their absence at the polls had handed Reagan the precedency, Jackson argued, a victory delivered “by the margin of despair.”",

    "fullText": "A photo authentically shows future U.S. first lady Melania Trump, then Melania Knauss, posing partially nude for modeling pictures on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's airplane.\n\nIn early 2026 — following the release of the movie \"Melania\" — online users shared a rumor claiming a years-old image showed U.S. first lady Melania Trump, then Melania Knauss, posing partially n*de with a briefcase filled with jewelry on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's airplane.\n\nUsers shared this claim on Facebook, Instagram (archived), Threads (archived), and X (archived), including an image meme (archived) reading, \"Fun fact: This famous picture of first lady Melania Trump was taken on Jeffrey Epstein's plane.\" Snopes received reader mail asking whether the posts were accurate.\n\nIn short, users shared an authentic picture of Trump with captions that were false, so we've rated this claim miscaptioned. The photo was real and was not manipulated with artificial intelligence or other image-editing software. GQ magazine's January 2000 issue credited photographer Antoine Verglas with capturing the pictures on President Donald Trump's former Boeing 727 — not an Epstein-owned aircraft.\n\nWe contacted a spokesperson for the first lady and also Verglas to ask about this matter but did not receive responses.\n\nOn Nov. 8, 2016 — the date of Donald Trump's first Election Day victory — GQ reported once again about the pictures from the photo shoot for the January 2000 issue, including noting where Verglas captured the images:\n\nSixteen years ago we profiled Donald Trump's then-girlfriend Melania Knauss. Now his wife, Melania featured in our naked profile shoot on his customised Boeing 727 wearing handcuffs, wielding diamonds and holding a chrome pistol (it was the lads mag era after all). It makes for some interesting reading today, considering Donald Trump's success in the US election…\n\n\"We were bombarded by requests to shoot Melania,\" GQ editor Dylan Jones said when asked about our January 2000 n*de shoot with Melania Trump, after we had dug through the archives and published the images online in March 2016. \"Given that she was obviously so keen to be featured in GQ, we came up with a rather kitsch and camp story for her to feature in.\" Donald Trump also requested that photographs be delivered to his office. \"We framed the cover and a selection of prints and sent them as soon as we could.\"\n\nThe WorthPoint antiques, art and collectibles archiving company hosted images of the original print edition of GQ's January 2000 issue, including a picture showing a photo caption mentioning Trump's Boeing 727 as the shoot's location.\n\nIn September 2024, Melania Trump — ahead of the release of her memoir, \"Melania\" — shared a statement (archived) on social media defending her n*de modeling photos. The statement read:\n\nMelania Trump speaks about her n*de modeling work:\n\n\"Why do I stand proudly behind my n*de modeling work? The more pressing question is - why has the media chosen to scrutinize my celebration of the human form in a fashion photoshoot? Are we no longer able to appreciate the beauty of the human body? Throughout history, master artists have revered the human shape, evoking profound emotions and admiration. We should honor our bodies and embrace the timeless tradition of using art as a powerful means of self expression.\"\n\nShe also shared a video (archived) in which she read the words from the statement:\n\nMelania Trump speaks about her n*de modeling work:\n\n“Why do I stand proudly behind my n*de modeling work?

    "fullText": "The Trump administration is blocking Venezuela's government from paying for the cost of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's defense against drug trafficking charges in New York, a move that potentially interferes with his constitutional right to counsel, his lawyer says.\n\nAttorney Barry Pollack told a Manhattan federal judge in an email last week that the U.S. Treasury Department had blocked the authorization of legal fees that the government of Venezuela is required to pay for Maduro and First Lady Cilia Flores under its law and custom. The email was entered into the public court record on Wednesday.\n\nMaduro and his wife have been jailed in New York without bail since they were seized from their Venezuelan home Jan. 3 in a stealth nighttime raid by U.S. military forces. They have both pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe stunning capture following a monthslong military buildup in the Caribbean has paved the way for the Trump administration to assert enormous influence over Maduro's replacement, his vice president and now acting President Delcy Rodriguez. Under pressure from the U.S., Rodriguez has moved swiftly to open up Venezuela's oil industry to American investment, free political prisoners and reestablish direct communications with Washington — something unseen since the first Trump administration shuttered the U.S. embassy in Caracas in 2019.\n\nIn the email, Pollack said that the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions against Venezuela, had granted permission on Jan. 9 approving the payment of legal fees by the Venezuelan government.\n\nLess than three hours later, though, the Trump administration snatched back the authorization “without explanation,” though it left in place a license granting permission for Maduro's wife's lawyers to be paid, Pollack said.\n\nThe dispute over Maduro’s legal fees is intimately linked to U.S. foreign policy. The first Trump administration cut ties with Maduro in 2019, recognizing the then opposition head of the National Assembly as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. The Biden administration hewed closely to the same policy.\n\nHowever, allowing Rodriguez’s government to pay for the cost of Maduro’s defense could complicate prosecutors' efforts in court to counter the deposed leader’s argument that his capture was illegal and that as the foreign head of a state he is immune from prosecution under U.S. and international law.\n\nA 25-page indictment against Maduro accused him and others of working with drug cartels and members of the military to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. Both he and his wife face life in prison if convicted.\n\nAs part of the purported conspiracy, Maduro and his wife allegedly ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders of those who owed them drug money, according to the indictment. It said that included the killing of a local drug boss in Caracas.\n\nMessages seeking comment from the Treasury Department, White House and the Justice Department were not immediately returned.\n\nPollack said he asked the Office of Foreign Assets Control on Feb. 11 to reinstate the original license and clear the way for Venezuela to meet its obligation to pay Maduro's defense costs.\n\nThe lawyer added that Maduro “cannot otherwise afford counsel\" and will request help from the judge to pay for his defense.\n\nPollack said the United States was “interfering with Mr. Maduro's ability to retain counsel and, therefore, his right under the Sixth Amendment to counsel of his choice.”\n\nGoodman reported from Miami. Associated Press writers Aamer Madhani and Fatima Hussein in Washington and Larry Neumeister in New York contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "The MAGAverse was outraged early in President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday evening by what they perceived as an insult to the U.S. men’s hockey team.\n\nMany attendees stood and cheered loudly, applauding the Olympic gold medalists; chants of “USA! USA!” rang out as the athletes entered.\n\nSome of the president’s supporters online were quick to note, however, that not everybody in attendance stood to applaud, with several rushing to point the finger at Democrats, including the president himself.\n\n“That’s the first time I’ve ever seen [The Democrats] get up,” Trump joked, adding, “And actually, not all of them did get up.”\n\nSeveral Democrats in the chamber stood to applaud the hockey players, though some remained seated; others initially stood before sitting down as the cheering continued.\n\nDuring his speech, the president announced that Winnipeg Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He did not mention whether other players would also be receiving the honor.\n\nPopular MAGA X account End Wokeness posted a clip of the moment, pointing out the location of Democratic lawmakers in the chamber and noting that they “refused to stand” for the hockey team.\n\nOthers quickly adopted the same narrative, with Outkick founder Clay Travis writing, “This is wild, many Democrats have such Trump derangement syndrome that they refused to stand and clap for the US gold medal hockey team.”\n\nThe Federalist co-founder Sean Davis also noted the lack of applause, while senior Trump adviser Jason Miller responded to his post and called the Democrats in question, “Terrible human beings. Really pathetic.”\n\nFormer press secretary for President George W. Bush, Ari Fleischer, noted that the hockey players were positioned among reporters, writing on X, “I love the contrast of the USA chanting hockey team in the middle of the of the (sic) press gallery where of course the press are not supposed to cheer or take sides. What a look.”\n\nNewsBusters’ Curtis Houck responded to Fleischer’s post, calling reporters who didn’t clap “extremely out of touch.”\n\nThe men’s hockey team’s visit to Washington D.C. following their gold medal win in Milan on Sunday has caused significant controversy, with many fans criticizing the players for partying with FBI Director Kash Patel immediately following the game and laughing at a joke Trump made at the expense of the U.S. women’s hockey team, which also walked away with gold.\n\nDuring a phone call with the team in the locker room, Trump joked, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that.”\n\n“I think if I didn’t do that, I do believe I probably would be impeached,” he added. Several players could be seen laughing uproariously in response. The president also invited the players to D.C. for the State of the Union and a visit to the White House during the call.\n\nWhile the women’s team declined the president’s invitation, citing previously scheduled commitments, the majority of the men’s team attended, meeting with the president at the White House prior to the State of the Union and even offering him a chance to handle their Olympic medals despite his history of coveting other people’s awards.\n\n“Yeah, I’ll put it on,” Trump said when Matthew Tkachuk offered him his gold medal. “And I’m not giving it back.”\n\nPlayers who did not visit the White House with their teammates included Brock Nelson, Kyle Connor, Jackson LaCombe, Jake Oettinger and Jake Guentzel. In addition, captain Auston Matthews and Clayton Keller, both of whom visited the White House, did not attend the State of the Union.\n\nGuentzel was given permission by his team, the Tampa Bay Lightning, to attend, but chose to return home instead, while Winnipeg Jets player Kyle Connor told reporters he opted out in order to prepare for the team’s game on Wednesday.",

That's being overshadowed by a quick lapse.\n\n\"The guys were in a tough spot, so I think it's a shame this storyline and narrative has kind of blown up and [is] overshadowing that connection and genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on.\"\n\nKnight, 36, ended her Olympic career with 15 goals, the most by any US male or female player.\n\nShe said she hopes the Trump controversy proves to be a \"really good learning point, to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry\".\n\nShe said: \"Women aren't less than, and their achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"",

PAUL, Minn. — Players from the U.S. women’s Olympic hockey team said Wednesday that they felt love and support from the men’s team throughout their road to a gold medal in Milan, and that’s what they’ll remember — not the laugh some players had when U.S. President Donald Trump joked that he’d be impeached if he didn’t invite the women’s team to the White House.\n\n“I can’t wait ’til this blows over in a week and we can go back to each team being proud of what we accomplished. And proud of each other,” Minnesota Frost forward Taylor Heise told The Athletic after Frost practice.\n\nIn a video posted on social media, Trump called into the men’s locker room to congratulate players after their overtime win over Canada on Sunday. On speaker phone from what appeared to be FBI Director Kash Patel’s cellphone, Trump said, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team. You do know that.”\n\nHeise said she didn’t know if the begrudging invite registered with the euphoric players, pointing out that she could hear Dylan Larkin and Brock Nelson yell, “Two for two,” and Matthew Tkachuk say excitedly, “Absolutely,” before Trump dropped the impeachment quip.\n\nYou can hear the genuine pride in Donald Trumps voice when he called the Team USA Hockey Team pic.twitter.com/ch6GbXShwh\n\n— Harrison Krank (@HarrisonKrank) February 23, 2026\n\n“Keep in mind the situation and the emotions that they’re going through in the locker room,” gold medalist and Frost forward Britta Curl-Salemme said. “I remember our locker room after, you’re laughing at anything, you know what I mean?\n\n“Obviously, is that the perfect response? Is it an appropriate comment or joke to make? No, I don’t think so. But I just go back to the way that they treated us, and the support they gave us, and they were as happy as anyone to see us succeed, and same with us for them. That’s what I’m focusing more on. … I didn’t meet a single one of them that wasn’t very kind.”\n\nAdded Frost forward Grace Zumwinkle, “They came to a lot of our games, and we went to a lot of theirs. And I think there was that mutual level of respect, and it was evident with Ellen Hughes also being on our staff as well, and her two sons (Quinn and Jack) being on the (men’s) team. So, yes, we did feel the respect, and then just having been in the Village with them, as well, was a good experience.”\n\nHeise said many of the men’s players have called and texted apologies over the past few days — and to reiterate their support for the women’s team and how proud they were of them.\n\n“A lot of us are more concerned with what was said prior to the laugh, and I think that is what it is,” Heise told The Athletic. “Now everyone’s been making everything political, and obviously we’d love to keep politics out of sports, but I think that we felt the love from them and we don’t want this to fully overshadow our win. I do think partially that it did, and that’s unfortunate, but at the end of the day, we’re still gold-medal winners.”\n\nAdded two-time gold medalist and Frost forward Kelly Pannek, “Our experiences with the men’s team was different (than what’s been portrayed), I think. We all know being there what it felt like to have their support throughout the tournament, to support them, and how great of a moment it was for everyone that was a fan of both teams, to come together and say how great it was that we both won a gold medal for the first time ever.\n\n“And it really was such a special feeling being there and even to be able to spend some time with them after their win, and the respect that they were showing us. And I think the video is what it is. You’d have to ask them, I think, their feelings on it, but I think there’s also elements to it with the phone call, specifically — it’s not surprising, to be frank. So I don’t know why we expect differently, but I think for us, it’s also just about getting back to the focus on our team and what our team accomplished, and that was, I think, dominant hockey.”\n\nU.S. women’s team captain Hilary Knight, speaking at a Seattle Torrent news conference on Wednesday, told reporters: “I just thought the joke was distasteful and unfortunate. I think the way women are represented, it’s a great teaching point to really shine light on how women should be championed for their amazing feats. And now I have to sit in front of you and explain someone else’s behavior. It’s not my responsibility.”\n\nKnight added that she is “extremely proud” of the fact that the U.S. men’s and women’s teams both won Olympic gold.\n\n“But these women are amazing,” she said. “And whatever’s going on should never outshine or minimize their work and our success on the world’s stage.”\n\nWhen the U.S. women returned to the Olympic Village at 4 a.m. after beating Canada in their gold-medal game, Frost players said the men’s team — already asleep ahead of its semifinal the next day — had left them beer so they could celebrate. And after the women’s team returned from the closing ceremony after the men won Sunday, Heise recalled getting big hugs from Larkin, Auston Matthews and Charlie McAvoy.\n\nPlayers from both teams hung out in the Village afterward.\n\n“We sat there and reminisced on what it meant to be gold medalists at the Olympics,” Heise said. “At the end of the day, I respect the men’s team.”\n\nOn Tuesday, 20 of the 25 men’s players traveled to Washington, D.C., to have lunch with President Trump, visiting with him in the Oval Office and touring the White House. In the evening, many of the players attended the start of the president’s State of the Union address to be recognized. Trump announced that goalie Connor Hellebuyck would receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom — one of the two highest civilian awards in the United States.\n\nThe women’s team was also invited, but USA Hockey announced Monday that the players couldn’t go because of logistics. As Pannek said Wednesday, the women’s team was in Milan significantly longer than the men’s team and had already departed. Players were on their way back or already back with their college and PWHL teams.\n\nDuring the State of the Union, Trump said the women’s team “will soon be coming to the White House.”\n\n“Players are back competing with their professional and collegiate teams and are in the midst of their season,” USA Hockey said in a statement Wednesday. “They’re honored and grateful to be invited and any opportunity to visit the White House as a team will be based on their schedule once their seasons conclude.”\n\nThe Frost players didn’t seem to be aware of an official agreement for the women’s team to visit the White House. Pannek said, “I do know that there’ll be a time that all Team USA athletes will be invited, as there has been in the past.”\n\nHeise said whether or not the team attends will be up to Knight as captain.\n\n“Whatever Hilary says, we’ll figure out,” Heise said. “If she makes a statement, then we’ll follow what she has to say.”\n\nJeremy Swayman on the reaction to the postgame call with President Trump:\n\n“We should’ve reacted differently. We’re so excited for the Women’s team and have so much respect for the Women’s team.” pic.twitter.com/NLJmk7wlE5\n\n— Evan Marinofsky (@EvanMarinofsky) February 25, 2026\n\nRegardless, the players seem ready for the controversy with the men’s team to be over and done with.\n\n“I think that I would love to talk more about how great our team was — how close we were, how special the group was, how historic what we accomplished was,” Pannek said. “Those are all the things that I’d rather highlight versus things that are outside of our control.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nMinnesota Wild, Minnesota Frost, Seattle Torrent, NHL, Olympics, Men's Olympic Ice Hockey, Women's Olympic Ice Hockey, Women's Hockey, Olympics\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "President Donald Trump urged tech giants to create their own power sources for data centers. Big Tech is already shifting to private energy solutions.",
    "fullText": "The AI data center boom has triggered a dramatic spike in electricity costs, and President Donald Trump has a plan to stop it.\n\nTo do this, Trump said at Tuesday's State of the Union address that he issued a mandate for data centers to build their own power plants.\n\nTrump said he'd \"negotiated\" a ratepayer protection pledge with major technology companies and billed it as a unique solution to Big Tech's mounting power demand that would also protect American consumers from higher electricity bills.\n\n\"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory,\" Trump said.\n\nMany data center sites have already started building their own power plants. The vast majority of this buildout will initially run on fossil fuels, despite tech giants' clean energy commitments.\n\nWhen reached for comment on Wednesday morning, a White House spokesperson gave the following statement: \"Major Tech companies will join President Trump at the White House next week to formally sign the Rate Payer Protection Pledge that he announced during his historic State of the Union address. Under this bold initiative, these massive companies will build, bring, or buy their own power supply for new AI data centers, ensuring that Americans' electricity bills will not increase as demand grows. President Trump is committed to ensuring American AI dominance while simultaneously lowering costs for working families.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon confirmed to Business Insider that it will attend the White House next week.\n\n\"The Ratepayer Protection Pledge is an important step. We appreciate the Administration's work to ensure that data centers don't contribute to higher electricity prices for consumers,\" Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Anthropic referred Business Insider to a post on X made last night by Sarah Heck, the company's head of external affairs.\n\n\"American families shouldn't pick up the tab for AI. In support of the @WhiteHouse ratepayer protection pledge, Anthropic has committed to covering 100% of electricity price increases that consumers face from data centers,\" Heck wrote.\n\nMicrosoft, Anthropic, and OpenAI have previously announced commitments to covering the costs of electricity consumption at their data centers, though details on those plans remain scant.\n\nIn the last year, on-site power plants fueled mostly by natural gas have emerged as a key strategy for data center developers looking to stay ahead in the AI race. Meanwhile, US power demand has reached record highs.\n\nUtilities in the US last year asked state regulators to approve $31 billion in rate increases, more than double the amount sought in 2024, according to research from PowerLines, a nonprofit advocate for utility customers. Many of those requests occurred in places experiencing heavy data center development, such as Virginia, Texas, Utah, and North Carolina.\n\nTrump has framed data center developers building their own power plants as part of his broader promise to ensure that Big Tech pays for the infrastructure needed to power AI ambitions. For developers, building an on-site power plant can bypass long wait times for a grid connection.\n\nElon Musk's xAI is the most prominent example of this. Musk has drawn intense scrutiny in Tennessee and Mississippi, where he has deployed unpermitted mobile generators to quickly get his data centers up and running.\n\nMusk brought his first mobile generators to Memphis in 2024. In the US, dozens of data centers — about 30% of all planned data center capacity in the nation — plan to build their own power plants, according to a report issued this month from Cleanview, a data visualization software company that tracks clean energy and data center projects. Nearly all of that planned capacity — 90% — was added in 2025, Cleanview found.\n\nIn a review of permit documents, corporate filings, press releases, and local news stories, Cleanview identified 46 data center projects, many of them already under construction, that plan to draw power \"behind the meter\" by building on-site, private power plants that don't need a grid connection or service from the local utility to run.\n\nThese include Meta's plans to build an on-site natural gas plant for its data center in New Albany, Ohio, as well as Oracle and OpenAI's plans to power their Project Jupiter data center site in New Mexico with two massive natural gas-fired systems.\n\nWhile Big Tech companies often tout their commitments to clean energy, Cleanview's review of behind-the-meter permit documents found that natural gas powered 75% of all equipment listed.\n\nTech companies have said they want to power AI with clean technology, such as small modular nuclear reactors and geothermal energy. Much of it is still years away from being deployed at scale.\n\nCleanview found that more than one-third of the behind-the-meter buildout is happening in Texas, which could soon overtake Virginia as the data center capital of the world.\n\nBusiness Insider has reported on Oracle and OpenAI's plan to power Stargate data centers in Texas with on-site natural gas plants, as well as Fermi America's pitch to build the world's largest combined data center and power plant in the state's Panhandle region.\n\nAfter Texas, the top five states with the most planned behind-the-meter capacity are New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wyoming. West Virginia, Tennessee, Ohio, Virginia, and North Carolina also have significant behind-the-meter projects.\n\nHave a tip for this reporter?

    "fullText": "Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman (D) condemned the “yelling and screaming” from some Democratic legislators during President Trump’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t care if it’s a Republican or Democrat, it’s a president. Just don’t do that,” Fetterman told Fox News’s Bill Hemmer early Wednesday.\n\nSome Democrats heckled the president during his remarks, and Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) was removed from the House chamber for the second year in a row for protesting Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Democrats received flak from the White House for remaining seated and refusing to applaud through most of Trump’s speech before Congress.\n\nTrump criticized Democratic lawmakers during his speech for not rising to applaud his declaration that “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens.”\n\n“You should be ashamed of yourself, not standing up,” Trump said, directing his comments to the Democratic side of the chamber.\n\nFetterman, who has sided with Republicans on several hot-button issues, shook the president’s hand as he entered the floor Tuesday evening. The senator told Fox he believes he was the only Democrat to do so.\n\n“Yes, I shook his hand, of course,” Fetterman said. “He walked in, and I’m always going to do that, for sure.”\n\nThe Democratic senator previously warned members of his party against disrupting the president’s speech, telling Fox News’s Jesse Watters last week there is “just no dignity” in these actions.\n\nFetterman also expressed his disapproval on Wednesday for counterprogramming events during the president’s remarks, including the “People’s State of the Union” on the National Mall and “State of the Swamp” at the National Press Club.\n\n“It’s disappointing, honestly,” Fetterman said. “I mean, I think that’s sad that half of my colleagues didn’t show up.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said Wednesday that two Muslim Democratic U.S. Representatives, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, should be \"institutionalized\" and sent back to \"where ‌they came from,\" a day after they had a heated exchange with him during his State ‌of the Union address.\n\nDuring Trump's speech on Tuesday, Tlaib, a Palestinian American, and Omar, a Somali American, criticized Trump as he touted his ​administration's hard-line immigration crackdown and its immigration enforcement actions.\n\nBoth Omar and Tlaib shouted \"you're killing Americans\" at Trump during his speech, with Omar also calling him a \"liar.\"\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump said the two lawmakers \"had the bulging, bloodshot eyes of crazy people, LUNATICS, mentally deranged and sick who, frankly, look like they should be institutionalized.\"\n\n\"We should send ‌them back from where they came — as ⁠fast as possible,\" Trump added. Both Omar and Tlaib are U.S. citizens.\n\nHouse of Representatives Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries cast Trump's rhetoric against Tlaib and Omar as \"xenophobic\" and \"disgraceful.\" Tlaib said on ⁠X that Trump's comments showed \"he is crashing out.\"\n\nMuslim advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations also said Trump's comments were racist.\n\n\"It's racist and bigoted to say two Muslim U.S. lawmakers should be sent to the country they were born in or ​where their ​ancestors came from based on their criticism of the gunning ​down of Americans by ICE,\" CAIR National Deputy ‌Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that members of the media have \"smeared\" the president as a racist.\n\nTrump's immigration enforcement actions were criticized following two separate January fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minnesota. At least eight people have died in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers since the start of 2026, following at ‌least 31 deaths last year.\n\nDuring his Tuesday speech, Trump reiterated his ​accusation that Somali communities in the U.S. have engaged in fraud ​and claimed that \"Somali pirates\" had ransacked Minnesota. His ​administration had used fraud allegations to deploy armed federal immigration agents in Minnesota.\n\nTrump has cast ‌his actions as aiming to tackle fraud and ​improve domestic security.\n\nRights groups say ​the crackdown has created a fearful environment and that Trump has used isolated fraud cases as an excuse to target immigrants. They also dismiss Trump's ability to tackle fraud, citing pardons from him to ​those who have faced fraud convictions in ‌the past.\n\nTrump also recently faced criticism after his social media account posted a video that contained ​a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama.",

    "fullText": "The public opinion regarding Donald Trump’s State of the Union address has finally come to light, with a poll revealing how the President’s speech fared in front of his audience. His addresses to Congress largely fetched favorable remarks from speech-watchers, arguably due to the spectators’ pool having 13 percentage points more Republican viewers than normal. However, despite having a more friendly audience, Trump’s speech drew its fair share of criticism, especially regarding his take on the cost of living.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 24, the two-time US President gave the second State of the Union address of his political career, ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nA CNN poll conducted by SSRS during the event divulged that approximately two-thirds of the audience present gave a somewhat favorable reaction to Donald Trump’s speech, with 38% giving it an extremely positive rating. This response is actually better than the points he scored during his address to Congress last year, but pales in comparison to the ratings of his first-term speeches.\n\nBefore Trump’s address, an estimated 54% of speech-watchers agreed that his policies would benefit the nation. After his speech, the CNN poll revealed that the percentage had risen to 64%. Similarly, a healthy 44% believed that the businessman-turned-politician was focusing on the right issues before the address, with the number jumping to 54% afterwards.\n\nHowever, a whopping 45% of the Republican-dominated audience admitted that Trump was giving too little attention to the cost of living after hearing what he had to say. Moreover, 40% relayed that they had no confidence that the President would make things more affordable.\n\nAdditionally, according to the poll, listeners were evenly split on Donald Trump’s actions regarding tariffs. His economic and immigration policies garnered a much better response, with 62% agreeing that his strategies are in line with the nation’s best interest.\n\nMeanwhile, 45% expressed full faith in Trump’s leadership, with 43% backing the 79-year-old politician for using US military power responsibly. As for his stance on Iran, 38% noted that he would be able to deal with the situation appropriately.\n\nDespite the overall positive response in the poll, Donald Trump’s State of the Union address should do little to sway public opinion in his favor, given that the speech-watchers mostly consisted of people who already resonate with his ideologies.\n\nNotably, in another CNN poll conducted a few days before Trump’s speech, his approval rating stood at a meager 36%.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s Poll After State of the Union Revealed appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump delivered his annual address to Congress on Tuesday in what was the longest State of the Union in US history.\n\nThe two-hour remarks were light on new policy but heavy on familiar themes, including tariffs, lower consumer prices, and immigration.\n\nTrump also said that AI data centers could drive up utility bills and said tech companies should shoulder their own power needs.\n\nEconomists and business leaders are already weighing in on what he said — and what he didn't.\n\nHere is how some of the most prominent voices reacted:\n\nPaul Krugman framed the address as historically long and riddled with distortions, saying that Trump tried to paint an overly rosy picture despite affordability pressures that many households still feel.\n\nIn a Substack post headlined \"A SOTU Like No Other,\" Krugman described the speech as \"so little truth, so much time.\"\n\nHe said Trump failed to seriously grapple with the affordability problems he thinks are driving public pessimism — while \"doubling down\" on tariffs that he said would make those pressures worse.\n\n\"Was the plan to turn public opinion around by boring America into submission?\" he asked.\n\nIan Bremmer focused less on policy specifics and more on the atmosphere in the chamber, calling it a reflection of broader national polarization.\n\n\"Completely divided chamber of Congress reflecting a completely divided United States,\" Bremmer wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked if any of it was new, he later added, \"new? hardly. worse? absolutely.\"\n\nBill Ackman praised Trump's retirement-savings proposal — a federal savings plan modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan, with an annual government match of up to $1,000 — calling it one of the speech's most significant policy moments.\n\nAckman said that 46 million working Americans don't have a 401(k), pension, or similar plan, and said that a federally matched account could expand household wealth-building and reduce reliance on welfare programs over time.\n\nHe also predicted expanding the match could become a rare bipartisan win, writing: \"This is an amazing initiative for our country.\"\n\nPeter Schiff said that Trump's first-year inflation performance wasn't meaningfully better than former President Joe Biden's and predicted it could worsen.\n\n\"We may have changed presidents, but inflation remains the same,\" Schiff wrote on X, pointing to the consumer price index rising by 2.7% in Trump's first year versus 2.9% in Biden's last year.\n\nHe said that CPI would \"likely rise by more than 3%\" in Trump's second year.\n\n\"We may have changed presidents, but inflation remains the same,\" he added.\n\nRoger Altman said the president pulled a \"classic Trump\" and \"put on a show,\" but delivered a speech unlikely to move weak economic approval numbers.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, he said Trump described an economy that was \"roaring and couldn't be better,\" but said there's a \"disconnect\" because many Americans — especially lower-income households — \"are having a hard time.\"\n\nEven so, Altman struck a more upbeat tone on fundamentals, forecasting 2.5% to 2.75% growth, cooling inflation, and real wage gains as inflation ticks toward the Fed's 2% target.\n\nOn trade, he warned tariffs may stick around: The revenue impact is so significant that it would be \"hard\" for either party to walk away from them, he said.",

    "title": "Goldman Sachs' top DEI executive exits for rival as Wall Street retreats from diversity under the Trump administration",
    "description": "Megan Hogan, a high-profile voice on Goldman's social impact initiatives, is headed to Morgan Stanley this spring, Business Insider has learned.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' top diversity official has left for a rival in recent weeks, multiple people familiar with the matter told Business Insider. Her exit comes as Wall Street retreats from long-stated DEI pledges about hiring and career advancement.\n\nMegan Hogan, Goldman's global co-head of talent left in January for Morgan Stanley, several people familiar with the matter said. Hogan, who joined the firm nearly 12 years ago, held the title of chief diversity officer until early 2025 before taking on the broader talent position for the past year.\n\nHogan confirmed the move via email on Tuesday, telling Business Insider that Morgan Stanley had extended her \"an amazing opportunity\" in talent development, which will begin when her garden leave expires. She declined to comment further.\n\nAt Morgan Stanley, Hogan will serve as head of talent development, reporting to Susan Reid, the firm's global head of talent. Hogan will begin in April, a person familiar with the hire said.\n\nLike other Wall Street banks, Goldman Sachs spent years investing in workforce diversity initiatives, and Hogan was one of its most prominent faces focused on social impact issues. But when President Donald Trump returned to power last January, he issued an executive order ending DEI programming at government agencies and urging companies to follow suit. Goldman, like many of its peers, has since taken steps to scrub DEI language from public-facing materials.\n\nEarlier this month, the bank also agreed to remove race, gender identity, and sexual orientation from its board-member selection criteria following pressure from a conservative shareholder group, the Wall Street Journal reported. It also stopped highlighting specific DEI targets in annual reports, a practice that had been a staple of its post-2020 communications, and said it would sunset the \"aspirational hiring goals\" it established half a decade ago.\n\n\"This is a reflection of the changing legal environment and adapting to the reality of those legal shifts,\" a spokesperson for the bank told Business Insider, adding that the firm stands by the benefit of \"diverse perspectives and experiences,\" and is following the law while running programs designed to \"attract the best talent.\"\n\nLater this week, the bank is expected to name Lauren Uranker, another managing director who joined the firm about 14 years ago, as the new sole head of talent development, engagement, and management, according to a person with close knowledge of the bank's thinking. Uranker was appointed global co-head of talent alongside Hogan in mid-2025.\n\nIn her new position, Uranker's mandate is expected to concentrate on the transition to AI-supported work, team growth, and finding ways to engage and retain top employees. Her title has no direct references to DEI, but the position will still encompass programming designed to advance workplace inclusion, the source added.\n\nCorporate America — including financial services firms such as JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley— has eased use of the term \"DEI\" and associated language since early 2025. The Trump administration's rebuke of diversity-related programming continues to serve as a point of pride for Trump, who touted the crackdown during his State of the Union address to lawmakers on Tuesday night. \"We ended DEI in America,\" he said.\n\nGoldman had previously been among Wall Street's most vocal advocates for promoting inclusion in the workplace. In 2020, David Solomon, the bank's CEO, championed a series of policies like requiring companies to appoint diverse board members before his bankers would agree to help them go public — a rule the company killed last year. Stephanie Cohen, the bank's former chief strategy officer who departed in 2024, told Business Insider in 2020 that Goldman viewed these issues as more than perfunctory but vital for commercial success.\n\nHogan's predecessor, Erika Irish Brown, left for Citi in 2021 to lead DEI efforts there. Following Brown's departure, Hogan — who previously held the titles of head of Americas talent management and global head of diversity recruiting — assumed the chief diversity officer title the same year, but last year consolidated primarily on her \"global co-head of talent\" designation. Her exit compounds another long-standing struggle for the Wall Street bank: retaining senior female leaders. Goldman has faced blowback over whether it's done enough to support their career progress — an area where officials have acknowledged there's room for improvement.\n\nThough the firm has increased the total share of female managing directors by 3% since 2021, a spokesperson said, Solomon acknowledged this past fall that there was further to go. \"We've made a bunch of progress, especially in the senior ranks,\" he said at the Economic Club of Washington in October. But the results, he added, were \"candidly not enough, and we continue to be focused on creating opportunities.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Trump revealed details of the US raid into Venezuela while awarding the Medal of Honor to an Army pilot.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump shared vivid details Tuesday night of the firefight that erupted as an American helicopter reached Nicolás Maduro's compound during the US raid into Venezuela last month.\n\nAs the Chinook helicopter carrying elite US ground troops and piloted by Chief Warrant Officer 5 Eric Slover approached what the president had previously described as a fortress, \"enemy machine guns fired from every angle,\" Trump said during his State of the Union Address.\n\n\"Eric was hit very badly in the leg and hip,\" the president said as he awarded the military's top valor award, the Congressional Medal of Honor, to Slover.\n\nImmediately following the January 3 raid to capture the then-president of Venezuela, Trump said that a helicopter got hit \"pretty hard\" and that \"a couple of guys were hit.\" Official details of the injuries were limited. His speech on Tuesday shed new light on what happened that night.\n\nAfter numerous American warplanes, including advanced stealth fighters, suppressed Venezuela's air defense network, helicopters carrying ground troops moved in, approaching Maduro's fortified compound.\n\nSlover's helicopter encountered \"two machine gunners who escaped the wrath of the previous planes,\" Trump said. As the bullets hit the aircraft, Slover \"absorbed four agonizing shots, shredding his leg into numerous pieces,\" he continued. \"He was gushing blood.\"\n\nHelicopter pilots rely on both a control stick and floor pedals for maneuvering. Most helicopters have one main rotor and a small tail rotor to keep them from spinning, but a Chinook has two large rotors that balance each other.\n\nDespite his serious wounds, Slover managed to maneuver his helicopter into position so that onboard gunners could \"take care of business\" and \"eliminate the threat,\" the president said, crediting Slover with \"saving the lives of his fellow warriors from what could have been a catastrophic crash, deep in enemy territory.\"\n\nAfter landing, Slover told his co-pilot, who was also wounded but not as gravely, to \"take over,\" saying, \"I'm about ready to pass out.\" A total of seven US troops were injured during the raid.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address, Trump also presented a second Medal of Honor to centenarian US Navy pilot E. Royce Williams, a veteran of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.\n\nThree years ago, Williams was awarded the Navy Cross for \"extraordinary heroism\" in a Korean War air battle in which he was outgunned and outmatched in his F9F Panther by Soviet MiG-15 fighters but still managed to shoot down four of them.\n\nThe 1952 dogfight was classified for decades.\n\nThe Congressional Medal of Honor is usually awarded in solemn, less politically charged ceremonies at the White House. The award can take years, or even decades, as was the case for Williams, to be bestowed. It requires eyewitness accounts and has strict criteria. Other valor awards, such as the Navy Cross or Silver Star, can occasionally be upgraded to a Medal of Honor, a notoriously lengthy process.\n\nThe top award is bestowed upon troops engaged against an enemy of the US or an \"opposing foreign force,\" according to the military's awards manual.\n\nThat the medal was awarded during the State of the Union elicited reactions from some veterans online who felt that the timing dampened the gravity of the award's significance.\n\nDuring the event, Trump reiterated his previously stated desire to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\n\"I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I was informed, I'm not allowed to give it to myself,\" Trump told the crowd. \"I wouldn't know why I'd be taking it, but if they ever open up that law, I will be there with you someday.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump urged Congress during his State of the Union address on Tuesday to pass a bill banning congressional stock trading, prompting a rare moment of Democratic applause by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and her peers.\n\n“Let’s also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information,” Trump told the crowd of lawmakers, which later erupted into applause.\n\nThe bipartisan praise appeared to surprise Trump, who scanned the Democratic side of the House chamber.\n\n“Did Nancy Pelosi stand up?” he quipped. “Doubt it.”\n\nTrump appeared to refer to Pelosi’s family’s extensive stock portfolio amassed during her decades in Congress, which has spurred allegations of insider trading. Pelosi has denied the allegations and endorsed a ban on congressional stock trading in 2022.\n\nTrump urged Congress to pass the Stop Insider Trading Act, which was introduced in the House last month, “without delay.” The bill has stalled in the House after dozens of Republicans refused to support it, according to Politico, while Democrats have called for a broader bill that also applies to the executive branch.\n\nTrump: Let's also ensure that members of congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information… They stood up for that. I can’t believe it. Did Nancy Pelosi stand up if she’s here? I doubt it. pic.twitter.com/HsYfMwcO5H\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) February 25, 2026\n\nWarren has been a longtime advocate for banning congressional stock trading, saying in a video last year that such a ban was “long overdue.”\n\n“No one in this country should wonder whether or not their senator, their representative, and president is making a decision that is good for the country. Or maybe just good for their own private pocketbook,” Warren said in the clip posted to her X account.\n\nStill, some Democrats heckled Trump as he called for the ban. “How about you first!” Rep.

    "description": "Gianni Infantino has clashed with unions and European football, but after 10 years as Fifa president he remains in an impregnable position.",
    "fullText": "It is 10 years since Gianni Infantino was elected Fifa president, with a remit to rescue football's world governing body.\n\nThe decade since has been one of reform, expansion and, more recently, controversy.\n\nInfantino was installed with Fifa engulfed by claims of widespread corruption and after predecessor Sepp Blatter had resigned.\n\nFifa's finances were in a desperate state. There was a reported $550m (£392m) black hole, external after sponsors walked away.\n\nIn Infantino, the game felt it had found a safe pair of hands.\n\n\"I will work tirelessly to bring football back to Fifa, and Fifa back to football,\" Infantino said.\n\nTen years on, there can be no doubt the governing body is in rude health. It expects to report record revenues, external of $13bn (£9.6bn) for the three-year cycle through to the end of this year.\n\nBut those figures only tell part of the story.\n\nThey are boosted by the controversial Club World Cup, and the biggest-ever World Cup with its high ticket prices.\n\nInfantino has clashed with players' unions and European football, but he remains in an impregnable position at the top of the world game.\n\nThis is the story of his presidency and his legacy.\n\nIt is easy to forget Blatter's successor as Fifa president was supposed to be Michel Platini.\n\nBut after Platini was drawn into the scandal at the organisation - both he and Blatter were later fully cleared of corruption charges - Infantino was thrust forward as Uefa's preferred candidate.\n\nAs the general secretary of European football's governing body, Infantino had been the right-hand man of president Platini for seven years.\n\nBut he was an unlikely saviour - a man who was rarely in the consciousness of the average football fan.\n\nTo many he was just the guy who presented Champions League draws.\n\nTen years on, you would be hard pressed to find a football fan who does not recognise him.\n\nTurning Fifa around was no small task.\n\nThe US Department of Justice had indicted a large number of top executives and it needed root-and-branch reform.\n\nTwo pages of Infantino's manifesto were devoted to more than doubling development money for member associations.\n\nThat would be for new competitions, for infrastructure, and even to cover travel costs for smaller nations.\n\nExpanding the World Cup was also included, though to 40 teams. Within a year it had been rubberstamped as a 48-team tournament.\n\nThe election was a close-run thing.\n\nIn the first round of votes, Infantino led Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa - president of the Asian confederation - by 88 votes to 85.\n\nInfantino only moved clear when the 34 votes originally cast for Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein and French executive Jerome Champagne were reallocated.\n\nThe final score was 115 votes to 88.\n\n\"This is a new day, a new dawn,\" said then Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, welcoming Infantino's win. \"He is not a politician and he is not an ego.\"\n\nInfantino, meanwhile, declared he would \"restore the image of Fifa\".\n\n\"It's your money, not the money of the Fifa president,\" Infantino told delegates. \"The money of Fifa has to be used to develop football.\"\n\nInfantino was true to his word. But to make more money, Fifa had to be creative.\n\nThe controversial World Cups of 2018 in Russia and 2022 in Qatar were waiting in Infantino's in-tray.\n\nIn his early years as president, Infantino kept a fairly low profile. It was only when the World Cup rolled into Qatar that he started to become a more public figure.\n\nUnder pressure amid repeated criticisms about workers' rights and claims of modern slavery in the country, Infantino hit back.\n\nHe first called out \"hypocrisy\" and \"racism\" about Qatar in the European media, then made his infamous speech about discrimination.\n\n\"Today I feel Qatari,\" he said. \"Today I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel like a migrant worker.\"\n\nAt every game he attended, TV cameras appeared to pick him out in the crowd.\n\nAnd there was a reason. Reports, which Fifa declined to comment on, suggested television directors were advised that Infantino should be shown at least once each game, but not if he was on his phone., external\n\nFifa accused of breaching own rules with Trump award\n\nTrump and Infantino - too close for comfort?\n\nFifa accused of creating 'fake' player unions\n\nAfter the Qatar World Cup, Infantino made many more headlines - from hosting plans and new tournaments to disparaging remarks about the behaviour of England fans.\n\nInfantino had promised an expanded, summer Club World Cup shortly after his election in 2016.\n\nThe plan hit several delays but - two days before the 2022 World Cup final - Fifa eventually announced it would go ahead in 2025, hosted by the United States.\n\nIt placed a large-scale tournament in a summer which was usually reserved for player recovery.\n\nFifa rejected claims players' union' Fifpro and the World Leagues' Association were not consulted.\n\nThen came the unique allocation of the 2030 and 2034 World Cup finals.\n\nIt was decided the 2030 edition would be staged across three continents - Africa, Europe and South America. That meant the 2034 event had to go to Asia or Oceania.\n\nWith no realistic competition, it effectively guaranteed Saudi Arabia - another country with questions about its human rights record - would host.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Fifa, under Infantino, had developed a close relationship.\n\nNorway's football federation abstained from the process and argued the bidding process undermined \"Fifa's reforms for good governance\" and challenged \"trust in Fifa\".\n\nIn May 2024, it was revealed Infantino received a 33% pay rise, external upon his re-election the previous year.\n\nIt took his base salary from 1.95m Swiss francs (£1.7m) in 2022 to 2.6m Swiss francs (£2.3m).\n\nOn top of that, he was due a bonus of 1,650,000 Swiss francs (£1.5m), which was unchanged.\n\nInfantino, who was earning about £1.3m when first elected in 2016, is now close to Blatter's final annual salary payment of £2.6m., external\n\nHowever, a Fifa investigation showed that under Blatter leading executives were being paid huge bonuses running well into the millions., external\n\nIn November 2024, with the new-look Club World Cup drawing closer, Fifa unveiled the trophy - engraved with a personal tribute.\n\n\"Inspired by the Fifa president Gianni Infantino,\" it read.\n\nUefa was growing frustrated with Infantino's profile and his close relationship with US President Donald Trump.\n\nIt came to a head in May 2025. Infantino had been on a diplomatic tour of the Middle East with Trump and turned up two hours late for the Fifa Congress.\n\nUefa accused Infantino of prioritising \"private political interests\" and staged a walk-out.\n\nThen came last summer's Club World Cup, which was characterised by stadiums with swathes of empty seats.\n\nYet when Infantino gathered the media at Trump Tower, he declared it to be \"already the most successful club competition in the world\".\n\nIn December, the draw for this summer's World Cup was a long, lavish and outlandish affair.\n\nInfantino was front and centre, and Trump was awarded the controversial Fifa Peace Prize.\n\nWithin a week came the announcement of high ticket prices for the finals.\n\nGroup-stage tickets are up to three times the price of those for the 2022 World Cup, and the cheapest ticket for the final in New Jersey is £3,119.\n\nAfter a minor climbdown, Infantino defended the prices and said they reflected the public's \"absolutely crazy\" demand.\n\nInfantino insisted all the money would go back into the game, saying \"without Fifa there would be no football in 150 countries\".\n\nHe still had one more media mis-step to go before reaching his 10-year anniversary.\n\nEarlier this month he had to apologise after saying it was \"really special\" no British nationals were arrested during the 2022 World Cup.\n\nDespite the controversies, one fact remains: there is no meaningful opposition to Infantino.\n\nWhile the 55-year-old may face criticism in Europe, for the rest of the world he has made a clear difference. Yes, it is about money. But money for football.\n\nHe has enriched some of the poorest and smallest footballing nations, proving funding through infrastructure and development.\n\nInfantino has been true to his word that Fifa would be transparent - publishing the salaries of all top executives and keeping funds within football.\n\nThe Swiss delivered on his initial promise of an extra $5m (£3.7m) for every national association over the first four years, and $40m (£29.7m) for each confederation.\n\nAcross the first two cycles of the Fifa Forward project through to 2022, $2.8bn (£2.08bn) was made available for investment across the 211 member associations on more than 1,600 projects.\n\nFifa Forward 3.0, external - covering the years 2023 through to 2026 - has produced a 30% increase in funding.\n\nInfantino has provided a further $5m (£3.7m) for every member association, with another $60m (£44.48m) paid to each confederation for their own projects.\n\nAfter being re-elected unopposed in 2019 and 2023, he is approaching another election year in 2027.\n\nInfantino will be able to stand again, even though Fifa statues limit the president to a maximum of three terms.\n\nIn 2022 the governance, audit and compliance committee ruled his first term did not count, as it was only for three years.\n\nWith the way Infantino has improved the financial situation of so many associations, it is hard to see how anyone could realistically challenge him in 2027.\n\nAlmost half of the 211 votes are held by Asia and Africa - two regions that have benefited from the hugely increased finances.\n\nInfantino may be criticised for the way he has expanded the Club World Cup, and the World Cup, and the increased ticket prices.\n\nBut he sees it as a vehicle to increase investment in the game around the world.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address on Feb. 24, decrying the recent Supreme Court ruling against his tariff plan as \"very unfortunate\"\n\nThe diatribe came just days after Trump called the justices who voted down his tariff plan a \"disgrace to our nation\"\n\nOnly four of the nine Supreme Court justices were in attendance for the speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted the Supreme Court to their face during his State of the Union address following their recent ruling against his tariff plan.\n\nDuring his speech at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, Feb. 24, the president made several pointed remarks at the members of the Supreme Court. Only four justices were present — Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — but that didn't stop Trump from criticizing the court as a whole for their decision.\n\n\"It was an unfortunate ruling from the United States Supreme Court, a very unfortunate ruling,\" Trump said, while the four present justices sat in the front row.\n\nThe remarks come four days after the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to strike down one of Trump's most touted policies of his second term so far: import tariffs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last week that the president exceeded his authority when he imposed unprecedented tariffs on imports from almost every U.S. trading partner by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.\n\nHowever, as he did at the time of the ruling, Trump promised he had plans to keep the tariffs in place, just not by using IEEPA.\n\n\"Almost all countries and corporations want to keep the deal that they already made, knowing that the legal power that I have as president could be far worse for them,\" he said. \"Congressional action will not be necessary... We finally have a president who puts America first.\"\n\nTrump's April 2, 2025, announcement of his tariffs, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" declared the imposition of a 10% baseline duty on most imports to the U.S., with some nations navigating higher tariffs if they didn't participate in trade negotiations, Time reported. Many countries retaliated by increasing taxes on U.S. goods, causing the stock market to dive.\n\nThe morning the SCOTUS ruling was announced, striking that plan down, Trump was hosting a breakfast with governors from around the country.\n\nAlthough he dismissed members of the White House press corps from the room shortly after entering, CNN's Kaitlan Collins reported that, inside the closed-door meeting, the president called the Supreme Court ruling a \"disgrace\" and assured the gathered governors that \"he has a backup plan.\"\n\nLater in the day, Trump ultimately did address the press, calling the ruling \"deeply disappointing.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what's right for our country,\" Trump, 79, said. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there's no way that anyone can argue against them.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe president praised the three dissenting justices — Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — but called those who voted for the majority \"a disgrace to our nation.\"\n\nHe reserved his sharpest insults for Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — the two Trump appointees who voted against his tariffs — calling them \"an embarrassment to their families.”\n\n\"It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests,\" he continued. \"It's almost like [the decision was] written by not very smart people.\"\n\nFive of the nine Supreme Court justices skipped Trump's 2026 State of the Union address: Republican-appointed justices Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch, as well as Democrat-appointed justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump delivered his State of the Union address to a ‌joint session of Congress on Tuesday, a potentially pivotal moment ‌as the White House seeks to firm up support among Republican voters ahead of November's ​midterm elections.\n\nTrump's speech comes against a backdrop of rising tensions with Iran and voter frustration with the high cost of living.\n\nTrump put dollars and cents at the heart of his speech, but he stuck to a risky ‌message on the economy ⁠that some strategists have warned could lose his Republican Party the congressional elections in November, when all 435 seats ⁠in the House and about a third of the Senate are in play. Democrats hope to take control from Republicans who have a majority in ​both chambers.\n\nIn ​Trump’s telling, inflation, mortgage rates and ​gas prices are falling, while ‌the stock market, oil production and foreign direct investment are booming along with construction and factory jobs. But he stopped short of acknowledging the pain that Americans still feel from rising prices, as he has in most of his recent speeches on the subject.\n\nThe data shows inflation stalled and ‌even ticked up last year, and the ​economy lost factory jobs last year.\n\nVoters tell ​pollsters they are anxious about ​the economy and are dissatisfied with Trump’s handling of ‌the issue. Fifty-six percent disapprove of ​his handling of ​the economy, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, while 36% approve.\n\nThat’s a reality strategists say Trump needs to reckon with if he’s going to be ​Republicans' chief messenger on ‌the economy as they fight to keep control of Congress in ​November’s midterm elections.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump zeroed in on what he calls America's \"roaring economy.\"\n\nThe president gave his annual speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. He opened the event focused on his administration's economic agenda, especially inflation rates and consumer prices.\n\n\"I inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy,\" Trump told lawmakers, adding, \"A short time ago, we were a dead country. Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHere are the biggest notes on the economy from the speech.\n\nTrump said his administration has driven down inflation and mortgage rates, along with energy prices. He touted a strong stock market, and said the administration has \"lifted a record number of Americans off food stamps\" with their updated SNAP rules.\n\nHe blamed Democratic leaders for high inflation rates. \"Their policies created the high prices\" his administration was aiming to bring down, he said.\n\nThe consumer price index, a key measure of inflation, cooled slightly in January but remains about the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.\n\nThe president added that he and Republican allies delivered the \"largest tax cuts in American history\" in their latest budget bill, alongside promises to end taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security.\n\nHe did not introduce new tax policies early in the speech, but he did mention Trump Accounts, a newly-launched federal investment account for children that will be available in July.\n\nFor retirees, Trump announced a new plan to offer federal retirement matching contributions to Americans without employer-sponsored plans.\n\n\"My administration will give these oft-forgotten American workers, great people, the people that built our country, access to the same type of retirement plan offered to every federal worker. We will match your contribution with up to $1,000 each year,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he \"wants to stop all payments to big insurance companies.\" He underscored his \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums, implement cost-sharing programs, and increase cost transparency.\n\n\"I am also ending the wildly inflated cost of prescription drugs,\" he said. The Trump administration officially launched TrumpRx a few weeks ago, a direct-to-consumer prescription platform. The president spoke specifically about affordable IVF drugs.\n\nThe administration and Republican lawmakers opted not to renew enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies at the end of 2025. The credits helped lower-and middle-income families afford marketplace insurance coverage, and millions have dropped their plans so far due to skyrocketing 2026 premium costs.\n\nThe president said his administration is lowering housing prices.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nHe spoke about his January executive order to ban large Wall Street investment firms from buying single-family homes. \"Now I am asking Congress to make that ban permanent, because homes are for people, not corporations,\" he said.\n\nHousing market analysts told Business Insider that this policy is unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, typically in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nTrump also said his administration is boosting jobs in the construction sector, one of the few parts of the labor market alongside healthcare that has seen growth this year.\n\nThroughout his second term, the Trump administration has leaned into affordability issues, especially high prices on consumer goods. The White House has touted budget changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, tax breaks for middle- and higher-income Americans. In some cases, the president has reached across the aisle for economic priorities, like a long-time Democrat-backed policy to rein in credit card rates.\n\nAs for the job market, growth has been the lowest in decades aside from recessions, and Trump's Department of Government Efficiency took a sizable swing at the federal workforce. The administration hopes the pending appointment of former Wall Streeter Kevin Warsh to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be a path toward lower interest rates in 2026, which could juice hiring — at the risk of growing inflation.\n\nA YouGov and MarketWatch poll published February 24 found that 83% of Americans believe affordability has worsened or remained stagnant under Trump's second term.\n\nTrump is expected to speak for at least two hours this evening, covering topics like the Supreme Court tariff ruling, AI investment, immigration, and foreign policy.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump addressed the nation in front of Congress and touted his economic policies, including the tariffs that SCOTUS struck down.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump called the Supreme Court's decision that overturned his signature tariffs \"unfortunate\" during his State of the Union address.\n\nTrump addressed the nation several days after the Supreme Court ruled against most of his 2025 tariffs that were enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nDespite this setback to his economic agenda, which he touted on Tuesday, Trump said he wouldn't need to make new trade deals, even though he used the now-struck-down tariffs as his primary negotiating tool, because other countries were happy with the deals made so far.\n\nImmediately after the SCOTUS ruling, Trump signed an executive order to impose a 10% \"global tariff\" under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Unlike the IEEPA tariffs, any duties under Section 122 last 150 days before requiring congressional approval.\n\n\"They're a little more complex, but they're actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before. Congressional action will not be necessary,\" said Trump of his new 10% \"global tariffs\" at the State of the Union.\n\n\"It's already time-tested and approved, and as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love,\" Trump added.\n\nAccording to the Customs and Border Protection, the US has collected around $129 billion in revenue under the IEEPA tariffs. Companies large and small have now begun the messy process of litigating for tariff refunds, and some, like FedEx, have filed lawsuits at the Court of International Trade.\n\nRecent studies found that it was companies and consumers who pay for the majority of tariffs, including a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that said, \"90% of the tariffs' economic burden fell on US firms and consumers.\"\n\nThe landmark SCOTUS ruling was made at a time when concerns about affordability and economic health were widespread. Recent data shows that while the US economy grew 2.2% in 2025, job creation stalled. Economists previously told Business Insider that this pattern is widening the gap between the wealthy and everyone else.\n\nAccording to a February poll jointly conducted by ABC News, The Washington Post, and Ipsos, a majority of Americans disapprove of how the president is handling inflation, tariffs, relations with other countries, immigration, and the economy.\n\nAccording to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer sentiment survey, consumer confidence in February is more than 12% lower than in the same month in 2025.\n\nDana M Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board, commented in its February economic sentiment research that though consumers' pessimistic expectations for the future \"eased somewhat,\" confidence remains \"well below\" the four-year peak achieved in November 2024.",

A White House spokesperson confirmed the report to Business Insider but did not provide additional details.\n\nThe announcement comes as Big Tech companies spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI infrastructure and data centers, driving up electricity demand in the US. Utility costs are rising across the US as a result of the increased electricity demand for data centers, a report from the Center for American Progress found.\n\nTrump has previously said Americans should not have to pay higher electricity costs due to data centers, and that the companies that build them \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nDecisions about utility costs are typically made at the state and local levels. It's unclear how the newly announced pledges would be implemented.",

    "fullText": "Toying with a hypothetical on Tuesday’s “Behind the Table” podcast, “The View” co-host Joy Behar admitted she would bend her knee to President Trump if it meant getting her family out of jail – but only for a bit.\n\nIn conversation with executive produce Brian Teta, Behar touched on recent “The View” guest host Savannah Chrisley and her support for Trump. Chrisley has said she’s identified as Republican for a long time, but turned to Trump after her parents served two years in prison for tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy before he pardoned them.\n\nBehar said it is easy to be a Republican without supporting Trump, but she might also be pro-Trump if her family ever needed an out-of-jail card.\n\n“You can be a Republican and still be anti-Donald Trump,” Behar said. “He’s not a Republican. People are getting hip to that now. You see the polls, they’re going, everybody’s turning on him. He’s going to go out there tonight right behind the eight ball, and he knows it, too, which makes him more hyperbolic. He’ll be bragging about not only can he read, he can run, he can walk.”\n\nShe added after asked by Teta if she would support him for her family’s freedom like Chrisley: “I would do it, of course, for my family. But then I would trash him afterwards … But I don’t come from a family like that.”\n\nWatch the full “Behind the Table” interview below:\n\nAtlanta-based millionaire Todd Chrisley started out in real estate before pivoting to reality TV once the 2008 recession hit his company Chrisley Asset Management. Chrisley and his second wife Julie received a combined 19-year prison sentence for bank fraud and tax evasion in June 2022. Trump gave both a full pardon in May 2025. Savannah fought tirelessly for a presidential pardon to free her parents and even spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2024.\n\nA new Lifetime docuseries titled “The Chrisleys: Back to Reality” premiered in September 2025. It gave viewers an “unfiltered, deeply personal look” at the family’s journey and introduces the real Chrisleys as they navigate this new chapter.\n\nThe post Joy Behar Admits She Would Bend to Trump if He Could Get Her Family Out of Jail: ‘I Would Trash Him Afterwards’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Here's what it was like for one reporter to be in the room for the longest State of the Union in American history.",
    "fullText": "It ended up being the longest State of the Union speech in American history.\n\nI was one of over 100 reporters seated in the House chamber during President Donald Trump's address on Tuesday night, when the president shattered the record for the longest speech at just over 107 minutes.\n\nOver the course of the lengthy speech, the mood gradually devolved, eventually leading to outright bickering. In fact, there was only one strong bipartisan moment — and it happened to involve athletes walking into the press gallery.\n\nThat's just past the 99 minutes he spoke for last year, when he previously set the record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe speech hit many of the president's usual talking points, sprinkled in a few policy proposals, and emphasized the theatrics.\n\nJust like in years past, the speech had its share of drama, with lawmakers heckling the president and one even being escorted out.\n\nHere's what it was like, and what I saw during the speech.\n\nIf you're watching the State of the Union from home, you might be wondering where the reporters covering the speech in person are sitting.\n\nThe answer: Behind the president, in a gallery above the floor of the House chamber. It's the same floor where the dignitaries' guests sit.\n\nIn normal times, reporters can come and go freely from the gallery. Due to the high demand to watch this major speech, I had to get a press pass, which gave me access to an assigned seat.\n\nRoughly 140 reporters and photographers were up in the gallery with me — about 90 of them in seats, and another 50 standing.\n\nReporters are also strictly forbidden from taking photos in the House chamber, so I'm not able to share any firsthand look at the gallery.\n\nLast year, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was thrown out of the House chamber for loudly protesting during Trump's speech.\n\nThis year, he was thrown out again.\n\nAt the beginning of the speech, Green quietly unfurled a sign declaring that \"Black People Aren't Apes,\" an apparent reference to a video that was briefly posted on Trump's Truth Social account earlier this month that depicted President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nRepublican lawmakers were incensed, with Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma at one point trying to tear the sign out of Green's hand.\n\nUltimately, a staffer led Green out of the chamber.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into Trump's speech, we were met with a surprise — members of the US Men's Hockey team streamed into the press gallery, bringing the room's attention toward an area where all the reporters were sitting.\n\nLawmakers broke into cheers and applause. It was one of the few bipartisan moments of applause of the whole night.\n\nIn the House, the chamber is evenly divided between the Republican side and the Democratic side. But you wouldn't know it from Tuesday night's speech.\n\nThere were noticeably fewer Democrats on hand, with several seats appearing to be empty on their side of the aisle. Several Republicans, apparently taking advantage of the open space, even sat on the Democratic side.\n\nMany of the Democratic women who did attend could be seen wearing white, a color associated with the suffragette movement.\n\nAhead of the speech, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged Democrats to either boycott the speech or sit in silent protest, an apparent effort to avoid the disruptions that marked last year's speech.\n\nRep. Becca Balint of Vermont was among dozens of Democrats who opted to attend the \"People's State of the Union\" — a rally sponsored by the liberal groups MeidasTouch and MoveOn that was held on the National Mall — instead of the speech.\n\n\"I want to be surrounded by positive people who are really thinking about how to bring this country together,\" Balint told me. \"I cannot normalize this anymore. I just can't.\"\n\nOne Democrat who chose to attend, Rep. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, told me before the speech that he believes it's \"important for me to be there to see what the president has to say.\"\n\n\"People can choose to do what they want, but I feel like it's part of my job to show up,\" Vasquez said.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court voted to strike down many of Trump's tariffs on Friday, many wondered if there would be fireworkers at Tuesday night's speech.\n\nAfter all, Supreme Court justices are seated directly in front of the president.\n\nUltimately, the confrontation never came, but it was a little awkward.\n\nJust four of the nine justices showed up for Trump's speech: John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Elena Kagan. All of those justices except Kavanaugh voted to strike down the tariffs.\n\nTrump shook each of the justices' hands before taking the podium, and the justices sat stone-faced when Trump mentioned the court's \"very unfortunate\" ruling.\n\nAs Trump spoke about the tariffs, scattered laughter could be heard throughout the chamber.\n\n\"They're right in front of you!\" someone from the Democratic side could be heard yelling at one point, referring to the justices.\n\nWith the exception of Al Green, the first hour of Trump's speech was relatively free of major disruptions.\n\nA major turning point was when Trump discussed funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota began loudly heckling Trump over the killing of two American citizens by immigration agents in Minneapolis. Trump at one point fired back, saying the lawmakers should be \"ashamed\" of themselves.\n\nThe heckling continued as Trump moved on to election security and transgender issues.\n\n\"These people are crazy,\" Trump remarked at one point.\n\nThe president, along with every member of the House and Senate, is entitled to bring a guest to the speech. Generally, they sit in the gallery, which sits one floor above the chamber.\n\nSen. Rick Scott of Florida brought \"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary. Several Democrats brought Epstein survivors. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina invited David Ellison, Paramount's CEO.\n\nTrump brought Erika Kirk, who succeeded her late husband Charlie Kirk as the head of Turning Point USA, after he was killed in September.\n\nOne person who attended last year, but wasn't there this year: Elon Musk.\n\nAfter the speech, many lawmakers and Cabinet secretaries head to Statuary Hall, where journalists and TV cameras await them.\n\nIt's not unlike the \"spin room\" at a presidential debate, where each side gives its take on what happened that night.\n\nRepublican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee snagged an aisle seat and got to shake Trump's hand, though he wouldn't tell me what the two talked about.\n\n\"It was about our cat, and our barn that we named after him,\" Burchett joked.\n\nBurchett said Trump's speech was so long because he \"had a lot of successes that he needed to talk about.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Sarah McBride of Delaware, on the other hand, told reporters that Trump's speech was full of lies while defending the reaction of lawmakers like Tlaib and Omar.\n\n\"This administration has literally killed American citizens under the guise of addressing immigration,\" McBride said.",

    "description": "\"Congressional action will not be necessary. It's already time-tested and approved\"",
    "fullText": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) dutifully stood and applauded as President Donald Trump hyped his new mechanism for unilaterally levying tariffs, for which he claimed, “Congressional action will not be necessary.”\n\nTrump slammed the Supreme Court for striking down his unconstitutional global tariffs last week, but promised they will remain in place and foreign countries will continue to negotiate with him.\n\nOther nations “will continue to work along the same successful path that we had negotiated before the Supreme Court’s unfortunate involvement. So despite the disappointing ruling, these powerful country-saving — it’s saving our country, the kind of money we’re taking in — peace-protecting — many of the wars I’ve settled was because of the threat of tariffs,” Trump said, adding:\n\nI wouldn’t have been able to settle them without it. Will remain in place under fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes. And they have been tested for a long time. They’re a little more complex, but they’re actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before.\n\nCongressional action will not be necessary. It’s already time-tested and approved. And as time goes by, I believe the tariffs paid for by foreign countries will, like in the past, substantially replace the modern-day system of income tax, taking a great financial burden off the people that I love. Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment, and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America because we finally have a president who puts America first. I put America first. I love America.\n\nJohnson rose along with Vice President JD Vance and the rest of the Republicans in the chamber to applaud the line, despite the fact that Congress will have to vote to continue Trump’s latest round of tariffs.\n\nTrump used Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to levy an additional 15% global tariff on the U.S.’s trading partners following the Supreme Court’s ruling. Section 122 requires Congress to vote on keeping the levies in place after 150 days and is all but certain to be challenged in court as the Constitution solely empowers Congress to levy tariffs.\n\nWatch the clip above via MS NOW.\n\nThe post Mike Johnson Stands and Applauds After Trump Says ‘Congressional Action Won’t Be Necessary’ on New Tariffs first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Trump wasn't willing to honor the U.S. women's team, but Jack Hughes can make sure their accomplishment isn't forgotten.",
    "fullText": "Jack Hughes has an opportunity for another gold-medal-worthy moment, and this time, he won’t have to beat a world-class goaltender to make it happen.\n\nThe Devils star only needs to use his massive platform as the new face of American hockey to make sure the other U.S. Olympic champions in his sport aren’t forgotten for what they accomplished in Milan.\n\nHe needs to do what President Donald Trump couldn’t do, inexplicably, with his callous dismissal of the U.S. women’s team during a locker room phone call as the men celebrated their historic victory over Canada. Trump made a dumb joke about needing to invite the women to the White House for the State of the Union address, too, as if they deserved that honor less than the men.\n\n“I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump told the men’s team before adding that if he didn’t, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.”\n\nSeveral men gathered around the phone laughed, and while that sparked outrage, it feels unfair to hold that against them. This was a joyous atmosphere just moments after the signature victory of their careers. Let’s give them some grace for that initial reaction.\n\nWhat happens now, though, is on them. The U.S. women — surprise! — turned down Trump’s half-hearted invitation to the State of the Union address, while Hughes and 19 of his teammates were expected to be in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night for the speech.\n\n“No matter what your views are, we’re super excited to go to the White House tomorrow and be a part of that,” Hughes told The Daily Mail.\n\nThat sentiment sounds nice, but in these divided times, it falls flat. From the moment the players invited FBI director Kash Patel into the locker room to awkwardly chug a beer as if he himself had scored the winning goal, the gold-medal moment went from a unifying time to something else that we can yell at each other about on social media. That’s just the reality of the world we’re living in now.\n\nOn one point, though, there should be universal agreement: The U.S. women’s team deserves as much attention and credit for their gold-medal victory over Canada as the men do. Hughes, whose mother, Ellen, is a player development consultant for the women’s team, should make sure he never misses an opportunity to talk about them in the same breath as he does his own team’s accomplishment.\n\nThis should come naturally. Hughes was asked in the chaos of his team’s overtime victory what his first thought was after he sent the puck past Canadian goaltender Jordan Binnington. He didn’t talk about how this goal would ensure his immortality in U.S. hockey, or how the next generation of American kids might be emulating him in their driveways or ice rinks.\n\n“Honestly, first thought was, ‘We just won. How do I get my gloves and helmet off?’” Hughes said. “And surprisingly enough, one of the first people I thought of was Megan Keller, who had the gold-medal goal the other night.”\n\nKeller isn’t some stranger. The players on the two U.S. teams became friendly in the athletes’ village, with Hughes and his brother, Quinn, in a group of men’s team players who attended the women’s gold-medal game. The two teams hung out in the cafeteria after their Closing Ceremony, packing their bags and reminiscing.\n\n“If you could see what we see from the inside, and the men and women sharing, you know, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheered on the women — that’s what it’s all about,\" Ellen Hughes told the Today Show. “And the other things they cannot control. They care about humanity. They care about unity and they care about the country.”\n\nClearly, Ellen Hughes has raised her kids the right way. In 2023, Jack voiced his unequivocal support for the Devils’ decision to hold a Pride Night when other teams were canceling their celebrations. The LGBTQ community cheered when Hughes declared, “There was never a thought to not do it.”\n\nHe can own this fraught moment in a similar fashion. That doesn’t mean challenging Trump or angering either side of the political divide. It means doing the right thing and using his platform to remind this country — and, yes, the president himself — that we have the two greatest hockey teams in the world.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will deliver the first official State of the Union address of his term on Tuesday, and there are a few things investors should be listening for that could move markets.\n\nThe State of the Union isn't typically a market-moving event, but uncertainty around Trump's tariff regime following the Supreme Court's ruling and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran mean investors are looking for signals of what's next from the president.\n\n\"This is usually a non-market-moving event and shouldn't cause a ripple effect on Wall St., with the speech telegraphed with little surprise or fanfare. However, the one constant under President Trump is that we can predict the unpredictable,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief market strategist Jay Woods said ahead of Tuesday evening's address.\n\nThe remarks are expected to be highly watched, with a poll from Scripps News/Talker Research finding that two-thirds of Americans see this State of the Union address as more important than previous years.\n\nHere is what investors should be keeping on their radar during Trump's speech.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the majority of Trump's tariffs are illegal, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't justify the import duties.\n\nTrump doubled down, lifting global tariffs to 15% using alternative frameworks to justify his trade war.\n\nLegal battles around tariffs are expected to continue, leaving investors without a clear picture of what's to come. In particular, the fight over tariff rebates for companies may just be getting started.\n\nAny comments from Trump about his trade plans could reshape Wall Street's expectations and move stocks.\n\n\"In his speech, we might learn more of his intent to continue to levy tariffs despite the SCOTUS decision,\" Woods said, adding that these comments could impact markets.\n\nOil prices have been volatile amid tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nWoods says that if Trump were to indicate an escalation of war against Iran, it could move markets.\n\nThe US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East. Updates from Trump about the US presence in Iran could add to volatility in the oil market, putting pressure on a key input for inflation.\n\nIt might be less of a market-moving update than tariffs or military action against Iran, but Trump is also expected to harp on the economy and his push to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.\n\nThe US economy has avoided what many feared would be the worst-case scenario under some of his policies, but worries persist.\n\nAlmost half of Americans are most interested in what Trump says about the economy, the Scripps News/Talker Research poll showed.\n\nComments from Trump about the economy could impact investor perception on inflation and the labor market, which could change expectations for the timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

    "fullText": "Some US presidents have more of the gift of the gab than others.\n\nThe American Presidency Project has tracked the length of every president's State of the Union address since 1964, with the timer beginning when the president opens with \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker.\"\n\nIn the State of the Union, which is mandated by the Constitution, presidents typically highlight their administration's accomplishments and lay out their legislative agenda in a speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresidents usually also introduce their legislative priorities in a joint address during their first year in office, a tradition started by President Ronald Reagan. Though this speech doesn't technically qualify as a State of the Union, it is widely regarded as such and is included in the American Presidency Project's dataset.\n\nOn average, State of the Union speeches from 1964 onwards have lasted 56 minutes and 24 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project. President Richard Nixon gave the shortest-ever State of the Union speech in 1972 at 28 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton have given eight of the top 10 longest State of the Union speeches in history. In 2025, Trump broke Clinton's record when his joint address to Congress clocked in at 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds.\n\nIt's a record Trump could break again when he delivers the State of the Union on February 24 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHere's how the top 10 longest State of the Union addresses stack up.",

    "fullText": "Wall Street professionals are currently witnessing a massive reshuffling of capital across both traditional and digital asset classes.\n\nThe atmosphere in the trading pits is electric as the clock ticks toward the 9pm ET State of the Union address.\n\nWealthy traders, often called whales due to their ability to move markets with large transactions, are not waiting for the president to take the podium. They are shifting millions of dollars into defensive positions and speculative bets.\n\nThis urgent movement follows a series of shocks that have left the global financial system on edge.\n\nThe market tension traces back to a major legal blow delivered last week on Feb. 20.\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\n“We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”\n\nTrump first launched the tariff wave on April 2, 2025, a day he branded “Liberation Day.” His administration argued that persistent US trade deficits constituted a national emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress under IEEPA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling specifically invalidated tariffs imposed under IEEPA but left intact sector-based tariffs enacted under other trade laws.\n\nTrump called the decision “deeply disappointing” and insisted the Court had only limited one legal pathway. In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Washington. \n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll suggests that Americans are increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s age and state of mind.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted online between February 18 and 23, measured the attitudes of 4,638 American adults. It found that 89% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans, and 64% of independents believe that the president is becoming “erratic with age.” Taken altogether, 61% of respondents described Trump that way.  Forty-five percent, meanwhile, still believe that he “is mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” Forty-nine percent say he is not.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of respondents indicated that “elected officials in Washington, D.C.” more generally “are too old to represent most Americans.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating ticked up two points to 40% and net approval rating went up by four points to -18%. The former number had  stood pat at 38% in the previous two Reuters/Ipsos polls, which were conducted in mid-February and late January, when his net approval rating came in at -22% and -21%, respectively.\n\nThe president’s approval rating has slipped with among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics since February of last year, but most precipitously with that last group, from 36% to 29%. His economic approval rating has also taken a notable dip over that timeframe, from 41% to 36%.\n\nThe post Most Americans — Including 30% of Republicans — Believe Trump Is Becoming ‘Erratic With Age’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Mortgage rates dipped below a key threshold this week. That could be a boon for Donald Trump's affordability push, but it's not necessarily for the reason the president wants.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage in the US dropped to 5.99% on Monday, per the Mortgage News Daily Rate Index. That's the lowest borrowing costs have been for prospective home buyers since 2022. The decline has been driven by the latest decrease in Treasury yields.\n\nHowever, rather than pricing in lower rates in the medium-term, which is what Trump wants to see, government bond yields have dropped because investors are freaked out again about the trade war.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury declined in the days since the Supreme Court struck down most of Trump's tariffs, dropping five basis points on Monday alone.\n\nThe president's response to the ruling that he would initiate a new global tariff of 15% has reignited investors' fears about the trade war.\n\nThough most of Trump's tariffs have been struck down, the prospect of a 15% universal tariff, combined with the sell-off in tech driven by AI in recent weeks, has caused investors to flee to safety.\n\nJPMorgan said on Monday that the risk-off move has caused yields to spike. Investors are grasping for safe havens amid a new cocktail of market worries, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, told Business Insider, pointing to the concurrent rise in hedges like gold. The metal is up about 4% in the last five days.\n\nThe 10-year yield has plummeted to its lowest levels so far this year, and now looks \"very close\" to its low in April 2025, around the time Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sparked investor panic and a historical sell-off, according to Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\n\"We are, in other words, in pretty unusual territory,\" Colas wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

And, in a new development, AI enthusiasts in America can now expect a made-in-the-USA version of Apple's small computer.\n\nThe tech giant announced Tuesday that it would be significantly expanding its factory operations to bring some production of the Mac Mini to the US for the first time. Beginning later this year, Mac Mini units will be produced at a new factory at Apple's existing Houston manufacturing site to help fulfill US orders.\n\nThe company said it will also expand advanced its AI server manufacturing at the Houston factory, an effort that it expects to create thousands of job. It's in line with Apple's previous commitment to invest $600 billion into its US facilities and create 20,000 jobs over the next four years.\n\n\"Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we're proud to significantly expand our footprint in Houston with the production of Mac Mini starting later this year,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThere's been some hype around the Mac Mini in 2026, as people seek to operate OpenClaw, an open-source autonomous AI agent. The buzzy AI project has renewed interest in the Mac Mini. It's currently produced in Asia, with many models being listed as Vietnam-made. Overseas production of the computer will continue.\n\nApple's 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center is under construction in Houston, and it will be a site where students, supplier employees, and American businesses can receive hands-on training in the company's manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn its announcement, Apple shouted out several milestones its hit since its $600 billion pledge, including sourcing more that 20 billion US-made chips across 12 states, opening its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, and being on track to purchase more than 100 million advanced chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company at its Arizona facility.\n\nThe Mac Mini announcement is the latest example of Apple leaning into made-in-the-USA messaging and efforts, as Cook navigates a political balancing act in his relationship with President Donald Trump. As a consumer electronics company that sources much of production overseas, Trump's trade tariffs have cost Apple billions in costs in recent quarters. The tech giant has made tweaks to its supply chain, shifting much of the production of US-bound iPhones to India, for example, as part of its efforts to mitigate the tariff impact.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S.",
    "fullText": "Feb 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down his sweeping tariffs, is expected to come face-to-face with at least some of the justices when he delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nThe annual address, which has created uncomfortable moments for Supreme Court justices in the past, ‌could highlight the tensions between Trump and the three conservative justices who joined its three liberal members in the 6-3 ruling on Friday: Chief Justice John Roberts, Neil Gorsuch and Amy ‌Coney Barrett.\n\nThe Republican president appointed Gorsuch in 2017 and Barrett in 2020 during his first term in office. Roberts has served as chief justice for more than two decades since being appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush in 2005.\n\nAfter the ruling was ​issued on Friday, Trump denounced the court and the six justices who ruled against him. The court in the decision found that Trump had exceeded his powers by bypassing Congress and imposing the tariffs under a U.S. law meant for use in national emergencies.\n\nTrump said he was \"ashamed\" of the three conservative justices who ruled against him, calling them \"fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical-left Democrats.\" RINO, meaning \"Republican in name only,\" is a term sometimes used by conservative Republicans to insult fellow Republicans viewed as disloyal to the party.\n\nGorsuch and Barrett, Trump said, were \"an embarrassment to their families\" for ruling against him on tariffs. Trump also alleged, without providing evidence, ‌that the court has been \"swayed by foreign interests.\"\n\nTrump, though, lauded the three ⁠justices who ruled in his favor, with high praise in particular for his 2018 appointee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSupreme Court justices often attend the State of the Union address, and some of the current nine are expected to be present inside the U.S. House of Representatives chamber for Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress. The ⁠court has not yet said which justices will attend on Tuesday.\n\nCustomarily, justices who attend wear their judicial robes and typically sit expressionless.\n\nThe attendance of the justices \"sends a message of stability\" and \"conveys that these aren't enemy institutions,\" Brown University political science professor Corey Brettschneider said.\n\nIn an address to Congress last year, Trump clasped Roberts by the hand, patted him on the shoulder, and told him: \"Thank you again. I won't forget.\"\n\nThe remark came in the aftermath of a 2024 Supreme Court ​decision ​authored by Roberts granting Trump, who had faced criminal charges while out of office, broad immunity from prosecution for ​official acts as president. Trump later said he was thanking Roberts for swearing him ‌at his inauguration.\n\nFour justices attended Trump's last formal State of the Union in 2020.\n\nRoberts has attended every State of the Union address since joining the Supreme Court, even though he has publicly questioned why he bothers.\n\n\"The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering, while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling,\" Roberts said during a 2010 speech at the University of Alabama, according to media reports.\n\n\"To the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally,\" Roberts added, \"I'm not sure why we're there.\"\n\nRoberts made those remarks after Democratic President Barack Obama during his State of the Union address criticized a Supreme Court ruling striking down certain campaign finance limits, saying it would \"open the floodgates\" ‌to unlimited corporate and potentially foreign money in U.S. elections.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito, present for the speech, reacted by ​shaking his head and appearing to mouth \"not true,\" a departure from the traditionally impassive demeanor of the justices.\n\nAlito has shunned the ​State of the Union ever since, calling it a \"very awkward\" tradition.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with the ​American Spectator, a conservative news outlet, Alito indicated that justices may be placed in a difficult position attending State of the Union addresses.\n\n\"Every once in a while the ‌president will say something that is nonpartisan,\" Alito said. \"We look foolish sitting there, ​so we stand up and start to applaud. And ​then we'll get faked out. The president will get say, 'This is a great country' - and everyone will stand up and start to applaud - 'because we're gonna do this, we're gonna enact this legislation.' It's a very odd experience.\"\n\nThe late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia also had a policy of skipping the speech, which he once called a \"childish spectacle.\"\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden during his 2024 State of the ​Union address looked directly at the justices who were present and admonished ‌them over the court's 2022 ruling that rolled back abortion rights.\n\n\"With all due respect, justices, women are not without ... electoral or political power,\" Biden said.\n\nThe last time all nine members ​of the court missed a State of the Union address was in 2000, near the end of Democratic President Bill Clinton's second term. The court, in a public statement ​at the time, attributed the absences to \"travel changes and minor illnesses.\"",

    "description": "Nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and another one in four borrowers is behind on payments, a new report said.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers are falling behind on payments at record levels.\n\nA new report by left-leaning groups, the Century Foundation and Protect Borrowers, found that nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers — or one out of every five — are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made a payment for more than 270 days.\n\nAdditionally, the report said that one in four borrowers with a payment due is in delinquency, meaning they're behind on payments, and those borrowers have seen their credit scores decrease by 57 points on average over the first three quarters of 2025. A drop in credit can cause borrowers to lose access to various forms of credit or loans, making it difficult to afford basic necessities, the report said.\n\nThis data follows President Donald Trump's restart of collections for defaulted borrowers in May 2025 after a five-year pause. While the Department of Education announced in January that it was pausing wage garnishments and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers, it's unclear when the pause will lift, and more borrowers could be at risk of facing those consequences.\n\nThe report said that the pause is \"welcome\" but \"puts a band-aid on a serious wound.\"\n\n\"Considering the nation's worsening affordability crisis and unprecedented number of borrowers entering default, resuming garnishments would be cruel and economically reckless,\" the report said.\n\nEllen Keast, the Department of Education's press secretary for higher education, attributed the rise in delinquency and defaults to various relief measures that the Biden administration put in place, including the \"on-ramp\" to repayment, during which the department did not report any missed payments to credit agencies.\n\n\"The idea of a sudden increase in delinquencies in student loans is a misnomer — the Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago,\" Keast said. She added that the department \"will continue to support regular, on-time repayment.\"\n\nThe Department of Education released guidance on February 18, urging institutions to reduce student default rates. The guidance included updated nonpayment rates, which are the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment between January 2020 and May 2024 with federal student loans more than 90 days delinquent. Over 1800 institutions have nonpayment rates at or above 25%, the guidance said.\n\n\"Student borrowers have an obligation to repay their loans, but institutions also share a responsibility to ensure their students are prepared to enter repayment and understand the consequences of nonpayment,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. \"Institutions cannot benefit from taxpayer dollars while ignoring the fact that a significant share of their students are not well-prepared to repay their loans.\"\n\nThe department's looming repayment changes could make things more difficult for some borrowers. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with less generous options, meaning borrowers will face longer timelines to loan forgiveness and likely higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department also announced a settlement to eliminate Biden's SAVE plan, which would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to relief. The report said that SAVE borrowers are \"more financially fragile than the average borrower,\" citing data from the Biden administration showing that more than half of them qualified for $0 monthly payments, putting them at greater risk of delinquency and default.\n\nStudent loan borrowers have a few options to get out of default. One option is loan rehabilitation, in which a borrower must contact their servicer and enter an agreement to make nine payments over 10 consecutive months. While wage and benefits garnishment will continue during this time, the default status will be removed from the borrower's credit report once rehabilitation is complete.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, in which a borrower can apply to consolidate a defaulted student loan into a federal consolidation loan. After consolidation, the borrower would become eligible for federal benefits, but the default status would remain on the borrower's credit history.",

    "fullText": "President Trump’s top mouthpiece has flipped out over criticism leveled at “Keystone” Kash Patel after the FBI director was busted celebrating with a U.S. Olympic team on the taxpayers’ dime.\n\nPatel, who, on becoming FBI director, said resources would go solely toward fighting crime, was pictured celebrating in Italy with Team USA after its overtime Olympic victory over Team Canada in the men’s hockey final.\n\nThe 45-year-old hockey buff mingled with the players while guzzling beers and beating his chest as if he were part of the team. He even commandeered a gold medal at one point, looping it around his neck. The fallout was spectacular, with many wondering why the embattled crime chief was in party mode while his bureau struggles to find the missing mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nThere were also concerns about the nature of the foreign jaunt, given that Patel’s office had insisted it was “strictly” business, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carol Leonnig.\n\nShe provoked the ire of White House communications director Steven Cheung by posting about the saga on X. “Yes - Multiple sources have sent me and @KDilanianMSNOW this video *appearing to show* @FBIDirectorKash Patel guzzling from a beer and partying in locker room w US men’s hockey team. His office insisted this was strictly a business trip. We at @MSNOWNews will share what we learn,\" she wrote on Sunday evening.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, a bristling Cheung replied. “Carol, you’re either mentally deficient or a liar,” he began.\n\n“This ‘exclusive’ video your ‘sources’ sent you is actually from a publicly available Instagram story. Second, Kash was also in Italy meeting with regional partners and security teams. Third, don’t be mad because America won,” he told the American journalist.\n\nThe video comes at a time when the FBI is struggling to locate 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie, after her abduction earlier this month. Apparently work-shy Patel, nicknamed Keystone Kash for his ham-fisted efforts as head of the bureau, also has a growing crisis in Mexico to consider.\n\nA military operation that resulted in the death of the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the world’s most-wanted drug traffickers, has sparked chaos on the streets of many places popular with tourists, including Americans.\n\nAs a result, Americans in affected areas have been ordered to shelter in place due to safety concerns. “Due to ongoing, widespread security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity in many areas of Mexico, U.S. citizens should shelter in place until further notice,” the State Department announced on Sunday.\n\nPatel also posted on X while watching the Team USA game from a box inside Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe post came after an armed man was shot and killed when he entered the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s residence in Florida.",

    "description": "Critics worry about what forgiveness and repayment options borrowers may have if federal student loans are sold to private lenders.",
    "fullText": "The Education Department said it has not made a final decision on selling off federal student loans.\n\nIt's the first time the administration has publicly acknowledged that a sale to private companies is under consideration.\n\nIt comes as private lenders prepare for an influx of borrowers amid looming repayment changes.\n\nThe future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhen asked for additional detail on a potential sale, Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education, told Business Insider that \"we continue to evaluate and implement strategies to strengthen the fiscal integrity of the nearly $1.7 trillion portfolio and safeguard the interests of both students and taxpayers.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.",

    "description": "Their statement says Christians have a moral obligation to condemn the demonization of immigrants and attacks on civil rights and diversity.",
    "fullText": "Hundreds of Christian leaders and scholars nationwide are denouncing President Donald Trump’s administration and urging more active resistance among the faithful to “the injustices and anti-democratic danger sweeping across the nation.”\n\n“We are facing a cruel and oppressive government,” their collective statement begins. “In moments like this, silence is not neutrality — it is an active choice to permit harm.”\n\nTitled “A Call to Christians in a Crisis of Faith and Democracy,” the letter says the nation is facing a profound moral, spiritual, and democratic emergency. Its release coincides with the start of the Christian season of Lent, a period of repentance, self-reflection and resistance to temptation.\n\n“We thought it was important to tie into a season where many Christians go deeper into their faith,” said Adam Russell Taylor, president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice organization. “Part of what we’re critiquing is the way in which many White evangelical Christians succumb to an unconditional support of the administration, despite the fact that its actions are completely antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.”\n\nLeaders of all faiths have increasingly spoken out and participated in protests against the policies of the Trump administration, particularly aimed at what many see as overly aggressive efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Pastors have been arrested and struck with pepper balls during demonstrations.\n\nThe statement says Christians have a moral obligation to speak out against “citizens and immigrants being demonized, disappeared, and even killed; the erosion of hard-won rights and freedoms; and a calculated effort to reverse America’s growing racial and ethnic diversity – all of which are pushing us toward authoritarian and imperial rule.”\n\n“This moment is a defining test of Christian discipleship and civic responsibility,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder and director of the Georgetown Center for Faith and Justice in Washington, D.C.. “Democratic freedoms are being taken away and the gospel is being distorted. The vulnerable people Jesus told us to stand with and defend are being targeted and assaulted.”\n\nWallis and Taylor organized the collective effort along with Barbara Williams-Skinner, president of Baltimore’s Skinner Institute, a faith leadership development organization.\n\nAbout 400 people initially signed the statement, representing a range of Christian denominations, leaders of Black, Asian and Latino churches and associations and Christian universities and institutions. Hundreds more have added their names since the letter’s Feb. 18 release, organizers say.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President of the United States, which includes the White House office, did not respond to a request for comment about the statement.\n\nThe Christian leaders and scholars say aside from the risks to democracy, they are troubled by “a Christian faith corrupted by the heretical ideology of white Christian nationalism.”\n\n“People look at it as just a democratic crisis, but it’s not,” said the Rev. Cynthia Hale, pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Georgia, who was among those who signed the letter. “It’s a crisis of faith.”\n\nChristian nationalism, the idea that Christian people and biblical law should govern American life, has seeped into the highest levels of American government with conservative evangelicals becoming a major political force with strong support of Trump. Evangelical pastor Doug Wilson, who has said women should neither vote nor hold religious or political leadership positions, was recently invited by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to conduct a service at the Pentagon.\n\n“Their religious leaders have been so unconditionally supportive that it’s almost branded this administration as being religious in the minds of many Americans, which is a distortion,” said Bishop Raymond Rivera of the Council of Holistic Christian Churches and Ministries, who also signed the letter. “They’ve confused proximity to political power with proximity to the power of God. They’re not the same.”\n\nTaylor called such conflation “a form of idolatry” and said the Trump administration in turn has misused Christian language to support its activities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruitment ads that quote scripture in their appeals – one ad, for instance, includes a verse saying “Blessed are the peacemakers.”\n\n“That feels particularly offensive and egregious in light of the tactics we’ve seen them employ in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere,\" he said. \"It’s corrupting the Christian faith to advance its own political agenda.”\n\nKristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University, a Christian institution in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said she initially wondered before signing whether the moment required something more than signing yet another statement.\n\n“I realized this statement isn’t primarily for people who have been on the front lines of these issues but for pastors and ordinary Christians who may be just waking up to what’s happening and what’s at stake,” Du Mez said. “I think it’s important to offer a statement that clarifies the political and theological stakes and that people can put their name behind…. This is a way for ordinary Christians to step up.”\n\nThe letter concludes by tying a set of core theological convictions to actions the signers pledge to take to practice their faith and protect democracy, including defending voting rights, pursuing peace and standing with unjustly targeted immigrants.\n\nDottie Escobedo-Frank, bishop of the United Methodist Church’s California-Pacific Conference in Pasadena, said she signed the letter to encourage her Southern California community and all Christians to live out their callings to serve the downtrodden, demonstrate compassion and challenge political leaders to act on their behalf.\n\nHowever, with church ministries offering food distribution, childcare or elderly assistance having faced disruption from ICE agents or anti-immigrant demonstrators, “we’re seeing people in our communities who are afraid to live out their faith because of the actions of our government,” she said.\n\nTaylor understands many may be justifiably fearful of living out their creed but said it’s critical for people to engage at a time when “the pages of the authoritarian playbook are very much in effect,” he said.\n\nHe said one way to overcome such fears, aside from leaning into the resilience of faith itself, is to connect with other Christians. The letter effort includes a website where supporters can find ways to get involved.\n\n“One of the most consistent refrains in scripture is ‘do not be afraid,’” Taylor said. “Authoritarian governments thrive on people feeling isolated and overwhelmed, so we’re trying to create a network of solidarity and courage. We have the power to prevent things from getting worse.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Christian leaders say silence no longer option amid 'crisis of faith'",

    "description": "It came just days after Cooper announced he was leaving CBS show.",
    "fullText": "Anderson Cooper debunked President Donald Trump‘s claims of a “genocide” of white South African farmers on Sunday’s (February 22) edition of 60 Minutes.\n\nThe report, which The Daily Beast says was previously delayed by new CBS News boss Bari Weiss and subjected to an “abnormal” editing process, aired on Sunday’s show and saw Cooper traveling to South Africa to investigate Trump’s claims.\n\nIn the segment, Cooper played a clip of the president speaking to reporters in May 2025, in which he said, “It’s a genocide that’s taking place that you people don’t want to write about. It’s a terrible thing that’s taking place and farmers are being killed. They happen to be white.”\n\nTrump repeated these claims a week later when South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House. The president showed Ramaphosa video “proof” of what he said were “Burial sites. Over 1,000… of white farmers.” The video featured a row lined with several white crosses.\n\nCooper spoke with the man who erected those crosses, Darrel Brown, who said, “It definitely wasn’t a burial site. I mean those crosses were there for less than 48 hours. It was purely an avenue of crosses we planted there in honor of commercial farmers in South Africa that had lost their lives.”\n\nBrown, who keeps the crosses in a shed, said he put the crosses back up in 2024 for the funeral of his best friend, Tollie Nel, who was murdered on his farm.\n\nCooper also spoke with Tollie’s widow, Rene Nel, and asked her whether she would consider what is happening on South African farms to be a “genocide.”\n\n“Not what I know as a genocide,” she said. “Not what I’ve heard of what a genocide is. I see our attack as an opportunistic attack. They knew there was money. They knew there were firearms.”\n\nJohann Kotzé, the head of South Africa’s largest agricultural organization, also denied Trump’s claims. “It’s actually not about white genocide,” he stated. “It’s about criminality in South Africa. It’s crime. The fact that it happened on a farm doesn’t make me special as a farmer. It’s horrendous. Any murder is horrendous.”\n\nThe report comes just days after Cooper announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current broadcast season. He will continue to host Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.\n\n60 Minutes, Sundays, 7/6 c, CBS\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "The CBO estimates that benefit reductions would start at 8% in 2040 and steadily climb to a 10% cut by 2056.",
    "fullText": "Recent policy changes and economic shifts have slashed 12 years off the projected life span of the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A, according to a newly updated report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now slated to be entirely exhausted by 2040, even though the balance generally increases through 2031, as spending will begin to outstrip income in the following year.\n\nThis rapid deterioration of Medicare’s financial solvency represents a stark drop from the CBO’s previous estimate, which was published just last year, in March 2025. The dramatically shortened timeline means future retirees could face significant cuts to vital health care services far sooner than previously anticipated. As required by the Deficit Control Act, CBO Director Phillip Swagel noted the projections reflect the assumption benefits would be paid as scheduled even after the HI trust fund was exhausted.\n\nThe primary culprit for this accelerated depletion is a sharp reduction in the fund’s projected income, heavily driven by legislation passed over the last year. Specifically, the 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21, more commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) significantly reduced the revenues the trust fund normally receives from taxing Social Security benefits. This legislation lowered tax rates and established a temporary deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older. Consequently, this major policy shift enacted during the Trump administration has directly contributed to starving the Medicare safety net of critical future funding.\n\nThe HI trust fund is the financial backbone for Medicare Part A, which covers essential services including inpatient hospital care, stays in skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice care. Over the next 30 years, the fund is expected to rely on the Medicare payroll tax for about three-quarters of its annual income, with another roughly one-eighth derived from income taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nHowever, the recent tax cuts are not the only factor draining the fund. The CBO also cited decreased projections for payroll tax revenues, warning it had to adjust their models to account for lower expected worker earnings. Furthermore, because the trust fund will have smaller balances going forward, it will generate less interest income, creating a compounding negative effect on its overall finances.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Medicare spending is rising faster than anticipated. The CBO noted per-enrollee spending in Medicare Part A’s fee-for-service program in 2025, along with 2026 bids by Medicare Advantage plan providers, both came in higher than expected.",

    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court blocked a significant chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday. But instead of closing the chapter, it's opened an entirely new book that no one seems to understand.\n\nReturn of the tariffs. Despite the setback, the president isn't backing down. This weekend, he announced plans to impose a 15% \"worldwide\" tariff. That's thanks to Section 122, which allows him to briefly implement tariffs broadly. However, they can only remain in place for up to 150 days. Ultimately, he'll likely need to work with Congress for something more permanent.\n\nThe refund issue. One of the biggest questions is what happens to the $133 billion in taxes collected from the struck-down tariffs. More than a thousand companies preemptively filed lawsuits to claw back that money.\n\nThe process isn't as simple as the US government cutting a check. It's bound to get messy and involve lots of lawyers. Companies will also need to weigh the benefits of fighting for a refund against the risks of angering the current administration.\n\nSome Democrats are calling on the administration to issue $1,700 refunds directly to Americans. Shoppers shouldn't expect the ruling to mean prices are coming down soon, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nMarket reaction. It's a double-edged sword for investors. The ruling is likely to set a legal precedent that'll make it harder for the administration to impose larger tariffs than before. That's good for most businesses. Companies hit with tariffs could also get refunds, which would serve as a nice cash infusion.\n\nOn the other hand, lowering tariffs and the revenue they generate puts the spotlight firmly on the federal government's growing pile of debt. That could push bond yields higher and weigh on stocks.\n\nJefferies mapped out some consumer stocks that could benefit.\n\nThe broader economic impact. Since tariffs will remain in some form, it's tough to make a definitive statement. However, the most recent data from the past year shows a clear trend: The economy is growing, but not everyone is benefiting.\n\nIt's worth considering that a lot of the dire economic predictions people had about Trump's policies haven't materialized. A think tank offered reasons that's the case.\n\nSo who comes out on top? Even with so much still up in the air, we identified some potential winners and losers from the latest shake-up. (Hint: Lawyers are going to be just fine.) Meanwhile, many COOs are likely pulling out their hair from the tariff whiplash affecting their supply chains.\n\nWe'll get more clarity on Tuesday night during Trump's first State of the Union of his second term. Just don't expect a warm welcome for some of the Supreme Court justices.",

    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "description": "Critics worry about what forgiveness and repayment options borrowers may have if federal student loans are sold to private lenders.",
    "fullText": "The future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.\n\nThose lenders wrote to Warren and some of her Democratic colleagues that they're equipped to handle the influx, but the lawmakers said they're concerned that \"lenders have far less of an incentive to provide borrowers with loans on terms that are commensurate to those of federal loans.\"\n\nKent maintained in his letter that the department is committed to improving federal student aid programs and helping borrowers pay back their loans.\n\n\"The Department remains focused on helping borrowers return to repayment and escape the albatross of delinquency and default,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court faced criticism from President Donald Trump after striking his tariff agenda this week, as the president looks towards an upcoming ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court for striking most of his tariff agenda this week, going on to warn that a similar ruling against his birthright citizenship order would be a benefit to China.\n\nTrump made the statement in a post to his Truth Social account on Monday, clarifying that he was not frustrated with the \"Great Three,\" or the justices who sided with his administration in the tariff ruling. The Supreme Court is set to consider Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship in the coming months.\n\n\"The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Our incompetent supreme court did a great job for the wrong people, and for that they should be ashamed of themselves (but not the Great Three!). The next thing you know they will rule in favor of China and others, who are making an absolute fortune on Birthright Citizenship, by saying the 14th Amendment was NOT written to take care of the 'babies of slaves,' which it was as proven by the EXACT TIMING of its construction, filing, and ratification, which perfectly coincided with the END OF THE CIVIL WAR,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump Reveals His 'New Hero' Supreme Court Justice After Tariffs Ruling\n\n\"How much better can you do than that? But this supreme court will find a way to come to the wrong conclusion, one that again will make China, and various other Nations, happy and rich. Let our supreme court keep making decisions that are so bad and deleterious to the future of our Nation - I have a job to do,\" he added.\n\nTrump signed his birthright citizenship order on his first day back in office last year. The order seeks to end birthright citizenship for nearly all persons born in the U.S. to undocumented parents, or parents with lawful temporary status in the country — a seismic shift that critics note would break with some 150 years of legal precedent.\n\nTrump's order would reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\" — a provision that administration officials argue has been misinterpreted.\n\nTrump's Tariff Revenues Hit Record Highs As Supreme Court Deals Major Blow\n\nThe language put forth by the Trump administration seeks to clarify that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling on the issue could have sweeping national implications for an issue Trump officials argue is a crucial component of his hard-line immigration agenda, which has become a defining feature of his second White House term.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the effort is an unconstitutional and \"unprecedented\" effort that would threaten some 150,000 children in the U.S. born annually to parents of non-citizens, and an estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 who are living with an illegal immigrant parent, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nFox News' Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday permanently barred the release of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents that led to charges once seen as the most perilous of the four criminal cases the Republican faced.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, granted a request from the president to keep under wraps the report on an investigation alleging Trump stored sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House following his first term and obstructed government efforts to get them back.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on the classified documents investigation and a separate probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Joe Biden. Both investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith’s team after Trump’s November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had already determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department, according to court papers. The Trump administration has characterized Smith's investigation as politically motivated and said in recent court papers that the report belongs in the “dustbin of history.\"\n\nCannon's order, however, blocking the release also applies to Bondi's successors at the Justice Department. Cannon, who in 2024 dismissed the case after concluding that Smith was unlawfully appointed after multiple other favorable rulings for Trump, said the release of the report would present a “manifest injustice” to the president and his two co-defendants.\n\n“Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges,” she wrote. “As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.”\n\nA First Amendment group and watchdog organization that have been pressing for the report's release could presumably continue to fight in higher courts for it become public.\n\n“Judge Cannon’s decision to permanently block the release of this extraordinarily significant report is impossible to square with the First Amendment and the common law,” said Scott Wilkens, senior counsel at The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, one of the groups pushing for the public release of the report. “There is no legitimate basis for its continued suppression.”\n\nCannon wrote that though it is true that special counsels have historically released reports at the conclusion of their work, they have done so either after electing not to bring charges in a particular case or “after adjudications of guilt by plea or trial.\" Though Cannon suggested that an adjudication of guilt typically precedes the release of a special counsel report, there have been instances in which defendants charged by a special counsel have been acquitted at trial and the allegations against them have nonetheless been subsequently rehashed in a publicly released report.\n\nThe classified documents case was once considered the most serious of the four criminal cases against him. It accused Trump of repeatedly enlisting aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showing off a Pentagon “plan of attack” and classified map.\n\nThe first volume of Smith’s report on Trump’s 2020 election interference case was released last year shortly before Trump returned to the White House. Smith has defended his decision to bring those charges, saying he believes they would have resulted in a conviction had voters not elected Trump in 2024.\n\nCannon last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with the classified documents case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified last month before the House Judiciary Committee.",

    "fullText": "The dollar declined against foreign currencies. Stocks in Asia and Europe broadly sold off, and S&P 500 futures were down 0.22% before the open in New York as investors began to realize that the fallout from the U.S. Supreme Court’s tariff decision, and President Donald Trump’s reaction to it, is going to be more complex than traders initially thought. \n\nGoldman Sachs also reported that its in-house “Risk Appetite Indicator” had sunk back from its recent peak.\n\nIn that context, investors fled—again—to the safe haven of gold, which rose 1.81% this morning and looked to be making an attempt at a new record high.\n\nHow are global markets reacting to Trump's tariff proposals?\n\nWhy are countries postponing U.S. trade deal negotiations?\n\nWhat makes gold attractive during trade policy uncertainty?\n\nWhat trade law sections could Trump use for tariffs?\n\nAt first glance, ending the tariffs looked broadly good for stocks because it makes international trade easier and cheaper for companies. Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500 closed up 0.69% on Friday.\n\nBut after Trump said he would propose new tariffs of 10%, and then changed his mind and made it 15%, analysts began to realize that some of the things Trump might do next could be more extreme than his “Liberation Day” tariffs and will certainly be more complex.\n\nAs UBS’s Paul Donovan put it, “Welcome back uncertainty.”\n\nBNP analyst William Bratton published a research note summarizing Trump’s options. “Some of these could be highly punitive,” he said:\n\nSection 122 of the 1974 Trade Act is valid only for the next 150 days and must then be extended by Congress. It is not applicable to agricultural products, metals, minerals, chemicals, oil, gas, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, some electronics, and various automobiles.\n\nSection 301 tariffs “have no upper limit, have proved to be highly sticky once implemented (as with those imposed on China in 2018), and could, in theory, be applied to any country that does not agree to a trade agreement with the U.S. that embeds higher tariffs,” Bratton wrote.\n\nSection 232 tariffs also “have no upper limit and can be expanded in scope once implemented. Trump has already used this law to expand and raise the tariffs on multiple products—most notably on cars and car parts—and various Section 232 investigations are currently ongoing including into semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.”\n\nBratton argued that Asian companies will react by increasingly detaching themselves from U.S. trade. “We expect U.S. trade policy…to become increasingly complex and more targeted resulting in a patchwork of tariff measures and trade agreements…the global economy will continue to fragment with U.S. trade flows steadily becoming less important as Asian trade becomes increasingly more regional in nature,” he told clients.",

So this is my plea for help. President, Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we gotta go to Belgrade, Serbia for the UFC this summer.”\n\nWe have our doubts the UFC will make the trip to Serbia any time soon, but Medic now can because UFC CEO Dana White got U.S. president Donald Trump on the phone to take care of his issues.\n\n“I’m back in his office and Dana’s got president Donald Trump on speaker phone,” Medic said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m just standing there and I cannot believe what’s happening. I’m talking to the president, and he said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. You can travel. Just give Dana documentation, the information that you need.'”\n\n“I’m just blown away. I mean, I love Mr. President, and his wife is from Slovenia, First Lady Melania … It was just amazing for me to be able to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him. And obviously, his wife, who is from where I’m from – or I’m considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country. It’s like a five-hour drive. That’s nothing for America. Like, you can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.”\n\n“So yeah, I’m still processing all of it.”\n\nThat’s great news for Medic, who has been unable to travel back to his home country for three years now. Between the knockout of the year candidate, his $100,000 bonus, and getting his visa fixed, it’s been a pretty good weekend for the Serbian fighter.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe president and his party appear vulnerable, with polls showing much of America distrusts how Trump has managed the government in his first year back in office. In addition, the Supreme Court last week struck down one of the chief levers of his economic and foreign policy by ruling he lacked the power to impose many of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThough Trump is expected to focus on domestic issues, his intensifying threats about launching military strikes on Iran over its nuclear program cast a shadow over the address.\n\nHere are a few things to watch as Trump tries to make his case:\n\nTrump swept back into the White House on promises to bring down prices and restore order to immigration in America. But on both issues, public sentiment has turned against him.\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership and just 38% support him on immigration, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Those low numbers show the country is still fretting about the costs of groceries, housing and utilities, a problem compounded by Trump's whipsawing use of tariffs. They also show how the public was disturbed by videos of violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.\n\nSince his party passed a massive tax cut bill last year, Trump has yet to unveil major new policy ideas on the economy. In recent speeches, he has largely offered the public reruns about his tax cuts, plans to reduce mortgage rates and a new government website for buying prescription drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling against many of Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday and the president vowing to use other means to forge ahead with import taxes will only prolong the economic turmoil over trade and prices.\n\n“I think it makes it even more important that the speech really focus on the economy,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.\n\nConant said between the tariff ruling and a Commerce Department report on Friday that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, \"the president needs to bolster his economic message.”\n\nThe administration is trying to make the case that despite Trump's rewiring of global trade and tax cuts, the economy is still struggling because of choices made in 2021 and 2022 by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. But Trump is also seeking to take credit for positive signs in the current economy, such as recent stock market gains.\n\n“Watch the State of the Union. We’re going to be talking about the economy. We inherited a mess,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Trump made the same kind of argument in his address to a joint session of Congress last year, invoking the Biden name 13 times.\n\nDespite Trump's America First credo, his aggressive approach abroad over the past year has sparked concerns among some of his supporters about whether he should spend more time focusing on voters at home.\n\nTrump, who's made it clear he covets a Nobel Peace Prize, is likely to use the speech to remind Americans of his attempts to try to broker peace accords in global conflicts.\n\nBut in many respects, the president hasn't been extending olive branches. Within the past year, his administration has launched strikes in Yemen, Nigeria and Iran, along with an ongoing campaign of lethal military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels near South America. Trump also shocked the world in January with a surprise raid to capture Venezuela's then-leader, Nicolás Maduro, and floated the idea of using force to seize Greenland.\n\nIn recent weeks, as he pressures Iran, Trump has bolstered the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East. But he has yet to make a clear case to voters about what his actions overseas mean for their lives.\n\nHe might even minimize foreign policy in his State of the Union despite his belief that it's been a major success.\n\n“For as much as foreign policy has dominated his last year in office, this speech will mostly focus on the economy,” Conant predicted.\n\nVice President JD Vance offered a similar prediction, saying in an interview Saturday on Fox News Channel that in the speech, “you’re going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back into our country, of reshoring manufacturing, of all these great factories that are being built.”\n\nHe said Trump would also speak about lowering energy costs.\n\nThe State of the Union used to be about recapping accomplishments and seeking to unite the country, but it increasingly reflects divisions in society.\n\n“What you’re going to expect is some version of a campaign speech in which the Democrats are the villains, the Republicans he likes are the heroes, and he is the savior not only of the nation but of the globe,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump supporters might cherish the moment in 2020 when the president midspeech reunited a military family. He also bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host and author who died in 2021. But that moment turned off Democrats who saw Limbaugh as a destructive figure in political media.\n\nTrump is delivering the speech, but his audience sitting in the House chamber has a big role, too. When Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi theatrically ripped up a copy of the speech afterward, overshadowing much of what Trump said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has said in a letter to colleagues “it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,” indicating some members might choose not to attend in protest to Trump. But there's also the possibility of Democrats razzing Trump as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, did in 2025, leading him to be removed from the chamber.\n\nIf Trump in his speech lays out a fuller case for why he's using other mechanisms in federal law to continue his tariffs, Conant said it'll be interesting to see the reaction from lawmakers.\n\n“I think that any House Republicans that don't applaud his tariffs are going to be featured prominently on the telecast,” he said.\n\nWhile some presidential phrases endure, much of the rhetoric in State of the Unions is forgettable. And with Trump — who's known for veering off-script — there's a good chance a stray comment or a social media post could step on his message.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former Republican speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, noted in an email that people hear the president talk all of the time, so the State of the Union has lost much of its luster.\n\nA State of the Union “only matters in moments when the country is undergoing a great trauma — a war, an attack, a global crisis — and a president and Congress want to speak in a (mostly) united voice to the country,” he said. “That’s not what we are experiencing now.”",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nSeven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.\n\nBarrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.\n\nBarrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.\n\nKushner was asked to attend a meeting at the foreign affairs ministry scheduled on Monday evening, according to diplomatic sources. He had already been summoned in August last year over his letter to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will stand before Congress on Tuesday to deliver the annual State of the Union address to a suddenly transformed nation.\n\nOne year back in office, Trump has emerged as a president defying conventional expectations. He has executed a head-spinning agenda, upending priorities at home, shattering alliances abroad and challenging the nation's foundational system of checks and balances. Two Americans were killed by federal agents while protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids and mass deportations.\n\nAs the lawmakers sit in the House chamber listening to Trump's agenda for the year ahead, the moment is an existential one for the Congress, which has essentially become sidelined by his expansive reach, the Republican president bypassing his slim GOP majority to amass enormous power for himself.\n\n“It’s crazy,\" said Nancy Henderson Korpi, a retiree in northern Minnesota who joined an Indivisible protest group and plans to watch the speech from home. “But what is disturbing more to me is that Congress has essentially just handed over their power.”\n\nShe said, “We could make some sound decisions and changes if Congress would do their job.”\n\nThe country is at a crossroads, celebrating its 250th anniversary while experiencing some of the most significant changes to its politics, policies and general mood in many Americans' lifetimes.\n\nThe president muscled his agenda through Congress when he needed to — often pressuring lawmakers with a phone call during cliffhanger votes — but more often avoided the messy give-and-take of the legislative process to power past his own party and the often unified Democratic opposition.\n\nTrump's signature legislative accomplishment so far is the GOP’s big tax cuts bill, with its new savings accounts for babies, no taxes on tips and other specialty deductions, and steep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid. It also fueled more than $170 billion to Homeland Security for his immigration deportations.\n\nBut the GOP-led Congress has largely stood by as Trump dramatically seized power through hundreds of executive actions, many being challenged in court, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to impose his agenda.\n\n“Retrieving a lost power is no easy business in our constitutional order,” wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court's landmark rebuke of Trump's tariffs policy on Friday.\n\nGorsuch said that without the court stepping in on major questions, “Our system of separated powers and checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.”\n\nFrom slashing the federal workforce to upending the childhood vaccine schedule to attacking Venezuela and capturing that country's president, Trump's reach appeared to know no bounds.\n\nHis administration launched investigations of would-be political foes, imposed his name on historic buildings, including the storied John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and perhaps most visibly has been rounding up people and converting warehouses into detention holding centers for deportations.\n\nAt almost every step of the way, there were moments when Congress could have intervened but did not.\n\nDemocrats, in the minority, often tried to push back, including by halting routine Homeland Security funds unless there are restraints on the immigration actions.\n\nBut Republicans believe the country elected the president and gave their party control of Congress to align with his agenda, according to one senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the dynamic.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said Trump will be the “most consequential” president of the modern era.\n\nDemocrats plan to either boycott the speech or sit in stony silence.\n\n“The state of the union is falling apart,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThere have been times when Congress held its own against the White House, but they have been rare — as in the high-profile bipartisan push from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, over the objections of Johnson and GOP leadership.\n\nThe flex of congressional power has more often come from a few renegade Republicans joining with most Democrats to put a check on the president, as when the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. The Senate advanced a war powers resolution to prevent military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, but backed off after Trump intervened.\n\nThose have been mostly symbolic votes, because Congress would not have the numbers to overcome any expected Trump veto.\n\nMore often, the Congress has accommodated Trump, by rolling back already approved bipartisan funding for USAID foreign aid or public broadcasting or failing to stop the U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that killed two survivors in the Caribbean. When Trump issued a Day One pardon of some 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the Republicans in Congress did not object.\n\nAnd as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with billionaire Elon Musk started firing federal workers, GOP lawmakers signaled approval by forming their own DOGE caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The central question for us is does the public understand what's at stake” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization focused on government management and democracy. “We are in the midst of the most significant transformation of our government and our public servants in our history as a country.”\n\nHe said some 300,000 federal employees were fired or moved on, while 100,000 new hires or rehires have largely gone to Homeland Security.\n\nIn courtrooms across the country, cases are being filed against the administration at record levels, as Congress was “asleep at the wheel,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which has filed more than 150 cases against the administration, part of the largest legal effort against an executive branch in U.S. history.\n\nBut the judicial system has been under strain, and the White House has not always abided by court rulings. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump's criticism of the courts, displaying outside their offices posters of judges they want to impeach.\n\nA next big test will be over a proof-of-citizenship voting bill that Trump wants ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House has passed the SAVE America Act, which would require birth certificates or passports to register to vote in federal elections and a photo ID at the polls. Supporters say it’s needed to crack down on fraud, while critics argue it will shut millions of Americans out of voting because they don’t have citizenship documents readily available.\n\nThe Senate has a majority to pass the measure but not the necessary 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic-led filibuster.\n\nTrump has vowed executive actions if Congress fails to approve legislation.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Josh Pate announced that Donald Trump would appear on his College Football Show, he promised viewers a politics-free conversation focused strictly on the sport. However, what followed was a brisk, 10-minute exchange that often drifted far from the field.\n\nHere are the seven questions Pate posed and how the answers unfolded in the conversation.\n\nPate opened with a broad question about the sport’s structure and enforceable rules. Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "After the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations, Christie Brinkley wasted no time in raising her voice.",
    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "description": "The president now routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",
