    "fullText": "US troops and a helicopter came under fire during the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump said on Saturday, revealing new details about the overnight raid.\n\nTrump, speaking to Fox News, said American forces stormed what he described as a \"very highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress,\" and closed in on Maduro before he could reach a \"safety space\" surrounded by steel.\n\n\"I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit. But they came back, and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We lost no aircraft; everything came back — we got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard — a helicopter — but we got it back,\" the president added.\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions about Trump's comments to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for additional information.\n\nTrump earlier said the US had carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela, capturing Maduro and his wife and flying them out of the country. The operation, he said, was done in coordination with American law enforcement.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she added.\n\nVideo footage shared on social media showed helicopters flying low to the ground in Venezuela. Caracas said American forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes.\n\nSpeaking on Fox, Trump said that the US \"turned off almost all of the lights in Caracas.\" He described the raid as being \"very organized,\" with American forces working under near total darkness.\n\nHe declined to say which American forces participated in the raid. He said only that they're \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nHe said the operation was planned with \"pinpoint\" accuracy, and that the US \"built a house which was identical to the one they went into\" — a tactic similar to what the US did ahead of the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.\n\nThe US has built up a massive military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, gathering advanced warships, fighter jets, and an aircraft carrier, with the White House repeatedly threatening military action against Venezuela. He accused the country's leadership of facilitating drug-trafficking — claims Maduro rejected.\n\nUS forces have carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing over 100 people, and seized multiple Venezuela-linked oil tankers in the region.\n\nLast month, US media reported that the CIA carried out a drone strike inside Venezuela, marking the first known operation in the country since Trump's pressure campaign began. At that time, it was unclear whether he intended to escalate further.\n\n\"We were going to do this four days ago, but the weather was not perfect,\" Trump said of the operation to capture Maduro during his interview with Fox on Saturday. \"We had just the perfect weather.\"\n\nThe president later said that the US is going to be strongly involved in Venezuela's oil industry moving forward.\n\nSeveral leaders of countries in the region quickly condemned the strikes in Venezuela. Democratic US lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for the operation, while some Republicans voiced their support.",

    "fullText": "The US executed targeted, large-scale attacks in Venezuela's capital city, Caracas, overnight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday American forces struck the country's military, turned off the lights in the city, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for prosecution in New York.\n\nThe assault news has raised big questions. Here's what we know right now.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump revealed on Truth Social that the US military carried out a \"large-scale attack against Venezuela\" and that the leader had been captured and taken out of the country.\n\nThe US president didn't seek Congressional approval prior to the mission. Congress, however, was notified afterward.\n\nTrump told Fox News he watched the capture of Maduro play out in real time from a room inside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida alongside military generals.\n\n\"I was told by real military people that there's no other country on Earth that can do such a maneuver,\" he shared during a phone interview with Fox News. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show.\"\n\nTrump said the raid was \"extremely complex,\" more so than the Midnight Hammer operation against Iran's nuclear sites conducted last year. Maduro and his wife were taken to the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.\n\nTrump said US assets involved included land, air, and sea, including a \"massive number\" of aircraft and troops. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, was based on months of intelligence-gathering, including watching Maduro's patterns of life, and involved all elements of the joint force, from space and cyber assets to traditional combat forces.\n\nThe assault involved 150 aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, and helicopters and rotary aircraft — that provided \"layered effects\" to clear the way for the interdiction force to slip in with the \"element of surprise\" into downtown Caracas. Fighters and different drones covered the extraction.\n\nThere were no US personnel or equipment losses, Trump said; however, he did say that troops were hit, along with a helicopter that he said was hit \"pretty hard.\" Caine said the US responded to hostile fire with \"overwhelming\" force.\n\nTensions have been rising for months between Venezuela's Maduro regime and the Trump administration, which has ramped up its rhetoric while increasing military action nearby.\n\nThe US has blamed Venezuela for pushing deadly drugs into the country, as well as using its oil industry, which the Trump administration says the US built and intends to take back, to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nThe administration has labeled cartels and the Maduro regime terrorist organizations. Trump has also called Maduro an illegitimate leader.\n\nThe US has been launching attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats since September 2025, with over 100 people killed and others missing or captured.\n\nA massive US force presence, including warships and combat aircraft, has been in the Caribbean to combat narcotics trafficking and pressure Venezuela for months.\n\nMore recently, US forces began executing a blockade of oil tankers out of Venezuela in an effort to enforce American oil sanctions, hurting a key Venezuelan export and straining its economy.\n\nMaduro's government said that the purpose of the US attack on Venezuela was to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the nation's political independence.\"\n\nThe US has removed the leaders of sovereign states in the past. For instance, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, it captured Saddam Hussein after the Bush administration asserted the Iraqi president had weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was later convicted for crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court and executed in December 2006.\n\nA lack of evidence that Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction led to criticisms against the Bush administration's motives.\n\nMuch earlier, Panamanian military dictator Manual Noriega was also a target of American military forces during the US invasion of Panama from December 1989 to January 1990, partially prompted by his attempt to annul the results of the 1989 Panamanian general election. US courts had charged Noriega with drug smuggling and money laundering, and the Panamanian official was captured in January 1990 and taken to Miami, where he was convicted on most of the charges.\n\nBoth Noriega and Maduro were heads of state indicted by US federal courts, they were accused of using state power to facilitate drug trafficking, and the US could argue in both cases those actions taken against them were law enforcement.\n\nThe US has also conducted military action to kill prominent foreign figures. Exactly six years ago, US military personnel successfully assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military officer, in a drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nThe US designated Soleimani a terrorist in 2005. In response to Soleimani's assassination in January 2020, Iran launched missiles against US military bases in Iraq, injuring 110 US troops.\n\nMaduro and his wife are on their way to New York. Pamela Bondi, US attorney general, said that Maduro had been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, as well as conspiracy against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said on X.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump posted a picture of Maduro in custody on Truth Social. The photo showed Maduro aboard USS Iwo Jima.\n\nThe president also added that US oil companies would be returning to Venezuela.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's pressure campaign against Venezuela is reminiscent of the U.S.'s catastrophic invasion of Iraq, as it relies on exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats to justify its actions, potentially leading to the same disastrous consequences.",
    "fullText": "Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard rappelled from a helicopter onto the deck of the Centuries, an oil tanker that had last left port in Venezuela. It was the second Venezuelan-linked tanker detained by U.S. forces in the Caribbean in December, while a third tanker was sought by the U.S Coast Guard.\n\nThe seizures were framed as routine enforcement of sanctions. But to many observers, they looked like something else: a crude show of force that revived uncomfortable memories of how easily oil, security, and moral justification blur when Washington wants war.\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign against Venezuela, it is becoming increasingly clear that the only lessons America absorbed from its catastrophic invasion of Iraq were the wrong ones.\n\nThe White House’s deadliest error is its indulgence in motivated reasoning. Like the Bush administration before it, Trump’s administration is seemingly placing his enthusiasm for toppling a dictator over facts or strategic planning.\n\nThe administration recently labelled fentanyl a chemical “weapon of mass destruction” — echoing the falsehood that George W. Bush used to drag the U.S. into Iraq in 2003. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since accused Nicolás Maduro of working with “narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists” — reviving memories of George W. Bush’s unfounded obsession with an alliance between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.\n\nThis rhetoric comes amid allegations of human rights violations over the administration’s drone campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats from Venezuela. Last month, Trump said he was not ruling out war. It is tempting to conclude that our leaders learned nothing from Iraq. The truth is darker. They learned that exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats can still work.\n\nNow that cynical logic is being aimed at a neighbor in the Americas. Latin America is no stranger to Washington’s interventions, but recycling the rhetorical playbook of the most catastrophic blunder in modern U.S. history signals to the region — and to the world — that America remains unable, or unwilling, to control its worst instincts.\n\nPolitical memory is short, but the costs of the Iraq War were enormous. While the initial invasion was swift and militarily successful, what followed was nearly a decade of violent counterinsurgency, in which more than 4,400 American servicemembers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed — mainly civilians.\n\nYet the lesson U.S. leaders appear to have drawn is not that wars like Iraq should be rare, limited and meticulously planned. Instead, they learned that no administration remains in power forever, and that a president can claim the initial victory while leaving the eventual reckoning to a successor.\n\nIn Iraq, shamefully little attention was paid to planning for what came beyond President George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state created power vacuums that spawned and nurtured extremist pro-Saddam militias, al-Qaeda in Iraq, and eventually ISIS.\n\nThe deeper lesson was not merely that invasion breeds instability, but that ungoverned spaces accelerate extremist ideology and transnational violence.\n\nThe same dynamic could unfold in Venezuela. Latin America has a long history of insurgency, from FARC in Colombia, the Zapatistas in Mexico, and the Shining Path in Peru. Just as disbanded Ba’athist forces gravitated towards militias and terror groups after 2004, fractured Venezuelan security forces could easily be absorbed into criminal-terrorist ecosystems that already exist. Under Maduro, Venezuela has worked with Colombian guerrilla groups and illicit trafficking networks, while cultivating ties with Hezbollah.\n\nVenezuela presents some risks even greater than Iraq. The Maduro regime is recruiting and arming militias, and preparing troops for a guerrilla war.\n\nWhen Iraq collapsed and the army disbanded, al-Qaeda wasted little time in recruiting newly unemployed soldiers. It is in this space that organizations such as the Muslim World League have sought to intervene globally — not as security actors, but as religious authorities capable of challenging extremist narratives at their root.\n\nUnder the leadership of its Secretary-General, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the Muslim World League has focused on stripping violent movements of religious legitimacy by building cross-sectarian consensus against the politicization of faith. Its 2019 Charter of Makkah — endorsed by more than 1,200 Sunni, Shia, and minority-sect scholars from 139 countries — explicitly rejects religious supremacy, sectarian violence, and the use of theology to justify terror. That effort reflects lessons drawn from conflicts like Iraq, where the collapse of state authority was compounded by the absence of a shared moral framework capable of resisting extremist capture.\n\nVenezuela lacks an equivalent religious or institutional counterweight. An intervention would risk repeating Iraq’s gravest mistake: tearing down a state in an environment already primed for extremist and criminal consolidation.\n\nThe cautionary lessons that should have restrained American power are instead being rewritten as a playbook for war. The administration is selling the illusion of strength for short-term political gain, at the cost of American credibility, stability and lives.\n\nIraq should have ended this way of thinking. Venezuela suggests it never did.\n\nPaulina Velasco is chief of staff for the Los Angeles City Council and a Democratic political strategist. She is also a journalist who has been published in The Hill, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and Dallas Morning News, among others.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s habit of bragging about acing multiple cognitive tests may have accidentally confirmed everyone’s worst fears about the state of his health.\n\nAppearing on MS NOW, Dr. Vin Gupta discussed the president’s latest boast, the 79-year-old gloating yet again about scoring “100%” on a third cognitive examination in a Friday Truth Social post.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” the president wrote.\n\n“This is not the flex he thinks it is,” Gupta, medical analyst for NBC News and former chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy, said. “You don’t do this every other day and use that as evidence that you’re cognitively there.”\n\n“Those that tend to do Montreal [Cognitive Assessment Tool, or MOCA] tests with that level of frequency, usually we’re worried about the presence of early-stage dementia or cognitive impairment, so he might be ruling himself in to something that he doesn’t want to rule himself into.”\n\nThe president has faced increasing speculation surrounding his cognitive health during his second term, with multiple medical experts and Trump’s own niece suggesting that his decline is readily apparent.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner has previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that undertaking the same cognitive assessment multiple times suggests that his doctors are not assessing dementia, but monitoring it.\n\n“You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCA once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you’re giving it to him three times, that means you’re not assessing dementia. That means you’re monitoring dementia,” Gartner said.\n\nGartner has previously pointed to the president’s increasingly erratic behavior as evidence of his cognitive decline.\n\n“When people develop dementia, they become the worst versions of themselves,” he told the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles in November.\n\n“Whatever personality issues or problems [people with dementia] have begin to deteriorate and they become even more crude, disorganized, aggressive, confused versions of that personality disorder,” Gartner added.\n\nCaginess from the White House has only exacerbated speculation about the president’s health, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly declining to provide journalists or the American public with details of the president’s medical assessments.\n\nAfter the president himself blurted out in October that he had undergone an MRI during a physical examination, the White House initially declined to explain why. Eventually, in December, they claimed that it was a “preventative” measure due to his age—a claim medical experts immediately began to question.\n\n“There really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN in December. “This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging.”\n\nTrump has also regularly been seen with bruises on his hand—something the White House has blamed on frequent handshakes plus a daily aspirin regimen—and swollen ankles, likely the result of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis, both of which have added to concerns about his fitness for office, as has his seeming tendency to take naps during official meetings.\n\nIn January 2025, Trump—who regularly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office—became the oldest president to take the oath of office.\n\nIn December, he posted a lengthy rant to Truth Social in which he argued that it was “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” to discuss his health.\n\n“After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,’” he wrote in response to a wave of fresh concern about his seemingly declining health.",

Attorney General Pam Bondi later said Maduro and Flores were indicted on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\nIn comments aired on state television and radio, Maduro alleged that U.S. forces attacked civilian and military sites in Venezuela’s capital of Caracas, as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to The Miami Herald.\n\n\"This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela,\" Maduro reportedly said as he stood alongside military and government officials. \"It is an attempt to impose a colonial war and force political change by violence.\"\n\nLive Updates: Trump Confirms Overnight Strikes In Venezuela, Says Us Has ‘Captured’ Maduro\n\nMaduro also described the U.S. actions as a \"grave military aggression\" and violation of the United Nations charter, adding that it threatened peace across Latin America and the Caribbean, The Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe U.S. has been carrying out a military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in recent months.\n\nMaria Corina Machado Emerges As Top Potential Successor After Maduro's Fall\n\nMaduro’s government cast the U.S. strikes on Saturday as part of a larger American effort to seize Venezuela’s oil and mineral reserves, according to The Miami Herald.\n\nThe newspaper reported that state TV broadcasted images of Venezuelan soldiers deploying to strategic infrastructure and officials holding emergency meetings.\n\nAs part of Maduro’s response, he also signed a decree that declared a nationwide state of \"external disturbance,\" which gives his government sweeping powers during emergencies, including mobilizing security forces and limiting certain civil liberties, The Miami Herald added.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Follow here for the latest developments on Saturday, January 3, 2026:\n\nVenezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello vowed on Saturday that Caracas \"will overcome\" the US military strikes.\n\nSpeaking to a local TV broadcast, Cabello said: \"This is not our first battle ... we have managed to survive under all circumstances.\"\n\nCabello is considered one of the most powerful men in Venezuela.\n\nOil production and refining at PDVSA, Venezuela's state-run energy company, were operating normally on Saturday despite the US strikes, Reuters news agency reported, citing two unnamed sources.\n\nPDVSA's most important facilities suffered no damage from the strikes, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations added.\n\nOne of the sources was cited by Reuters as saying the port of La Guaira suffered severe damage. The port is among the country's largest, near Caracas, but it is not used for oil operations.\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Ministry announced it was seeking a United Nations Security Council meeting to address the US strikes.\n\n\"Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the location of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was unknown, after US President Trump said they were captured and flown out of the country.\n\nThe European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas said the bloc called for restraint after the latest events in Venezuela.\n\n\"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,\" Kallas said in a post on X. \"Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected.\"\n\nThe vice president of the European Commission said she had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and that the bloc, like many other European countries, was \"closely monitoring\" the situation.\n\n\"The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority,\" she said.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei celebrated the news about the US having captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"Freedom advances,\" Milei, a staunch Trump supporter and ally, wrote in Spanish on X, reacting to a post announcing Maduro's capture. \"Long live freedom.\"\n\nGermany was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern, the German Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.\n\nThe ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team was scheduled to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nColombia is deploying military forces to the Venezuelan border, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said. The deployment comes after US strikes on the neighboring country.\n\nThe decision followed a National Security Council meeting held to discuss the US strikes.\n\nPetro condemned the strikes as an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, warning of a humanitarian crisis. He said support forces will also be deployed to the border in the event of an influx of asylum seekers.\n\nSpain has offered to mediate for a \"peaceful solution\" in Venezuela in reaction to the US strikes.\n\nThe Spanish Foreign Ministry called in a statement for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in Venezuela.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared \"a new dawn for Venezuela\" after US strikes on the country and the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"The tyrant is gone. He will now—finally—face justice for his crimes,\" Landau said in a post on X.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that it was deeply worried over the US \"act of armed aggression\" against Venezuela.\n\n\"In the current ‌situation, ⁠it is important... to prevent further escalation ‍and to focus ​on ​finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a ‍statement.\n\n\"Ideological hostility has triumphed over businesslike pragmatism,\" said the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which has defended the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now nearing its fourth year.\n\nIn an audio address on state TV, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the location of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was unknown. US President Trump said they were captured and flown out of the country.\n\n\"We demand proof of life,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nVenezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said in a video on Saturday that the country will resist the presence of foreign troops, announcing a \"massive deployment\" of military resources.\n\nHe said some of the US strikes hit civilian areas, adding that Venezuela was compiling data about the victims.\n\nMedia reports cited unnamed US officials as saying Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured by US special forces troops.\n\nUnnamed US officials told CBS News that members of Delta Force, a US military top special mission unit, captured the Venezuelan president. This is the same force that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the so-called Islamic State, in 2019.\n\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday that the US had \"successfully\" carried out what he called a \"large-scale\" strike against Venezuela. In a social media post he added that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were \"captured and flown out of the Country.\"\n\n\"This operation was done in conjunction with US Law Enforcement,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that a press conference on the strike will be held later on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, at 4 p.m. UTC/GMT.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

Caracas has maintained that Washington's true goal is to overthrow the Venezuelan government.\n\n\"Far from a supposed fight against narcoterrorism, this deplorable action seeks to definitively force a regime change,\" Padrino added of the strikes on Saturday.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted the White House and the Pentagon for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "2025 was supposed to be a big year for American manufacturing.\n\nIndeed, boosting US-made goods was a key priority of President Donald Trump's trade war, which led to wild swings in tariff rates on imported products.\n\nNearly a year later, the actual changes to consumer behavior aren't entirely clear.\n\nFor starters, many retailers worked quickly to order merchandise ahead of tariff deadlines and found alternate sources of comparable goods to secure lower duties.\n\nA particular challenge for brands that manufacture products in the US is that many still rely on imported materials or equipment, which have seen cost increases related to tariffs.\n\nOne entrepreneur who wanted to make a better grill scrubber discovered firsthand how hard — and expensive — it was to make a product entirely with an exclusively American supply chain.\n\nAnother gave shoppers the choice between otherwise identical shower heads: an imported version and an American-made one that cost nearly twice as much. No one bought the higher-priced product.\n\nOf course, neither industrial nor consumer behaviors change overnight.\n\nWith enough time and investment, some CEOs believe US manufacturing can make a comeback.\n\nAs things stand now, however, tariffs have largely settled at an average rate of around 15%, and consumers appear to be reluctantly accepting the higher prices. There's also the issue of unresolved legal challenges to much of Trump's authority to apply many of the tariffs that he did.\n\nSo, as a new year begins, will shoppers choose more American-made products, and will that be enough to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing?\n\nTake our survey to help us find out.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.\n\nThe White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.\n\nBeijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders’ strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance” in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would “further deepen the friendly relations” between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.\n\nTakaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nThe two exchanged views “mainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.\n\nChina's military drills off Taiwan also came after the Trump administration announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion. If approved by Congress, it would represent the largest such aid to the island ever — a move criticized sharply by China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to seize it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter any attack from the mainland.\n\nTrump on Monday said he was not informed of the exercises in advance but still touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October, shortly after she took office. The two exchanged warm words, and Trump took her with him when he spoke to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan.\n\nAfter Takaichi's Taiwan comments angered Beijing, Trump called her and said they were “extremely good friends” and that she should call him any time, according to the Japanese leader, without disclosing if the two talked about her remarks.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

    "fullText": "After President Donald Trump expanded the travel ban he put in place during his first term in the White House to 20 more countries and the Palestinian Authority last December, at least three other nations responded in turn with visa bans for Americans.\n\nOn Dec. 26, the West African nation of Niger announced that it was \"completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States.\"\n\nAfter it was included in the list of countries whose citizens are completely banned from entering the U.S. last June, the government of Chad similarly announced that it was acting upon \"principles of reciprocity and suspend[ing] the granting of visas to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nAs of January 2026, 39 countries now face either a full travel ban or restrictions on various types of visas for entering the United States.\n\nThe latest country to respond is the West African nation of Burkina Faso. A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.  “This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nThe complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.\n\n“This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Postal Service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.\n\nFor instance, the Postal Service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "title": "As Trump takes 2 hard swings at Americans with student loan debt, some are discovering a surprising way out",
    "description": "The student loan system feels increasingly unstable and that uncertainty is driving more people to look for relief.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is taking a harder line on Americans with student loan debt, and borrowers are feeling it from two sides.\n\nOn the one front, the U.S. Department of Education has slammed the brakes on income-driven repayment (1). In August alone, 327,955 applications were denied, according to a Dec. 15 court filing (2). For borrowers who were counting on those plans to cap their monthly bills and eventually erase remaining balances, the fallout is immediate: higher payments or a limbo-like forbearance where interest keeps piling up while relief stays out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the government is preparing to restart wage garnishment for borrowers in default as early as January (3). Millions of people are already more than 270 days behind on their loans, putting them at risk of having part of their paycheck seized after a 30-day notice.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nOnline, frustration is boiling over. One Reddit user wrote (4), “Mine will be nearly $500 a month which is literally impossible for me to pay. I just laugh at it now because simply no way I can afford that. If I tried, my parents and I would be dead before I pay even a quarter of what I owe. It’s a joke.”\n\nAmid the tightening screws, however, a surprising escape hatch is opening. Student loans have long been considered nearly impossible to wipe out through bankruptcy — but that assumption might be outdated.\n\nBorrowers who pursue bankruptcy relief are succeeding at rates few would have believed just a decade ago. An analysis by University of Utah law professor Jason Iuliano (5) found filers now manage to discharge some or all of their student debt 87% of the time through bankruptcy, up from 61% in 2017, largely due to a streamlined legal process introduced three years ago.\n\n“That’s strikingly high when you think about the narrative being it’s impossible to discharge,” Iuliano told The New York Times (6). His findings were published this month in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal, following 15 years of research.\n\nThe shift comes as financial pressure on borrowers continues to grow. A survey from the Institute for College Access and Success found 42% of borrowers are forced to choose between student loan payments and basic necessities, while 20% are delinquent or already in default (7). Even though the Biden administration canceled $183.6 billion in loans for more than 5 million borrowers, broader forgiveness efforts have stalled (8).",

    "description": "Student-loan borrowers will begin to see the effects of Trump's changes to repayment and borrowing in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "The new year is bringing a host of new changes for millions of student-loan borrowers.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the student-loan provisions signed into law in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation are set to begin taking effect. Those provisions include rolling out new student-loan repayment plans, new borrowing caps, and eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans, which could result in higher monthly payments for borrowers.\n\nHere's what the Trump administration has in store for student-loan repayment in 2026.\n\nBeginning in July, the Department of Education plans to begin its process of eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan.\n\nThe standard repayment plan would set fixed payments for borrowers over a 10 to 25-year period based on the borrower's original balance. The Repayment Assistance Plan would serve as the income-based option for borrowers; it would set payments at 1% to 10% of the borrower's income, with a minimum monthly payment of $10 and forgiveness after 30 years.\n\nIt's less generous than the existing income-based repayment plan, which forgives balances after 20 or 25 years, and former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which would forgive balances after as few as 10 years of payments.\n\nBorrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2026, will have until 2028 to enroll in RAP before the other plans phase out. Borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, will only have RAP and the standard repayment plan as available repayment options.\n\nIn addition to new repayment plans, Trump's spending legislation eliminated the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nIt also implemented new borrowing caps for borrowers seeking advanced degrees. Graduate students would have a cap of $20,500 a year or $100,000 over a lifetime, and professional students would have a cap of $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime.\n\nThe Department of Education also proposed instituting a revised definition of a \"professional\" program, which included 10 programs that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap, including medicine, law, and dentistry. The new definition was a key point of contention with stakeholders who negotiated the terms with the department because the revised definition leaves out advanced programs like nursing, some of which have tuition that is above the proposed caps.\n\nTrump's spending legislation included eliminating the SAVE plan as part of its phase-out of existing income-driven repayment plans by 2028. However, his administration announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri in December that would end the SAVE plan as soon as the court approves the settlement.\n\nIt means that the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE would have a limited period of time to find a new repayment plan and restart their monthly payments at a higher amount. Additionally, the department said that it would deny pending applications to SAVE, which would include 450,000 borrowers who have expressed interest in enrolling in the plan.\n\nThe Department of Education is expanding eligibility for income-based repayment plans by removing the requirement of partial financial hardship. Prior to Trump's spending legislation, borrowers seeking to enroll in an IBR plan were required to have a monthly payment based on their income that was less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over 10 years.\n\nRemoving that requirement, which the department said would be completed in December 2025, means that borrowers with higher incomes would be eligible to enroll in IBR. Additionally, the department said that servicers would hold IBR applications that would otherwise be denied, and the applications would be processed once the updates to IBR were completed.",

    "fullText": "Trump Media & Technology Group shareholders may be receiving a late Christmas gift shortly after the 2025 holiday season, though the exact date isn't clear.\n\nThe Truth Social parent has announced plans to issue a new crypto to its investor base. In a company statement released on Wednesday, December 31, the company revealed that it will distribute the token in partnership with Crypto.com and that it will operate on the Cronos blockchain.\n\nWhile the statement noted that Trump Media expects each DJT shareholder to receive one token for every share they hold, no specific timing has been provided yet. The company also said that those who receive these tokens may also be given rewards in the coming year, which may include discounts on company products.\n\nThis decision comes at a time when digital assets with ties to the Trump name have struggled significantly and are facing increasing scrutiny from both finance pros and investors. The Trump family lost roughly $1 billion in the recent crypto market meltdown, primarily due to bitcoin's steep decline and the $Trump meme coin falling sharply. American Bitcoin Corp, a company in which Eric Trump is a primary shareholder, has struggled significantly since its September IPO, falling 14% year-to-date.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to struggle, this new crypto offering, intended to reward Trump Media shareholders after a difficult year, may raise some questions. Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, noted that it is entering the market at a less-than-ideal time.\n\n\"Projects like this are entering a much more skeptical market,\" he told Business Insider. \"Investors already have many ways to get crypto exposure, and spreading a strategy across multiple Trump-linked vehicles risks diluting demand rather than concentrating it.\"\n\n$Trump coin's recent performance may also raise concern, as it could be viewed as an indication of instability for the new crypto. The meme coin has fallen 14% over the past month. Meanwhile, the $MELANIA Trump meme coin plunged shortly after its launch in January 2025 and is down 94% for the year.\n\nLi also noted that the world of crypto is ever-changing and with it, the rules that drive the volatile market. In his view, the last crypto cycle was dominated by narratives, as real economic activity was constrained by regulation. But the market has shifted since then and the outlook is starkly different.\n\n\"The lines are blurring, but investors are far more discerning than last cycle, and simply copying what worked before will not be enough,\" he added.\n\nTrump's pro-crypto policies helped boost markets earlier in 2025 as investors viewed it as lending stability to the notoriously volatile asset class, cheering the easing of regulatory roadblocks. But with the year ending on a low note, it is unclear how a crypto created to reward shareholders in a struggling stock will be received.",

    "fullText": "FILE – President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Aug. 15, 2025. \n\nOn Tuesday, Russian broadcaster and propagandist Vladimir Solovyov said on his show that Russian President Vladimir Putin “achieved a knockout victory” prior to the latest meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian leadership, claiming that a phone call that took place between President Donald Trump and Putin “completely destroyed [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky’s plans.”\n\nTrump met with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, where he said they were “very close” to a peace deal in the four-year Russia-Ukraine war, adding that there are still “1-2 thorny issues,” one of which is land that remains ”up for grabs.”\n\nZelensky agreed, saying the two leaders agreed on 90% of his 20-point peace plan.\n\nOn Tuesday night’s episode of Evening with Vladimir Solovyov, the Kremlin promoter said, “We have achieved a knockout victory. We prepared on a grandmaster’s level on all the main points, and it worked.”\n\n“Everything was extremely precise, and of course, Zelensky started to melt,” Solovyov added. “He melted down… The mood just wasn’t there.”\n\nAs Trump mentioned on Sunday, he and Putin were on the phone for more than two hours shortly before Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago. He told reporters, “Russia wants it ended, everybody wants it ended,” and that the Russian president “wants to see” a peace deal finalized soon.\n\nTrump also added that he planned to call Putin again after Zelensky’s departure.\n\nAccording to Solovyov’s Tuesday commentary, the phone call between Moscow and Palm Beach “completely destroyed Zelensky’s plans.” He went as far as to insinuate that there was no point in the Ukrainian president even getting off the plane.\n\nJust last Saturday, in a move that directly counters Putin’s alleged willingness to move towards peace, Russia hammered Ukraine’s capital city with missiles and attack drones, injuring at least 11 people and leaving almost a third of Kyiv without heat.\n\nThe post ‘Knockout Victory’: Russian Broadcaster Says Trump-Putin Call ‘Completely Destroyed Zelensky’s Plans’ Before Meeting first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "14 Unflattering Things Trumps’ Staff Have Revealed About Him",
    "description": "Trump's staff has shared these secret (and really unflattering) things about him.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s public persona is loud, forceful, and relentlessly self-assured. But behind closed doors, former aides, advisors, and staffers—many of whom were loyal until they weren’t—have painted a far less flattering picture. Through interviews, books, testimony, and off-the-record accounts, a pattern emerges that’s less about ideology and more about temperament, impulse, and management style. What follows isn’t rumor or partisan caricature. It’s what people who worked closest to him say they witnessed firsthand.\n\nMultiple former staffers have described how Trump would disengage from intelligence briefings if the information contradicted his instincts or preferred narrative. Reports indicate he often skimmed written materials, asked for his name to be highlighted, or redirected conversations toward topics that interested him more. Complex or nuanced information frustrated him, particularly if it required patience or follow-up.\n\nWhat disturbed aides wasn’t disagreement—it was disinterest. Decisions were sometimes made without fully absorbing the underlying facts. For a president, that pattern alarmed staff who understood the stakes. The issue wasn’t skepticism; it was selective attention.\n\nFormer aides have said Trump fostered competition and confusion by giving conflicting instructions to different people. Rather than clarifying chains of command, he often encouraged rivalries and rewarded whoever delivered results—or praise—fastest. This created an environment where loyalty mattered more than coordination.\n\nStaffers described a culture of anxiety, where information was hoarded and alliances shifted constantly. The lack of internal trust made consistent policy execution difficult. Chaos wasn’t a side effect—it was baked into how the workplace functioned.\n\nAccounts from former staff consistently point to Trump’s fixation on optics. He reportedly monitored television coverage obsessively, tracked crowd sizes, and demanded immediate rebuttals to perceived slights. Staff were often tasked with managing not policy outcomes, but emotional reactions to media narratives.\n\nThis preoccupation shaped priorities. Decisions were sometimes evaluated based on how they would “look” rather than how they would function. For aides trying to manage governance, image frequently overrode substance.\n\nFormer staffers have said Trump struggled to separate criticism of his actions from attacks on his identity. Pushback—even internal—was often interpreted as betrayal. This made honest counsel risky, especially when delivering bad news.\n\nAs a result, aides learned to soften language or avoid raising concerns altogether. The feedback loop narrowed over time. Staff who challenged him tended not to last, reinforcing an echo chamber around his preferences.\n\nSeveral former officials have described Trump as highly impressionable in the moment. A persuasive conversation, cable news segment, or trusted voice could dramatically shift his stance—sometimes within hours. Consistency was difficult to maintain.\n\nThis volatility frustrated staff tasked with implementing decisions that might reverse without warning. Policy became fluid not because of new evidence, but because of new influence. For insiders, it created constant instability.\n\nStaff accounts suggest Trump oscillated between detachment and intrusion. He often avoided detailed oversight, then suddenly intervened in minor decisions that caught his attention. This unpredictability made planning difficult.\n\nAides were left guessing which issues would trigger involvement. Large-scale strategy might receive little input, while trivial details drew intense focus. The imbalance weakened organizational coherence.\n\nMany former staffers have said Trump prized personal loyalty above expertise. Advisors who defended him publicly or flattered him privately were often elevated, even if they lacked relevant experience. Conversely, qualified staff who contradicted him were sidelined.\n\nThis dynamic shaped hiring, retention, and internal culture. Competence mattered less than allegiance. Over time, this narrowed the pool of voices willing—or able—to operate effectively within his orbit.\n\nFormer aides have said Trump preferred clear winners and losers, simple explanations, and immediate outcomes. Issues that required nuance, patience, or long-term tradeoffs often lost his attention quickly. Staff learned that presenting layered analysis could backfire if it felt too abstract or unresolved.\n\nThis made governing in a complex global system especially difficult. Problems that didn’t lend themselves to simple framing were either delayed or oversimplified. The discomfort with ambiguity pushed decision-making toward blunt solutions, even when the situation demanded precision.\n\nNumerous staffers have described the shock of being contradicted, corrected, or criticized by Trump in public settings, including press conferences and on social media. Statements made internally would be reversed without warning. Loyalty did not guarantee protection from public rebuke.\n\nThis behavior eroded internal trust and credibility. Aides struggled to represent administration positions confidently, knowing they could be disavowed at any moment. The unpredictability weakened both morale and authority.\n\nStaff accounts often describe Trump approaching the presidency as an extension of branding rather than administration. Rallies, television appearances, and crowd response carried disproportionate weight in shaping his priorities. Governing tasks that lacked spectacle received less enthusiasm.\n\nThis blurred the line between leadership and entertainment. Policy became secondary to audience reaction. For aides focused on outcomes rather than optics, the imbalance was a constant source of friction.\n\nFormer insiders have noted that Trump reacted defensively to information that portrayed him as uninformed, wrong, or at fault. Briefings that contradicted his self-perception were often dismissed or reframed. Admitting error was seen as a weakness rather than a course correction.\n\nThis limited adaptive learning. Mistakes were harder to acknowledge, and strategies harder to revise. Staff learned that protecting ego was often necessary to keep conversations moving forward at all.\n\nMany aides have described the pace of work as relentless and reactive. Emergencies were frequent, often driven by Trump’s own statements or actions. Staff spent enormous energy responding to self-created crises rather than advancing long-term goals.\n\nThe environment left little room for stability or reflection. Burnout was common, turnover high. For many insiders, survival replaced strategy as the primary focus.\n\nFormer staffers have said Trump was quick to claim credit for perceived successes but distanced himself from failures. Blame was often redirected toward aides, opponents, or external forces. Accountability flowed downward, not upward.\n\nThis shaped internal dynamics sharply. Staff learned that proximity to power carried risk as well as prestige. Mistakes—real or perceived—could end careers abruptly.\n\nPerhaps the most consistent thread across post-White House interviews is emotional exhaustion. Even aides who supported Trump’s goals described feeling worn down by volatility, unpredictability, and constant tension. The job demanded not just labor, but emotional regulation.\n\nFor many, leaving wasn’t ideological—it was psychological. The cumulative effect of chaos, loyalty tests, and public exposure took a lasting toll. What staff revealed afterward wasn’t bitterness so much as relief.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is not the first president to want more room at the White House for entertaining, says the longest-serving top aide in the executive residence, offering some backup for the reason Trump has cited for his ballroom construction project.\n\nGary Walters spent more than two decades as White House chief usher to presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — a role that is akin to being the general manager of the residence.\n\n“All the presidents that I had an opportunity to serve always talked about some possibility of an enlarged area” for entertaining, Walters said in an interview with The Associated Press about his recently published memoir.\n\nTrump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years, even before he entered the political arena. In July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.\n\nThe Republican president later upped the proposed ballroom’s capacity to 999 people and, by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he updated the price tag to $400 million — double the original estimate.\n\n“So there's always been construction going on around the White House,” Walters said.\n\nOther presidents bemoaned the lack of space for entertaining\n\nWhen Walters was on the job, the capacity of the largest public rooms in the White House was among the first topics he discussed with the incoming president, first lady and their social secretary, he said. The presidents he served all talked about the limited number of people the White House could handle.\n\nWhen set up for a state dinner, the State Dining Room can hold about 130 people: 13 round tables each with seating for 10, Walters said. The East Room can accommodate about 300 chairs — fewer if space is needed for television cameras.\n\nTrump complains often that both rooms are too small. He also has complained about the use of large tents on the south grounds, the main workaround for big events such as ritzy state dinners for foreign leaders. Walters said the tents had issues.\n\n“When it rained, the water flows downhill and the grass became soggy, no matter what we tried to do,” Walters said. “We dug culverts around the outside of the tent to try and get the water.\" Tents damaged the grass, requiring more work to reseed it, he said.\n\nWalters admitted it was a bit jarring to see the East Wing torn down, and said he had fond personal memories of the space. “I met my wife at the White House and she worked in the East Wing, so that was a joy for me,” said Walters, 79.\n\nHis wife, Barbara, was a receptionist in the visitors office during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The couple recently celebrated 48 years of marriage.\n\nBroken bones alter usher's career trajectory\n\nWalters owes his place in history as the longest-serving White House chief usher to the misfortune of a broken ankle.\n\nHe was 23 in early 1970, honorably discharged from the Army and looking for a job that would allow him to finish college at night. The Executive Protective Service, a precursor to the U.S. Secret Service, was hiring and accepted him.\n\nBut shortly before the graduation ceremony, Walters broke an ankle playing football. He could not patrol out of uniform, wearing a cast and hobbling around on crutches, so he was given a temporary assignment in the White House Police Control and Appointments Center. He stayed for five years.\n\n“This injury also changed the course of my career,” Walters wrote in his memoir, “White House Memories: 1970-2007: Recollections of the Longest-Serving Chief Usher.” He gained an ”in-depth knowledge of the ways and security systems of the White House that would ultimately greatly benefit me in my future role in the Usher's Office.\"\n\nA few months after being promoted to sergeant in 1975, he learned of an opening in the Usher's Office. He applied and joined as an assistant in early 1976.\n\nA decade later, he was elevated to chief usher by Reagan, who gave Walters the top job in the residence overseeing maintenance, construction and renovation projects, and food service, along with administrative, financial and personnel functions. He managed a staff of about 90 butlers, housekeepers, cooks, florists, electricians, engineers, plumbers and others.\n\nWalters retired in 2007 after 37 years at the White House, including a record 21 years as chief usher. He served under seven presidents, from Nixon to George W. Bush.\n\nIn that time, Walters saw a broad swath of presidential history: the only president who ever resigned, an appointed vice president become the only unelected president, a president be impeached and stay in office, a father and son become president and the Supreme Court decide the most closely contested presidential election in U.S. history.\n\nHe's often asked what he liked most about his work and “without hesitation I say it is getting to know and interact directly with the president, first lady, and other members of their family. It was an honor to get to know them with my own eyes and ears,” Walters wrote.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump excoriated Colorado Governor Jared Polis and a Republican district attorney from the Centennial State on Wednesday, even going so far as to instruct them to “rot in hell.”\n\n“God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison, at the age of 73, and sick, for the ‘crime’ of trying to stop the massive voter fraud that goes on in her State ( where people are leaving in record numbers!),” began Trump in a post on Truth Social. “Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting ‘Republican’ (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETTERS!”\n\nPeters, the former clerk for Colorado’s Mesa County, is serving nine years in prison for seven state-level charges pertaining to election interference back in 2020. Using her public capacity, Peters gave an associate of MyPillow CEO and Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Mike Lindell access to Mesa County election software. The counts against her include three of “attempting to influence a public servant” and one of criminal impersonation.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump claimed to have pardoned Peters in another Truth Social post that read:\n\nFor years, Democrats ignored Violent and Vicious Crime of all shapes, sizes, colors, and types. Violent Criminals who should have been locked up were allowed to attack again. Democrats were also far too happy to let in the worst from the worst countries so they could rip off American Taxpayers. Democrats only think there is one crime – Not voting for them! Instead of protecting Americans and their Tax Dollars, Democrats chose instead to prosecute anyone they can find that wanted Safe and Secure Elections. Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest. Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the “crime” of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!\n\nPeters is unable to be pardoned by the president for state-level crimes.\n\nThe post Trump Tells ‘Scumbag’ Governor and ‘Disgusting’ ‘RINO’ to ‘Rot in Hell’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital.\n\nThe National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\n\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\n\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.\n\n“While this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation’s capital for generations to come,” the officials added.\n\nThe Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety. The Kennedy Center added Trump's name this month after the center's board of trustees — made up of Trump appointees — voted to change the name of the performing arts space designated by Congress as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. Trump is also in the midst of a construction project to build a ballroom on the White House's East Wing, and he has put his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace.",

    "fullText": "You won't be able to record any New Year's Eve festivities on a Trump phone.\n\nThough Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — the president's two oldest sons — initially said that the gold-colored smartphone would come out in August, a Trump Mobile customer service representative told Business Insider that the phone won't be shipped until the end of January 2026, a delay they partially attributed to the recent government shutdown. The development was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nThe brothers first announced Trump Mobile, the line of Trump-branded smartphones, on June 16, the 10-year anniversary of President Donald Trump's first presidential campaign launch. The $499 gold-colored T1 smartphone largely resembles modern Android devices, and was originally advertised as being made in the US — drawing questions from the tech community on how the company would hit that price point without relying on foreign part or supply chains.\n\nWithin days of the launch, the \"MADE IN THE USA\" wording was removed from the Trump Mobile website. The phone is now simply described as \"brought to life right here in the USA\" and made with \"American hands.\" Trump has previously threatened Apple with tariffs if the company doesn't shift iPhone manufacturing to the US, though some think that fully recreating the production domestically is nearly impossible.\n\nTrump Mobile is also offering the \"47 Plan,\" which would provide services like unlimited texting, calling, and data, roadside assistance, and even tele-health services, for $47.45 per month — a reference to Trump's status as both the 45th and 47th president of the United States.\n\nAmid its missed launch window, the company has also started selling secondhand phones from Samsung and Apple for between $369 and $629.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump Mobile's X account has lain dormant for four months — the last post the company made was on August 27.\n\nSwitch to the service you deserve & keep the phone you love!\n\nMore than unlimited talk, text & data—your plan includes:\n\n🩺💻 24/7 Telehealth\n🚗🛠️ Roadside Assistance\n📱🛡️ Device Protection\n🌎📞 International Calling\n\nSame phone. Same number. Way better service.… pic.twitter.com/c8V4BdJFSt\n\nDespite the delay in the release, Trump Mobile is still accepting pre-orders for $100, with the remaining $399 charged when the phone finally arrives.",

We just had the longest one on record and now it looks like we're going to be walking into the new year with the possibility of another one. Uh, then, can you game that one out, too?\n\nYeah, happy to. I don't think that we're going to get another shutdown. I generally tend to think that we won't shut it down. The Democrats proved their point in the 45-day shutdown uh earlier this year, and I don't think the language we're getting from leader Schumer is indicative of another shutdown.\n\nUm, one of the things that I would really suggest point out is it's not necessarily about a policy win, you know, the ACA subsidies are going to expire. So you're going to be paying more for your healthcare next year. 200 bucks if you're below 40, up to $920 if you're over the age of 60. That's going to happen starting, well, I guess tonight.\n\nUm, and as we get into the end of this year, that's what the conversation is going to be, but because there's no consensus on moving forward and Democrats have made their point and Republicans are you know, guaranteeing that there will be votes and we're going to have this conversation, we'll talk about it, but I don't think we're going to shut it down. So, my odds are 25%. I think fade that. I I don't think we're going to shut down going into February.",

    "description": "The monument would be a centerpiece of the White House’s plans for America’s 250th birthday.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said in an interview Wednesday that construction of his long-teased Triumphal Arch is expected to begin “sometime in the next two months.”\n\nThat would put the start date ahead of July 4, 2026 — as the White House ramps up preparations for the nation’s 250th anniversary next year.\n\n“It hasn’t started yet. It starts sometime in the next two months. It’ll be great. Everyone loves it,” Trump told POLITICO when reached by phone from Mar-a-Lago. “They love the ballroom too. But they love the Triumphal Arch.”\n\nThe proposed structure — modeled loosely on European victory monuments — is one of several high-profile projects Trump has personally championed as part of the semiquincentennial celebrations, a sprawling effort expected to include national and local events across the country.\n\nThe president has at times displayed a model of the proposed arch in recent months. There have been plans to build it by the Lincoln Monument, on the other end of a bridge leading to Arlington National Ceremony.\n\nTrump has framed the project as a patriotic landmark meant to honor American history and military service, though critics have raised questions about cost, aesthetics and whether the executive branch has the authority to unilaterally move forward with such construction in Washington.\n\nHe has also promoted an Ultimate Fighting Championship event on White House grounds on June 14.\n\nAsked who he would want to fight at the White House UFC match, Trump deferred to UFC President Dana White, a longtime ally, to make the selections. “Well, Dana’s picking them. He’s the best fight picker there is, right?” Trump said. “He’s going to pick all of the top fighters. Going to be all championship matches. It’ll be the best ever, I think. Really incredible.”\n\nTrump said there could be “many matches, like 10,” suggesting the event would be a championship-level showcase rather than a single bout.\n\nIn a separate interview with POLITICO last week, Trump spoke about the Republican Party’s plans for the midterms, arguing the election will be about “pricing.” He also cast himself as the final decisionmaker for any peace deal in Russia’s war on Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "description": "Bylaws that would limit voting to Trump-appointed trustees appears to reveal long-held renaming plan",
    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.\n\nThe bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.\n\nTrump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).\n\nJust prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.\n\nThe center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.\n\nRoma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”\n\nDaravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”\n\nEllen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.\n\n“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.\n\nThe disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.\n\nAs artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday said his country’s answer to an attack would be harsh, which appeared to be in response to a warning by U.S. President Donald Trump over reconstruction of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging,” Pezeshkian said on the social media platform X.\n\nPezeshkian did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Trump suggested the U.S. could carry out military strikes if Iran attempts to reconstitute its nuclear program. Trump made the comment during wide-ranging talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,” Trump said during a news conference with Netanyahu after their meeting. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening.”\n\nThe two leaders discussed the possibility of renewed military action against Tehran months after a 12-day air war in June that killed nearly 1,100 Iranians including senior military commanders and scientists. Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 people in Israel.\n\nTrump suggested Monday that he could order another U.S. strike against Iran.\n\n“If it’s confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,” Trump said.\n\nPezeshkian said Saturday that tensions between the sides already had risen.\n\n“We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don’t want our country to remain stable,” he said.\n\nIran has insisted it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60%, which is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the largest protests in three years entered a third day Tuesday after the country’s currency plummeted to a record low against the U.S. dollar. The head of the Central Bank resigned on Monday.\n\nAccording to witnesses and videos on social media, rallies took place in Tehran and other cities and towns. Police fired tear gas in some places. Near a market in downtown Tehran, footage showed people pushing back police and security forces and throwing stones at them.\n\nUniversity students also rallied inside campuses on Tehran University and other major universities, witnesses said.\n\nPezeshkian met a group of businessmen to listen to their demands, media reported.\n\n\"The administration will not spare any effort for solving problems and improving situation of the society,” Pezeshkian said. He also assigned Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni for talks with protesters.\n\nThe head of the country’s tax department, Mohammad Hadi Sobhanian, also said the government will revise its tax arrangement in favor of businesses, dropping penalties for delay in paying taxes.\n\nThe government announced the closure of offices and banks on Wednesday for managing energy consumption during the winter days, to be followed by weekly holidays on Thursday and Friday. Saturday also is a religious holiday in the country.",

    "description": "Cabinet Office accused of cover-up after release of official papers referring to the King’s brother blocked",
    "fullText": "The Cabinet Office’s redaction of files relating to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been compared to the controversial treatment of the Epstein files.\n\nAndrew Lownie, a biographer of the former prince, said the decision to remove parts of the documents after they were released to journalists was “panicky”.\n\nMr Lownie, the author of Entitled, said: “It’s a bit like the Trump redactions (in the Epstein files). They’re slightly panicking and they do things without realising the consequences, trying to leave it or to play it down.\n\n“I think there’s just a huge panic. Anything to do with Andrew is being excised from the record because they’re worried about what it might reveal.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office was accused of covering up for the royal family after it emerged that official papers which refer to Andrew have been withheld from the National Archives.\n\nThe annual release of government papers under the 20-year rule to the archives in Kew, southwest London, includes a No 10 file from 2004 and 2005 on royal visits.\n\nThe version made available to journalists under embargo, so they could prepare stories in advance, included minutes of a meeting where officials discussed the travel plans of royals – including the then Duke of York, when he was a UK trade envoy.\n\nHowever, the minutes were later redacted from the file before it was released to the public.\n\nThe Cabinet Office, which is responsible for transferring the files to the National Archives, blamed an “administrative error”, saying they had never been intended for release.\n\nHowever, Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said there was no justification for withholding the documents, especially since Andrew has been stripped of his royal status amid continuing controversy over his links with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLabour MP Rachael Maskell also urged the government to provide clarity on why the files were not published.\n\nMr Lownie said all files relating to Andrew’s time as trade envoy up to 2005 should be released and called for parliament to investigate.\n\nHe told the Times: “A huge cover-up has gone on [concerning] Andrew’s excessive expenditure, little of it profiting the country, and it continues. I believe there needs to be a full parliamentary investigation into Andrew’s decade as special representative.”\n\nEarlier this month, Andrew, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was formally stripped of his last remaining royal titles following controversy over his links to Epstein.\n\nThe redacted files showed discussions by senior palace and Foreign Office officials about Andrew’s travel plans as a UK trade envoy – which earned him the nickname “air miles Andy” – with visits to China, Russia, southeast Asia and Spain.\n\nOfficials also raised the issue of whether the Football Association would be prepared to pay for him to attend the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal as a royal representative.\n\nAlison McClean, a researcher at the University of Bristol, also told the paper that the three exemptions cited by the Cabinet Office, designed to protect documents containing communications with the sovereign, as well as personal data or confidentiality, were “questionable”.\n\nMcClean added: “It seems to demonstrate how even the most innocuous material concerning even minor members of the royal family is being routinely withheld. In this case it is especially worrying that information on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities as a UK trade representative are being blocked from release to the National Archives, as this relates to his role as a public servant rather than as a member of the royal family or, indeed, as a private citizen.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office said: “All records are managed in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act. Any release is subject to an extensive review process, including engaging expert stakeholders.”",

    "description": "The president took to Truth Social hours after the Kennedy family announced their tragic loss to share posts from MAGA supporters mocking the political dynasty",
    "fullText": "In the hours following the death of Caroline Kennedy's daughter Tatiana Schlossberg, President Donald Trump took to social media to mock the famous political family\n\nOn Truth Social on the afternoon of Dec. 30, Trump shared screenshots of MAGA supporters insulting the Kennedys for their response to his recent decision to add his own name to the Kennedy Center\n\nMembers of the family have claimed that Trump is barred from renaming the center \"by federal law,\" however, work crews have already added his name above JFK's on the historic memorial site\n\nAs the Kennedys mourned the untimely death of Tatiana Schlossberg — the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy — Donald Trump took to social media to share posts mocking the famous family.\n\nTatiana, the middle child of Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, died on Tuesday, Dec. 30, at age 35, just over a month after publicly sharing that she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe news was shared by the social media accounts for the JFK Library Foundation, on behalf of Tatiana's family, which included her husband, Dr. George Moran, and their young children, Edwin and Josephine.\n\n\"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,\" read the post, which was signed by \"George, Edwin and Josephine Moran, Ed, Caroline, Jack, Rose and Rory.\"\n\nTrump did not directly mention Tatiana's death in his social media deluge following her death. Instead, he shared screenshots of MAGA supporters mocking the famous political family for their recent responses to his decision to add his name to the Kennedy Center, a historic performance venue in Washington, D.C., which was dedicated as a memorial to JFK following his assassination in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\n\"The Kennedy Family have LONG neglected the Kennedy Center, btw,\" claimed one. \"They don’t raise money for it. They never show up. And the only Kennedy who has been there recently is a member of Trump’s cabinet.\"\n\n\"The Trumps have always been supporters of the arts. The Kennedys are supporters of the Kennedys,\" read another.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Thursday, Dec. 18, that the board of the historic venue had \"voted unanimously\" to rename the building to the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\" The following day, work crews added \"The Donald Trump and\" above the previously-existing lettering, which read, \"The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nHowever, controversy quickly arose among members of the Kennedy Center board and the family itself. Tatiana's brother, Jack Schlossberg, wrote on X that \"microphones were muted\" during the conference call where the board voted, and the outcome was \"NOT unanimous.\"\n\nJack's claim aligned with comments made by Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, who serves as an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center board. Following the vote, Beatty took to X with allegations that she and other opponents of the vote were muted on the call and were not allowed to vote their differing opinions.\n\n\"For the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move,\" Beatty, 75, wrote. \"Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship.\"\n\nIn her video message, she continued, \"Clearly the Congress has a say in this. This center, the Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"\n\nOther Kennedys have approached the matter from a legal standpoint. \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" wrote Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe Kennedys have yet to respond to Trump's latest attacks. The only family members who have posted to social media in the hours following Tatiana's death have been those sharing loving tributes, like Caroline's cousin, Maria Shriver, who was directly mocked in some of Trump's screenshots.\n\n\"I return to this space today to pay tribute to my sweet, beloved Tatiana, who left this earth today,\" Shriver wrote on X. \"I return to this space to pay tribute and honor her loving and supportive family, who came together and did everything they possibly could do to help her. I return to this space heartbroken because Tatiana loved life. She loved her life, and she fought like hell to try to save it.\"\n\n\"I cannot make sense of this. I cannot make any sense of it at all. None. Zero,\" she continued. \"My heart has always been with my cousin Caroline ever since we were little kids. My entire being is with her now. What a rock she has been.\"\n\n\"Those of us left behind will make sure Eddie and Josie know what a beautiful, courageous spirit their mother was and will always be.

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "description": "Artists are canceling shows after Trump’s name went on the Kennedy Center. Ric Grenell denies the link and threatens critics to silence dissent.",
    "fullText": "The renaming of the Kennedy Center triggered immediate fallout. Artists canceled performances. Longstanding relationships fractured. Programming began disappearing from the calendar. Ric Grenell’s response has been to insist none of this is his doing, and to threaten those who say otherwise.\n\nAfter the Trump-appointed board voted to add President Donald Trump’s name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, cancellations followed quickly. A veteran jazz ensemble walked away from New Year’s Eve shows. A Christmas Eve jazz concert that had run for nearly two decades was called off. A New York dance company withdrew anniversary performances at a cost of $40,000. These were not symbolic gestures. They involved real money, professional risk, and decisions artists did not make lightly.\n\nGrenell, the Kennedy Center’s interim president/executive director and a senior Trump loyalist, responded by denying the causal relationship everyone could see. He insisted that adding Trump’s name “depoliticized” the institution. He also insisted that artists who withdrew were “far-left political activists,” acting for political reasons. In Grenell’s telling, the renaming did nothing, and the reaction proved everything.\n\nThat position requires believing that politics entered the Kennedy Center only when artists objected to the renaming, not when the renaming happened.\n\nGrenell did more than deny causality. He escalated. After Chuck Redd, the longtime host of the canceled Christmas Eve jazz concert, pulled out, Grenell publicly threatened him with a $1 million lawsuit. The message was unmistakable. Question the takeover and face consequences.\n\nThis is the point where denial turns into intimidation.\n\nThe artists who canceled did not issue partisan manifestos. The Cookers, a veteran all-star jazz septet featuring musicians with decades-long careers, spoke about jazz’s roots in freedom of expression. Doug Varone, the founder of a nationally respected contemporary dance company scheduled to mark its 40th anniversary at the center, described withdrawing as financially devastating but morally clarifying. These statements point in the same direction. The artists responded to a change in the institution itself, not to some abstract ideological grievance.\n\nGrenell’s response reframes that reality. By labeling dissenting artists extremists, he shifts attention away from the political act that set everything in motion. By threatening legal action, he discourages others from making the same connection publicly. Denial becomes policy, and enforcement follows.\n\nGrenell insists the arts are now “for everyone.” His actions define the terms of inclusion. Artists remain welcome as long as they perform without objection and accept the renaming as settled. Compliance is the price of neutrality. Artists who withdraw their labor are recast as political saboteurs. In this framework, politics is invisible when exercised by those in charge and intolerable when named by those affected.\n\nThe cost of this strategy is no longer theoretical. It is visible on the schedule. Performances have vanished. Institutions do not lose artists this way when they are perceived as neutral ground. They lose artists when trust breaks.\n\nGrenell has shamelessly argued that Trump “saved” the Kennedy Center. That claim is now testable. A saved institution does not hemorrhage programming weeks after a rebrand. A healthy cultural center does not require threats to maintain compliance. A revitalized stage does not grow quieter.\n\nThe political renaming backfired. The cancellations were the response. Grenell’s denial and intimidation are the attempt to erase that sequence.\n\nThe calendar keeps the record anyway.\n\nThe post The Trump-Kennedy Center Backfired. Ric Grenell Is Gaslighting Everyone first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "US presidents have each redecorated the Oval Office in their own unique ways since it was first built in 1909.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 100 years since the Oval Office was first built under President William Howard Taft. Throughout that time, US presidents have each made different design choices to redecorate the formal workspace.\n\nSome presidents, like President George H.W. Bush, have brought in their own furniture to replace the Resolute Desk. Others, like President Donald Trump, have reinstated vintage Oval Office pieces while adding their own personal flair.\n\nTake a look at how the Oval Office has changed through the years.\n\nInspired by the White House's oval-shaped Blue Room, the president's formal workspace was designed by architect Nathan C. Wyeth.\n\nTaft's Oval Office featured an olive-green color scheme.\n\nThe Oval Office was moved to the southeast corner of the White House.\n\nRoosevelt kept a variety of items on his desk, including photos of his sons, ceramic animal figurines, and an appointments easel with his daily schedule, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nTruman decorated the Oval Office with the turquoise rug and matching curtains. The walls were painted a lighter seafoam green.\n\nThe Resolute Desk, made of wood from the British ship H.M.S. Resolute, was gifted to President Rutherford B. Hayes by Queen Victoria in 1880. Previous presidents kept the desk in the second-floor office of the White House Residence and the Broadcast Room, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nHe also redecorated the Oval Office with white drapes with red trim, evoking the American flag.\n\nNixon's Oval Office rug, in the same blue color as the American flag, was designed by first lady Pat Nixon.\n\nFord's decor included the wheel from the SS Mayaguez, an American container ship that was seized by Cambodian forces in 1975 and rescued at Ford's direction.\n\nThe clock, built between 1795 and 1805, has remained in the Oval Office under every subsequent president since 1975.\n\nOtherwise, he left most of Ford's decor.\n\nThe rug featured the presidential seal in the center with sunbeams emerging from the middle, surrounded by a border of olive branches.\n\nThe Resolute Desk was moved to the Residence Office.\n\nHockersmith designed the yellow curtains and the blue rug with the presidential seal. Clinton also chose to bring the Resolute Desk back to the Oval Office.\n\nThe rug featured a sunbeam design with the presidential seal at its center, reminiscent of Reagan's rug, and a lone star in a nod to Bush's home state of Texas.\n\nThe quote on the border of the rug read, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n\nHe also brought back Clinton's gold curtains and chose a new off-white wallpaper.\n\nBiden hung portraits of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMany of the gold decor pieces in Trump's Oval Office came from the White House collection, but Trump also imported some statuettes from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nTrump also added flags representing different branches of the US military and additional presidential portraits, with President George Washington in the prominent center spot above the fireplace mantle.",

    "fullText": "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.\n\nBut while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.\n\nOfficials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.\n\n“This fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.\n\nUnder the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state’s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state’s population.\n\nThe formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's “Make America Healthy Again” initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.\n\nSeveral Republican-led states — including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas — have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.\n\nThe money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to “claw back” funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.\n\n“I've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.\n\nCarrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she’s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.\n\n“It’s not where their state leadership is,” she said.\n\nExperts say fund is inadequate in face of other cuts\n\nOz and other federal officials have touted the program as a 50% increase in Medicaid investments in rural health care. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration’s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.\n\n“That’s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that’s struggling,” Bacon said. “This money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.”\n\nBut experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.\n\nEstimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP’s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\n“When you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know — that math does not add up,” Cochran-McClain said.\n\nShe also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state’s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.\n\nAnd even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress’ Medicaid cuts.\n\n“We talk to rural providers every day that say, ‘I would really love to do x, y, z, but I’m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,’” she said. “So when you’re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "description": "Stephen Moore, the former White House economist who once called for President Trump to receive a Nobel prize, has changed his tune a bit.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has described \"tariff\" as the \"most beautiful word in the English language.\" Economist Stephen Moore doesn't quite agree.\n\nMoore served as one of Trump's chief economic advisors during his first presidency, working with the administration on many tax and energy policies, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017. He famously called for Trump to receive a Nobel Peace Prize in 2018, citing, the president's record on economic policies.\n\nBut more recently, Moore has espoused a different perspective.\n\nHe recently discussed his take on Trump's economic agenda for both the past and coming years. While he praised the president's trade deals, he noted that the more recent tariff record tends to worry him.\n\nIn a CNBC appearance, Moore laid out how he feels regarding the past year's economic policies and their impact, highlighting both the positive and negative impacts posed by Trump's trade strategy.\n\n\"I like the way he's been able to negotiate better deals for the US,\" Moore noted, \"but it does worry me with tariffs because tariffs do have a negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that the tariffs have helped the US reach trade agreements with nations such as China and Japan but noted that he believes Trump may have overestimated the power of his economic policies when he promised to bring $18 trillion into the US through capital investments.\n\nMoore cited the previous year's economic forecasts that predicted 1% GDP growth. Since then, the US economy has far surpassed such estimates, posting 4.3% growth for the most recent quarter, although the data was delayed for months due to the US government shutdown.\n\n\"Part of the reason that economists were so negative on the economy was tariffs,\" Moore added, noting that he is not a fan of tariffs, despite his longstanding support for the Trump administration's policies and history of praising them.\n\nIn addition, Moore noted that he thinks the White House estimate that the US can achieve at least 5% GDP growth in the coming year isn't realistic. He added, though, that while he sees 4% as high, he thinks the US should strive to be between the 3-4% range, citing concerns about the debt curve.\n\nOften referred to as a yield curve, this economic phenomenon is impacted by tariffs, which can impact expectations regarding both growth and inflation. Moore highlighted the importance of making sure the economy is growing faster than its debt.\n\n\"If you get the economic growth rate over 3%,\" he said, \"You start turning the debt curve that we're all concerned about, the national debt and the deficits we're running. That's the main thing.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly amplified a fake Karoline Leavitt X account that once asked followers to rate the White House press secretary’s butt.\n\nTrump shares the X messages from @WHLeavitt on his Truth Social account, despite the clear(ish) indication that it is a spoof account. Whilst the handle might confuse a 79-year-old president known to be a bit of a Luddite, the display name should be a red flag to him. It is ‘Fan Karoline Leavitt,’ although ‘Fan’ is rendered in stylized fonts and emojis in a bid to obscure that word. However, in an effort to stamp out fakes, X marks such accounts with a ‘parody’ badge, too.\n\nThe messaging from the account, which has 213,000 followers, gives major clues that it is not the actual Leavitt. In March, the brains behind the bizarre operation invited followers to rate the press secretary’s rear.\n\n“What do you think of my backside? Watch the video—it’s featured in the final 3 seconds. I am with President Trump and Mr. Musk,\" the poster wrote alongside a clip of Leavitt walking up an airplane steps with the aforementioned figures. Trump did not share a screenshot of this particular poll.\n\nA new feature recently introduced by X should also help the president realize the account isn’t even based in the U.S., but in Taiwan. The profile also only became verified in November 2024, when Trump was elected, and had a documented name change in February 2025, shortly after Trump returned to the White House.\n\nHowever, it is entirely possible that Trump knows the account is a phony and shares its posts anyway, because they fit the MAGA narrative. The account, which has over 213,000 followers, regularly posts the sort of anti-immigrant sentiment and election denial that Trump segues into during speaking events.\n\n“BREAKING: Fulton County admits 315K 2020 votes lacked required poll worker signatures—a major rule violation. Republicans demand restitution for Rudy Giuliani, hit with charges & $148M fine for contesting GA election. Do you support giving his money back?\" it posted last week, based on a report about the 2020 Georgia election. Trump reshared a screenshot of the post.\n\nSimilarly, he shared a grab from a tweet the account made about Somali immigrants, demanding the deportation of all of them from Minnesota. He did this on Christmas Day.\n\nHe wasn’t drawn by a post, one of several, that indicated the poster was trying to suggest that they were indeed Leavitt. In one such ruse, they invited people to have tea with the president in the White House.\n\n“I am selecting 1,776 MAGA supporters from X for a free White House visit on July 4th, with a Trump photo op! If President Trump approved and all the expenses were covered, would you join?” it asked followers in June.\n\nSeparately, the poster invited “real human users” to a press conference headed up by Leavitt.\n\nThe White House has been asked by the Daily Beast whether Trump knows this is a spoof account.",

    "fullText": "Last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the market, despite all-time-high price of bitcoin\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Donald Trump’s favorable approach to cryptocurrency has not proven to be enough to sustain the industry’s gains, once the source of market-wide optimism and enthusiasm. The last few months of the year have seen $1tn in value wiped from the digital asset market, despite bitcoin hitting an all-time-high price of $126,000 on 6 October.\n\nThe October price peak was short-lived. Bitcoin’s price tumbled just days later after Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on China sent shockwaves across the market on 12 October. The crypto market saw $19bn liquidated in 24 hours – the largest liquidation event on record. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, saw a 40% drop in price over the next month. Eric Trump’s own crypto company endured a similar drop in its value in December.\n\nIn Donald Trump, the crypto industry was delivered the pro-bitcoin president they were promised during his campaign. Within days of taking office for the second time, he issued an executive order that repealed restrictions on cryptocurrency and introduced new favorable regulations as well as a presidential working group on digital assets.\n\n“The digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation’s international leadership,” the order read. He placed cryptocurrency front and center in American policy.\n\nAgain in March, Trump announced a new strategic cryptocurrency reserve that fueled a 62% rally in the market prices of three out of five of the coins named to the reserve. Bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency, went up 10% to $94,164 in the hours after the reserve was announced.\n\nCryptocurrency is sensitive to both narratives and confidence in global markets, said Rachael Lucas, the head of marketing and communications at BTC Markets, Australia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. It’s what is called a risk-on asset, an investment that does better when investors are feeling confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, Lucas said.\n\n“The Trump administration may be pro-crypto, but tariffs and tight monetary policy outweigh positive vibes,” said Lucas. “And it’s also just a reminder, especially for people in crypto, that macro forces really matter more than political stances.”\n\nIn November, bitcoin suffered its biggest drop in price since 2021, bringing the coin’s value to less than $81,000. While bitcoin regained some of that value in the weeks after, the digital token started December with another slump, dropping 6% after Strategy, the biggest holder of bitcoin, cut its earnings forecast because of the slide in crypto prices. Bitcoin’s price now hovers near $90,000, up from years past but significantly lower than its peak.\n\nIn the first few days of December 2025, Eric Trump’s crypto firm, American Bitcoin Corp, saw 40% of its value – roughly $1bn – wiped out.\n\nThe Trump family scion put on a bullish face and declared he would ride out the decline. “I’m holding all my @ABTC shares - I’m 100% committed to leading the industry,” Eric Trump said on X at the time.\n\nSome experts fear the industry is entering a so-called crypto winter, a prolonged period of stagnation or losses. The last time, crypto winter lasted from the end of 2021 through 2023, when the FTX mogul Sam Bankman-Fried was tried and convicted. Those years saw bitcoin slump 70% in price.\n\nDespite the optimism fueled by Trump’s win, the current market downturn shows the crypto-friendly administration wasn’t enough to usher in a return to the “retail mania” of 2021, when there was a huge upswing in individual stock trading, said Christian Catalini, the founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab.\n\n“The recent crash isn’t a change in sentiment, but a collision of three structural factors: the aftershocks of a $19bn leverage washout in October; a risk-off rotation driven by US-China tariff tensions; and, crucially, the potential unraveling of the corporate treasury trade,” Catalini said.\n\nAnother potential factor that may have shaken the crypto market is the downturn in share prices of AI stocks like Nvidia, said Lucas.\n\n“One of the reasons why bitcoin is tied to the AI cycle is because a lot of the bitcoin miners actually started leveraging their energy towards new datacenters,” she said. “Not only is crypto a technical asset, we have the miners actually tied into AI devices going up. That negative sentiment tends to sneak into crypto.”\n\nDespite concerns over a crypto winter, notable players in the crypto space Larry Fink, the CEO of investment management firm BlackRock, and Brian Armstrong, the co-founder of Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US, expressed optimism about the long-term value of the currency at a recent New York Times conference. Armstrong said “there was no chance” the price of bitcoin would go to zero and in fact 2025 would be seen as the year “when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment”. Fink, for his part, said his firm had observed “legitimate long owners investing in the currency”, including sovereign wealth funds.\n\nLucas said that this downturn in crypto prices was not inconsistent with past four-year bitcoin cycles and that she was not worried about entering a much more sustained crypto winter.\n\n“If I was looking at it from a traditional bitcoin cycle, we are actually technically in a bear market,” said Lucas. “But as you can see, even with all of these macros that are affecting the market, bitcoin has still managed to set a price above $80,000.”",

His comments came at the end of the briefing, which he held with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nDuring the briefing, Trump threw several insults at Powell, calling him \"an absolute fool.\" He also brought out a common insult, \"too late Powell,\" a reference to Powell not lowering interest rates as quickly as Trump wanted him to.\n\nTrump said he would launch a \"gross incompetence lawsuit\" against the Fed chair, repeating his old criticisms of Powell not lowering interest rates and spending too much on a renovation of the Federal Reserve building.\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Business Insider, a Fed representative said he had nothing to add.\n\nPowell, 72, has served as the Fed's chair since 2017, when Trump nominated him to the top job during his first term. He was reappointed for a second term in 2022, which is set to end in May 2026.\n\nTrump has repeatedly called for Powell's resignation since the start of his term.\n\nIn April, he said in a Truth Social post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" after the chair criticized his wide-ranging tariffs and said they could lead to high inflation and weak economic growth.\n\nIn July, sources confirmed to Business Insider that Trump had asked a group of lawmakers about firing Powell, and they gave him their approval for the decision.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to backtrack that same month, saying that he was \"highly unlikely\" to take that step and that his administration would choose someone else for the role within the next eight months.",

    "fullText": "AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson\n\nThe concerning stories about President Donald Trump’s health aren’t going away anytime soon, especially if Drudge Report has anything to say (or aggregate) about it.\n\nThe president has been occasionally seen in public with a bruised hand in recent months, but recently he has appeared with two bruised hands.\n\nOn Sunday, the president welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Mar-a-Lago, and Trump appeared to be wearing different colors of concealer on each hand.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the discoloration on Trump’s right hand is due to handshakes.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” Leavitt told The Daily Beast for an article titled, “Trump’s Bruises Spread in Blow to Leavitt’s Handshake Claim.” The press secretary did not explain the discoloration on the president’s left hand.\n\nIn another post, the U.K.’s Express highlighted the concerns some on social media aired, including that of liberal poster Aaron Rupar, who wrote, “There appears to be a hole in Trump’s left hand.”\n\nOn Monday night, Drudge Report brought the issue to the fore with links to the stories, the lines “BRUISES SPREAD” and “‘HOLE IN HAND,'” as well as an image of Trump’s hands, the size of which he defended in 2016.\n\n“I have to say this, he hit my hands,” Trump, then a first-time presidential candidate, said of an attack from opponent Marco Rubio. “Nobody has ever hit my hands. I’ve never heard of this one. Look at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they’re small, something else must be small.\n\nTrump added, “I guarantee you there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”\n\nDuring recent public appearances, the president has been seen covering his right hand with his left hand and sometimes a bandage.\n\nThe post ‘Bruises Spread’: Drudge Report Highlights Alarming Stories on Trump’s ‘Hole in Hand’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images (L)/Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images (R)\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) went scorched earth on President Donald Trump in a New York Times profile on Monday, trashing the president’s claim to a Christian faith and singling out her stand on the Epstein files as what sent him over the edge.\n\nGreene, who spent years as a staunch Trump loyalist, recounted her break with the president to Times reporter Robert Draper, claiming that she was “naïve” for having been part of what she called a “toxic” political culture she said she found to be at odds with her Christian faith.\n\nHaving now found herself branded a “traitor” by the president and his most awkward Republican critic, Greene explained that her break with Trump sharpened after the September killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which she recalled as a pivotal moment.\n\nWatching Kirk’s memorial service, Greene said she was struck by the contrast between the forgiveness of Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, and Trump’s onstage remarks that, unlike Kirk, he chooses to “hate” his “opponent.”\n\n“It just shows where his heart is,” she later texted Draper, adding: “It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”\n\nGreene told the Times the episode forced a reckoning with the brawler persona she said Trump had helped normalize and that she had participated in.\n\n“Our side has been trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong,” she said. “You just keep pummeling your enemies, no matter what. And as a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that. I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.”\n\n“After Charlie died,” Greene told Draper on another occasion. “I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”\n\nFrom Trump’s perspective, Greene insisted, the real rupture was her stand on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n“It was Epstein. Epstein was everything,” she told the Times.\n\nGreene pushed to force the release of investigative material, arguing it symbolised elite impunity: “Rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims.”\n\nThe break gave way to wider criticism of what she believed was the divergence of Trump and congressional Republicans from America First policy making, which irked fellow Republican lawmakers and resulted in the president branding her a “traitor.”\n\n“Am I going to get murdered, or one of my kids, because he’s calling me a traitor?” she said she asked herself after a pipe bomb threat and an anonymous email targeting her son.\n\nSoon after she announced she would be retiring from Congress, yet throughout she insisted that she did not change — MAGA did.\n\n“Everyone’s like, ‘She’s changed,’” Greene said to Draper. “I haven’t changed my views. But I’ve matured. I’ve developed depth.”\n\nShe added: “I’ve learned Washington, and I’ve come to understand the brokenness of the place. If none of us is learning lessons here and we can’t evolve and mature with our lessons, then what kind of people are we?”\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Goes Scorched Earth on Trump in Splashy NYT Feature — Claims ‘He Does Not Have Any Faith’ and Her Epstein Stand Was Last Straw first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "The talk of a new Middle East is belied by Israel’s attacks on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\n\nNo foreign leader has easier access to President Donald Trump than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose scheduled meeting today at Mar-a-Lago will be the fifth time he’s hobnobbed with the US president in the past 10 months. In February, Netanyahu was the first overseas dignitary to visit the White House in Trump’s second term, and now the year ends with another meeting. Few foreign leaders have buttered up Trump with the aplomb of Netanyahu, who describes Trump as Israel’s “greatest friend.”\n\nIn Trump’s first four years in office, these enthusiastic words were more than earned. As Al Jazeera noted, “During his first term, Trump pushed US policy further in favour of Israel’s right-wing government. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied Golan Heights and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).”\n\nThe situation in Trump’s second term is more complicated. Small but significant disagreements have opened up between Israel and the United States. Trump’s push for a foreign policy more focused on the Western Hemisphere—which includes bombing putative drug boats and threatening regime change in Venezuela—depends on shifting military resources away from Europe and the Middle East. In the National Security Strategy release in November, the Trump administration argued that the Middle East is “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship and investment.” Ironically, Trump’s pursuit of a pivot away from the Middle East is a continuation of unsuccessful efforts for a lighter US footprint in the region pursued by his predecessors Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nTrump’s peace plans for the region have a pie-in-the-sky feel. They would entail the United States offshoring its military presence while pushing for a closer integration of its Arab allies with Israel and the emergence of a new government in Gaza. As Roger Cohen, Paris bureau chief for The New York Times, dryly noted, “Such optimism, based in large part on the Gaza peace agreement signed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, looks overblown, much like President Trump’s claim that day that it took 3,000 years to reach a breakthrough of this kind.”\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to Trump’s vision of a new Middle East is that Israel is having none of it. While Trump touts his ceasefire, Israel has continued to bomb Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. In his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to push for a renewed bombing campaign against Iran as well.\n\nNetanyahu has no interest in the Middle East becoming a place of “partnership, friendship and investment.” Rather, the Israeli leader’s strategy is clearly one of maintaining regional hegemony by promoting chaos. This is the tried-and-true imperialist method of divide-and-conquer.\n\nThe conflicting goals of the United States and Israel can be most clearly seen in Syria. Cohen argues that there is ground for hope in the end of the civil war in Syria, with a unified nation now being rebuilt under the leadership of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadi who has pursued a policy of reconciliation. As Cohen noted:\n\nRemarkable progress has, however, also been made in a year. Mr. al-Sharaa has garnered support from the United States, Russia and China. He has secured the lifting of economic sanctions. He has remained steady in the face of repeated military provocations from Israel, and has begun to lay the basis of state institutions. He has been embraced by Mr. Trump and was ushered to the White House last month.\n\nUnfortunately, while Israel and its Arab allies are backing Syrian reconstruction, Netanyahu’s government is seeking security by keeping Syria divided. On December 23, a Washington Post report documented that Israel had been arming Druze militiamen in Syria who want a separate state. According to the report, “Some Israeli and American analysts argue that Israel’s aggressive use of military force in Syria and its clandestine efforts to promote Druze separatism were counterproductive and undercut relations at a time when Sharaa appeared eager to reach a diplomatic détente.”\n\nDana Stroul, a former senior Pentagon official, told the Washington Post:\n\n“There has been growing frustration in Washington that Israeli actions were setting back something most of Washington and everyone in the Middle East would actually like to see succeed: a stabilized, unified Syria. The basic argument to Israel is, look, you actually have leaders in Damascus who are willing to say the word ‘Israel’ and talk about a potential future with normalized relations, yet you just keep bombing or looking for a surrogate to work through.”\n\nTrump styles himself as an American First nationalist. There is every reason to oppose Israel’s belligerent foreign policy in terms of American national interest as well as on the grounds of international peace. It’s hard to find any rational benefit for the United States in Syria sinking back into chaos or in Iran being bombed. Further, criticism of Israel’s belligerence is rising not just among liberals but also on the MAGA right, with voices such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson warning of the dangers of more Middle Eastern wars.\n\nDespite this shifting political landscape, there’s no reason to put any faith in Trump standing up to Netanyahu. Everything in Trump’s record indicates his handling of foreign policy is fundamentally feckless and that he’s easily swayed by hawkish voices who remain powerful inside the Republican Party. While there are areas of disagreements between Netanyahu and Trump, the more crucial difference is between how invested each is in their policy preferences. Netanyahu is heavily invested in his vision of Israel as a hegemonic power in the Middle East that is willing to spread chaos to fend off any possible foe. Trump, by contrast, has no deep policy commitments, which makes him vulnerable to the suasion of Netanyahu and the pro-Israel lobby. Trump’s peace plans are a flimsy house of cards, which Netanyahu will easily topple.\n\nIn this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year.\n\nAnother world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!",

    "fullText": "“We’ve dropped (the price of) the infertility drugs to make lots of Trump babies, I’m hoping by the midterms.” That bizarre remark was made recently by Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nAfter four years of the first Trump administration and nearly one year into the second, many of us have become desensitized to this kind of commentary – but not Black women. We know the quiet part spoken out loud when we hear it.\n\nDr. Oz’s remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean. This administration will stop at nothing to ensure the political dominance of White people in this country.\n\n“Trump babies” born ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 won’t vote until 2044, but after decades of listening to phrases like “welfare queens,” we know a dog whistle when we hear one. To understand this moment, it helps to look across generations.\n\nMore than 60 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. One cannot underestimate the impact of that generation’s monumental moment on what’s happening today.\n\nThis seminal 1965 pair of laws “democratized the idea of who could be an American” and who could vote, as recently reported by The New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb.\n\nOpinion: Americans are shifting away from wanting kids. I'm worried for my generation.\n\nTwenty years from now, the White population in America will fall below 50%. Non-White births already exceed those of White Americans, and non-White children under age 15 already outnumber White children.\n\nThat reality should usher in a more inclusive democracy. Instead, White supremacists see it as an existential threat.\n\nThe MAGA movement intends to preserve power at all costs. Its four-part plan for stopping this demographic tsunami includes voter suppression, undermining reproductive justice, drastically reducing the number of non-White children who grow up to be voters through targeted deportations and incentivizing U.S. births among “traditional families.”\n\nFirst is the strategic disenfranchisement of Black and Latino voters by gutting the Voting Rights Act, culling us from voter lists and gerrymandering the elimination of congressional seats representing Black and Brown constituencies.\n\nSecond is pricing out low-income parents from having the economic and reproductive autonomy to choose their family sizes. The cost to raise a U.S. child born in 2015 to age 18 is estimated to be $320,000, and with families of color facing disproportionate levels of poverty, slashing safety net programs will only make it harder for people in our communities to have children.\n\nIn fact, recent state polling from In Our Own Voice found that financial insecurity is a top concern among Black adults as to why they are not growing their families. This will only be exacerbated as federal budget cuts and inflation make basic necessities like childcare, shelter and nutrition increasingly out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the poor quality of care in our health system, underscored by the recent experiences of two Black women, Karrie Jones in Texas and Mercedes Wells in Indiana, both of whom were dismissed while in active labor, shows how dangerous and unequal the path to parenthood has become.\n\nSlashing Medicaid for millions will cripple critical care for more than a quarter of Black and Latina women, more than half of Black girls and, in a shift too significant to ignore, two-thirds of Black births.\n\nThird, we are witnessing our government’s brutal kidnappings and deportations of Black and Brown immigrants of reproductive age and their children. Along with attacking birthright citizenship, limiting international student visas and admitting only White Afrikaners as refugees, these nativist policies set the stage for shrinking pathways for America’s non-White population.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

While the administration’s early ideas – a $1,000 “baby bonus” and medals for mothers of six – may sound harmless, they point to the concerning rise of America’s pronatalism movement.\n\nWith unmistakable echoes of eugenics, its White, religious, conservative champions are pushing for more births among married, heterosexual couples and for children engineered for high intelligence and other so-called desirable traits.\n\nIn this context, the push for a new generation of “Trump babies” fits squarely within a broader strategy to dictate who gets to be born, who gets to stay and who ultimately gets to participate in American democracy.\n\nOpinion: Liberals aren't having kids, conservatives are. That matters.\n\nIt’s long past time for the opposition to stop reacting to executive orders, shutdowns and political theater and start listening to Black women. The “Trump babies” remark and ideology foreshadow a weakened and deeply unequal democracy.\n\nSo let’s call this what it is: a generational war by those clinging to power to “Make America Great Again” by preserving White dominance of American political, economic and cultural life; dramatically reducing Black and Latinobirths andsuffrage;and neutralizing a demographic tipping point that will permanently end White majority in the United States.\n\nBecause this is a generational strategy, it demands a generational response – one rooted in truth, organized power and an unwavering commitment to the dignity, agency and futures of Black, Brown and immigrant communities.\n\nRegina Davis Moss, a public health expert and author with a specialty in Black maternal health, is president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY columnists and other writers on the Opinion front page, on X, formerly Twitter, @usatodayopinion and in our Opinion newsletter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Trump babies' reveal GOP's long game: Voter suppression | Opinion",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration’s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.\n\nAt recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.\n\nExperts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.\n\nBut as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.\n\nTalks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.\n\nSouth Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.\n\nStill, it's unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nPower transition sparks climate goals\n\nSouth Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.\n\n“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nSouth Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.\n\n“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSouth Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal\n\nThe South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.\n\nAs part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.\n\nThe agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.\n\nLNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.\n\nSouth Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.\n\n“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,\" Lee said.\n\nRenewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.\n\nJapan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.\n\nClean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.\n\nNuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.\n\n“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.\n\nIn early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.\n\nSouth Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.\n\nMany global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.\n\n“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nCoal trade braces for South Korea cuts\n\nAt last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.\n\nThat's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”\n\nSouth Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.\n\nThe pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”\n\n“The writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.
