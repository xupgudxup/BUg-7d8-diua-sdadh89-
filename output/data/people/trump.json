    "title": "What to expect from January's Fed meeting as Powell faces looming DOJ probe",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely hold rates steady at its January meeting, even as Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure from Trump amid the DOJ probe.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve will make its first rate decision of the year on Wednesday — and all eyes are on Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe central bank's leaders have a near-total chance of holding rates steady this week, according to market-based projections from CME FedWatch. After three cuts in 2025, the Fed has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. In the long run, these rate decisions will affect the job market, consumer prices, and corporate America.\n\nBut there's a shadow over January's Fed meeting: The Department of Justice recently launched a probe into Powell's handling of renovations to the central bank's buildings. The Trump administration alleges that the chair gave false testimony at a June Congressional appearance, though Powell said the move should \"be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\" on the Fed.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" he said in a video statement released January 11.\n\nFed decisions impact mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, inflation, and labor market churn over time. A slow but not catastrophically weak job market, combined with higher-than-ideal but relatively tame inflation, will probably mean a pause in rate cuts for now.\n\n\"There's little chance the Fed will vote to cut rates this week, as the data in-hand doesn't justify it,\" said NerdWallet's senior economist Elizabeth Renter, adding, \"The Fed's monetary policy job is a balancing act and their decision to keep rates as-is indicates the risks to either side of their dual mandate are relatively equal.\"\n\nThe central bank's dual mandate — to keep prices stable and the job market strong — has been tricky to balance lately. The US added fewer jobs than expected in December, the unemployment rate is hovering above 4%, and the inflation rate remained at 2.7%. If Fed leaders opt to hold rates steady rather than cut, it will be good news for inflation, at the risk of slowing down an already-sluggish jobs landscape.\n\nFor consumers, a hold means that interest rates for homes, cars, and credit cards would largely remain unchanged. The Fed also hopes to push inflation closer to its 2% goal. For job seekers, however, still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes.\n\nThe Fed has made more headlines than usual this month. Powell announced grand jury subpoenas from the Trump administration through a video message posted online. And Governor Lisa Cook's case has reached the Supreme Court, following accusations of mortgage fraud from Trump.\n\nThe Powell probe has raised alarm about Fed independence with politicians, economists, and business leaders. North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis and other congressional leaders said they will now oppose all nominees to the Fed chair role from the Trump administration.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to choose a successor as soon as this week. Frontrunners include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.\n\nThe president has been vocal in his desire for lower interest rates and hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on policy decisions.\n\n\"The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed,\" Renter said.",

    "description": "It's been all Trump, all the time in the market so far this year. That could be about to change.",
    "fullText": "No matter how you slice it, it's been TrumpWorld in the stock market so far in 2026.\n\nSeemingly every day, the president is doing something new to stir up volatility in various asset classes and stock-market sectors. We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus.\n\nThat's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into.\n\nHere are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each.\n\nThis gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no \"will-they / won't-they\" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here.\n\nWhat traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas,\n\nMarket significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka \"selling America.\") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?)\n\nIf Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market.\n\nThis week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday.\n\nMarket significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership.\n\nTesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown.",

    "fullText": "Bessent said the Treasury is canceling its contracts with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nAn employee at the firm pleaded guilty to leaking Trump and Musk's tax returns.\n\nThe company's stock dropped more than 11% after the announcement.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Treasury Department cut contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, whose employee leaked President Donald Trump's tax returns years ago. By early afternoon, the move sent the consulting firm's stock down more than 11%.\n\nThe department has 31 different contracts with the firm, worth $4.8 million in yearly spending and $21 million in obligations, it said in a press release. The press release noted that Charles Edward Littlejohn, a former employee at the consulting firm, leaked the tax returns of thousands of taxpayers. The leak affected roughly 406,000 people, according to the IRS.\n\n\"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,\" Bessent said in the release.\n\nA company spokesperson said in a statement that it has \"consistently condemned in the strongest possible terms\" Littlejohn's actions, and has \"zero tolerance\" for breaking the law.\n\n\"When Littlejohn's criminal conduct occurred over 5 years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,\" the statement said. It added that the company supported the government's investigation, and that they \"look forward to discussing this matter with Treasury.\"\n\nLittlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax return information and was sentenced to five years in prison last year, according to the New York Times. He shared the returns of Trump and other wealthy Americans, including Elon Musk, with the outlet and ProPublica.",

Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.\n\nCasey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.\n\nByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.\n\nWith more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nEach of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.\n\nThe US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares hit a new record on Tuesday as investors hoped for the best from a barrage of U.S. large-cap earnings, though uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves on South Korea boosted gold and silver.\n\nAccusing South Korea’s legislature of \"not living up\" to its trade deal with Washington, Trump late on Monday said he would increase tariffs on imports from Asia’s fourth-largest economy into the U.S. to 25%.\n\nStocks appeared to take the news in stride, with Nasdaq futures up 0.5%, as investors geared up for a slew of earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Tesla starting on Wednesday.\n\nEven South Korea’s KOSPI quickly reversed earlier losses to surge by more than 2%, hitting a new peak. European stocks are braced for a higher open, with EURO STOXX 50 futures up 0.3%.\n\n\"Enthusiasm over the most eventful earnings week of the season has investors raising exposure to tech shares ahead of four of the Magnificent Seven reporting results,\" said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nOn Trump’s higher tariffs on South Korea, Torres believed a visit from South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan to Washington as soon as this Friday could \"ease tensions and buy its government some additional time to improve relations.\"\n\nStill, the uncertainty lifted safe-haven gold by 1% to $5,065 an ounce, just shy of an all-time high of $5,110, while silver gained 4% to $108 an ounce, not far from a record of $117.70 that was set on Monday.\n\n\"The frenetic nature of uncertainty, coupled with a weaker dollar, have been the primary contributors to this latest leg higher (for gold),\" said Christopher Louney, a commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nLouney said history suggested the current gold rally could run into early September or mid-December this year, adding that prices could go as high as $7,100 per ounce at the end of the year based on its 2025 performance.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to hit a new record high. The Nikkei gained 0.7%, even with the recent sharp rebound in the yen clouding the outlook for Japan’s vast export sector.\n\nChinese blue chips rose 0.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is coming under fire again in the first few weeks of 2026 as a growing range of factors - including Washington’s desire for a weaker currency and Trump’s erratic policymaking - prompts a rethink of investors’ optimistic assumptions for a period of greenback stability.\n\nIts latest slump to more than four-month lows was driven by sharp gains in the Japanese yen starting on Friday when chatter about rate checks by the New York Fed fuelled the risk of a joint U.S.-Japan intervention to halt the yen’s slide.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.2% to 154.55 yen on Tuesday, having lost a staggering 2.6% over the past two sessions, which was well below the 160 yen level that is viewed as a line in the sand for Japanese authorities.\n\nAgainst six major currencies, the greenback was flat at 97.12, near a 4-1/2 month low of 96.8.\n\nIn the Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 4.2292% after falling for four straight sessions away from a recent peak of 4.313%.\n\nWorries about another U.S. government shutdown are also brewing in the background, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over funding for Trump’s Department of Homeland Security after the fatal shooting of a second U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\n\nOil prices fell on Tuesday as investors kept an eye on a resumption in supply from Kazakhstan. Brent crude futures dropped 0.7% to $65.13 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6% to $60.25.",

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 26, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others. However, the Fed is also expected to release its rate decision tomorrow, adding to the busy state of affairs this week.\n\nThrough midday, things have taken a small turn. The Russell 2000 (-0.21%), once leading the pack is now the sole decliner among major indexes. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq (+0.71%) has pulled ahead.\n\nIn their fourth straight winning session, 56.1% (3,103) U.S. issues are now seen declining, but the 41.5% (2,293) lifting the market are putting up quite the fight.\n\nThat said, here are today's midday movers, our daily list of the top and bottom 20 stocks with at least a $2 billion market cap. Here, we aim to capture the biggest stories on markets\n\nUSA Rare Earth (+14.86%) is fetching a bid today after the U.S. government confirmed it would take a 10% stake in the business, making it today's best-performer.\n\nIt's joined by a handful of software companies; DigitalOcean (+12.27%), Pattern Group (+12.06%), Cloudflare (+10.74%), and Zoom Communications (+9.87%) are also putting up a strong performance today after a weak week for software stocks.",

    "description": "A major shakeup is underway after Border Czar Tom Homan was ordered by Donald Trump to take over the ICE operation in Minnesota, sidelining Kristi Noem.",
    "fullText": "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino - dubbed 'little Napoleon' - has been ordered to leave Minneapolis in a major shakeup initiated by Tom Homan.\n\nDonald Trump sidelined Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, dispatching Border Czar Homan, an ICE veteran, to take charge of the deteriorating crisis in Minnesota after a protester was shot dead on Saturday.\n\nHoman is expected to hold a press conference later today where Bovino's departure, along with that of hundreds of his agents, will be announced.\n\nThe decision is aimed at de-escalating the violence between federal agents and rioters which exploded on Saturday after the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse.\n\nBovino, the controversial face of Trump's crackdown and a close ally of Noem, sparked fury in the White House when he claimed Pretti intended to 'massacre' federal agents.\n\nTrump spent hours on Sunday and Monday watching cable news coverage and was unsettled by how the administration was being portrayed, one official told CNN.\n\nNoem branded the ICU nurse a 'domestic terrorist' and claimed he brandished a firearm, sparking further frustration among administration officials.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced Trump from Noem's language on Monday, arguing that it was not a position that the President had taken.\n\nBorder Patrol chief Gregory Bovino observes a protest in Minneapolis on January 15\n\nFederal agents point weapons at protesters near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nBorder Czar Tom Homan visits 'Varney & Co.' at Fox Business Network on January 13\n\nBovino is a loyalist to Noem and her rumored lover Corey Lewandowski, and both have quietly pushed him as a potential replacement for current Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, a longtime ally of Homan.\n\nNoem has sought to sideline Scott by having Bovino report directly to her, an unprecedented move within the agency.\n\nBovino's removal from Minneapolis underscores Noem's fading standing with the White House as Trump dispatches Homan and his closest allies to seize control of the operation on the ground.\n\nA Border Patrol veteran of 30 years, Bovino was selected last year from his role as chief patrol agent of the agency's El Centro sector in Southern California to lead highly publicized immigration crackdowns across the country.\n\nHis aggressive tactics, often highly choreographed public displays, sparked backlash from local officials.\n\nBovino often stood out as the only agent not wearing a face covering when Border Patrol descended on Home Depots and gas stations.\n\nHe has gone viral on social media as he is frequently spotted on the frontlines sporting a severe buzzcut and trench coat, which German media has likened to a 'Nazi aesthetic'.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said on X: 'Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process.'\n\nA protester is pepper sprayed at close range while being detained near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference at the headquarters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to discuss a major winter storm affecting much of the country as well as the shooting death of a Minneapolis man by federal agents in Minnesota, in Washington, DC, on January 24\n\nBovino hit back, claiming he had the coat for more than 25 years and it was official Border Patrol merchandise.\n\nJenn Budd, an author and expert on Border Patrol, described Bovino as 'the Liberace' of the agency.\n\n'He was just a little Napoleon who wants you to think that he is the most moral and capable guy in the world, and everything around you is dangerous but he's the one who's going to save you,' Budd told The Times. 'It's all a show for him.'\n\nHe once invited journalists to watch him swim across a canal in Southern California's Imperial Valley in a bid to deter migrants considering the crossing.\n\nAfter Trump was re-elected Bovino used similar public relations expertise to catch the president's eye.\n\nHe sent dozens of agents to arrest migrants at gas stations along the highway ahead of Trump's inauguration.\n\nAsked why Bovino was chosen to lead the force, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told reporters bluntly: 'Because he's a badass.'\n\nBut while Bovino's strongman image earned him Trump's respect, his self-proclaimed 'turn and  burn' enforcement strategies have sparked concern.\n\nA federal judge accused Bovino in November of being 'evasive' and at times 'outright lying' in sworn testimony about an immigration crackdown in Chicago, finding his account 'simply not credible.'\n\nJudge Sara Ellis wrote that Bovino even admitted he lied about being hit with a rock before ordering tear gas used, and noted that video evidence flatly contradicted his claim that he never tackled a protester.",

    "description": "Geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariff threats, and inflation fears have helped propel gold to $5,000 for the first time ever on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Gold is surging yet again, with the metal touching $5,000 an ounce on Monday for the first time ever.\n\nBehind the latest rally is the familiar cocktail of tailwinds that are bullish for gold, but less so for other parts of the market and the economy. The \"sell America\" trade is still getting a boost, inflationary concerns linger, and fears about geopolitical crises continue to percolate.\n\nHere are the latest updates on what's driving gold's parabolic rally to all-time highs.\n\nGold jumped more than 2% on Monday as trade tensions roil markets once again after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes any sort of trade agreement with China.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nGold tends to play a \"flight-to-safety\" role in markets. When investors get scared about the economic consequences of Trump upending trade with key allies, they've often flocked to the metal for shelter.\n\nThe threatening rhetoric against allies like Canada and last week's sabre-rattling from Trump about taking over Greenland sparked a return of the \"Sell America\" trade, which has boosted gold over the last year.\n\nAs gold spiked to fresh highs on Monday, the dollar index fell almost 1% against major rivals to about $96.96.\n\nOccupying a similar place in investors' minds to \"Sell America\" is the debasement trade, which continues to boost metals like gold as markets fret about other safe havens such as Treasurys.\n\nGold bulls say that a weakening of the US dollar and other fiat currencies as governments pursue aggressive fiscal policies will boost more stable stores of value.\n\nTrump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and Jerome Powell has been the latest update that has investors fretting over currency debasement and flocking to gold. The thinking is that political meddling with monetary policy and a dovish new Fed chair could lead to lower interest rates and spur a new period of inflation down the road. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices among investors.\n\nThe debasement trade was a dominant theme in markets in 2025, and analysts have eyed it as a driver of bullish forecasts for 2026.\n\nAccording to Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX advisors, arguably the biggest driver in gold's outperformance over the last few years has been global central bank buying.\n\n\"After COVID, when America printed all this money, central banks — and it was led by China — quite literally doubled their annual purchases of gold, and they were selling Treasurys to do so,\" McMillan told Business Insider.\n\nCentral banks have also been trying to diversify their holdings away from US dollars, a trend that accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That prompted the US to freeze Russia's dollar reserves, drawing criticism over \"weaponization\" of the dollar and sparking more gold buying from countries like China.\n\nHeightened uncertainty is the heart of gold's bull case for many investors, and the geopolitical outlook looks shakier than it has in a long time.\n\nFrom Trump's moves in Venezuela, the ongoing war in Ukraine, turmoil in Iran, and a strained NATO alliance, gold bugs have a lot to worry about these days. As current conflicts stretch into 2026, analysts say they expect gold's safe-haven status to keep surging.\n\nFinally, the fear of missing out on a meme-like rally might be behind some of the moves. Gold is up 87% since the start of 2025, and has spiked 25% since October.\n\nThe gains are too good for some to watch from the sidelines.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, retail traders have been pouring money into gold recently, egged on by talk of the \"Sell America\" trade and an endless parade of bulls who say precious metals will keep rising.\n\nSilver is up even more than gold in the last year, and market pros told Business Insider that they worry the flight to safety itself has become a major investment bubble that could end badly for investors chasing the rally.",

    "fullText": "Before Melania Trump became a fashion model and first lady of the United States, she was Melanija Knavs, the Slovenian daughter of a car salesman and a textile factory worker.\n\nAs the first naturalized US citizen to serve as first lady and the second foreign-born first lady in US history, Trump's hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has become a tourist destination attracting visitors to see where she spent her early years.\n\nHere are some Sevnica landmarks from Trump's childhood.\n\nTrump was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, on April 26, 1970.\n\nShe spent her childhood in Sevnica, a small town 30 miles away.\n\nIt has a population of 17,672, according to data collected by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia in 2023.\n\nSlovenia became independent in 1991.\n\nSevnica produces over 150 kinds of salami, a feat celebrated at its annual Salamiada festival.\n\nSevnica's tourism doubled in the year before Donald Trump's first term as interest in Melania Trump grew, a tour guide told Reuters in January 2017.\n\nThe small town capitalized on its claim to fame as the former FLOTUS' hometown, offering tours, foods, and souvenirs named after her.\n\nFor 2017 as a whole, the number of foreigners visiting Slovenia jumped 17% when compared to the previous year, with a total of 3.4 million visitors, Reuters reported in January 2018.\n\nThe number of visitors has risen in the years since, with just under 7 million visitors in 2025, The Slovenian Times reported.\n\nHer father, Viktor Knavs, worked as a car salesman. Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

By early afternoon, the move sent the consulting firm's stock down more than 11%.\n\nThe department has 31 different contracts with the firm, worth $4.8 million in yearly spending and $21 million in obligations, it said in a press release. The press release noted that Charles Edward Littlejohn, a former employee at the consulting firm, leaked the tax returns of thousands of taxpayers. The leak affected roughly 406,000 people, according to the IRS.\n\n\"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,\" Bessent said in the release.\n\nA company spokesperson said in a statement that it has \"consistently condemned in the strongest possible terms\" Littlejohn's actions, and has \"zero tolerance\" for breaking the law.\n\n\"When Littlejohn's criminal conduct occurred over 5 years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,\" the statement said. It added that the company supported the government's investigation, and that they \"look forward to discussing this matter with Treasury.\"\n\nLittlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax return information and was sentenced to five years in prison last year, according to the New York Times.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a fierce national debate and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.\n\nAfter remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and \"turn over\" people who were in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network.\n\nTrump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics.\n\nTrump also told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Sunday that his administration was “reviewing everything,” but he refused to say whether the officer who shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti acted appropriately.\n\n“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not answer questions about whether Trump watched the videos of the shooting in Minnesota, which seemed to contradict the account of what happened by members of his administration, or whether he planned to speak to Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who had appealed to the president to help bring calm to the city.\n\nInstead, Trump on Sunday night said he would call on Congress to pass legislation banning so-called sanctuary cities. His administration has sought to apply the label to communities based on their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, among other factors.\n\nHis push for action by lawmakers comes even as outrage over the shooting has raised the possibility of a partial government shutdown in a week because of a standoff over additional funding for immigration enforcement.\n\nTrump's initial reaction to the shooting of Pretti came hours after it took place on Saturday. In a post on his Truth Social network, he questioned why Pretti had a firearm and accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of inciting \"Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”\n\nBut throughout the weekend, Trump, who rarely lets a major moment go without comment, did not make any public appearances or express any dismay over Pretti's death.\n\nInstead, he posted online complaining about Canada and efforts to stop him from building an expansive ballroom at the White House, calling a lawsuit to block its construction “devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nHe also posted messages praising U.K. troops after his comments about them earlier in the week were widely interpreted as a grave insult and praising guests appearing on Fox News Channel.\n\nWhen he finally weighed in again Sunday night as criticism grew, Trump was unbowed.\n\nHe called on Walz and Frey, also a Democrat, to turn over for deportation anyone in the country illegally who was held in state prisons or local jails, along with anyone who has a warrant out for their arrest or a criminal history.\n\nIn his comments to The Wall Street Journal, Trump criticized Pretti for carrying a gun.\n\n“I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” Trump said. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n\nHe said that immigration enforcement officers will leave Minneapolis “at some point” but did not offer a time frame.\n\nMembers of his administration, meanwhile, were quick to say the shooting, the second killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by immigration officers in recent weeks, was a case of an armed man provoking violence.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on social media, without offering any evidence, that Pretti was “an assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.”\n\nVice President JD Vance shared Miller's post. He issued other ones blaming local officials and describing what was happening in Minneapolis as “engineered chaos” that was “the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities.”",

    "fullText": "A Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota dropped his campaign as a direct response to the way the Trump administration has carried out its immigration enforcement.\n\nOn Monday morning, Republican candidate Chris Madel posted a 10-minute video on X/Twitter announcing his decision. He explained that although he was initially supportive of the Trump administration’s mission to remove violent criminals from communities in the state, the recent actions of ICE have displayed “retribution” on U.S. citizens instead.\n\nI cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so. I support the originally stated goals of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Metro Surge, in locating and deporting the worst of the worst from our state. And I’ve seen many examples of ICE arresting non-U.S. citizens in Minnesota convicted of serious crimes, including murder, rape, and child sexual assault. No reasonable person should want these people here, and I am glad that they are gone.\n\nBut Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats. United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a border patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and it’s wrong. Weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents is unconstitutional, regardless of who is in power.\n\nI am ending my campaign for Minnesota Governor. I describe why in the below video. Please watch until the end.

    "description": "President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into Minneapolis and other cities, leading to a series of violent clashes.\n\nFootage from bystanders of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizen protesters, including Saturday’s incident that ​left an ICU nurse dead, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.\n\nCameras worn by ‌officers long have been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give ICE officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend ‌of cameras for law enforcement.\n\nOfficials last year also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.\n\nDarius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under President Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities.”\n\n“Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said.\n\nAt least three of ⁠the eight or more Border Patrol agents at the scene of Saturday's ‌shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.\n\nEFFORTS TO SLASH ICE BODY-CAM FUNDING\n\nWhen ICE or Border Patrol have engaged in acts of violence - including the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good ‍and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis - top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations.\n\nTrump has started ramping up immigration enforcement this year after Republicans in Congress passed a bill last year that provides $170 billion for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and Border Patrol operate.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in social ​media posts hours after he was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ‌unless it reins in immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection - Border Patrol’s parent agency - had 13,400 cameras for some 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.\n\nICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.\n\nThe proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.\n\nDHS says there are some 22,000 ICE officers but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.\n\nA homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last week rejected that proposal, instead providing $20 million for ICE and Border Patrol cameras.\n\nStill, the bill - ⁠which now faces a challenging route to passage in the U.S. Senate - did not require either agency to use the devices.\n\nScott ​Shuchart, a top ICE official under Biden, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations ​outside their normal operating area, an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCOMPLAINTS UNANSWERED AS OVERSIGHT STAFF CUT\n\nThe Trump administration placed some 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal ‍agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move ⁠that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.\n\nA lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do, and left no way to address abuses.\n\nIn May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.\n\nAs of ⁠December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared to more than a hundred in March.\n\nIn 2023, OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 ‌complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.",

    "description": "The New York Democrat broke down what the homeland security secretary really means and warned of the “uncorking of chaos” by the Trump administration.",
    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump stunned members of his inner circle by calmly predicting when his own body would be lying in state, according to a new report.\n\nThe 79-year-old president reportedly made the comment at Mar-a-Lago as television screens showed Jimmy Carter’s casket at the U.S. Capitol, telling the room: “You know, within ten years that will be me.”\n\nThe remark, attributed to a person familiar with his comments, appears in a sprawling New York Magazine profile, “The Superhuman President,” about the president’s health and psyche.\n\nThe episode adds a morbid twist to how Trump and his team now talk about 2028.\n\nOne senior White House official told New York Magazine that “the specter of death sometimes manifests in the 2028 conversation,” describing aides gaming out whether the president will be willing—or able—to mount yet another run when he will be in his early 80s.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has leaned into the idea that clinging to the presidency is what keeps him alive.\n\nTrump is already the oldest person ever to be elected president.\n\nInstead of talking about slowing down, he has repeatedly teased the prospect of running again, boasting that he could seek a third term and even what would amount to a fourth term, when he is 86, even as legal experts point out the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nTrump’s brags clash with mounting unease about his health, which the Daily Beast has led the way in reporting.\n\nIn the New York Magazine piece, aides fret about his bruised hands, frequent naps in public, and a mysterious MRI trip to Walter Reed that the White House struggled to explain.\n\nFormer White House lawyer Ty Cobb warned this month that Trump’s cognitive decline is “palpable,” while prominent physician Dr. Bruce Davison told the Beast’s podcast that the president’s daily 325 mg aspirin regimen is the kind of dose usually reserved for stroke patients.\n\nInside Trump’s circle, the result is a strange dual reality, of a president who talks about death, legacy, and what he will leave behind—from a $400 million East Wing ballroom to the “Arc de Trump” he wants erected across from the Lincoln Memorial—while still casting himself as a superhuman figure who can outwork younger rivals and defy time.\n\nAs one senior official told New York Magazine, succession talk is as much about letting Trump live forever through his chosen heirs as it is about acknowledging that he will not.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "USA Rare Earth shares spiked on Monday amid the Trump administration's latest push to reduce US dependence on foreign sources of critical materials.",
    "fullText": "The move: USA Rare Earth stock jumped 20% on Monday, extending its rally from the previous Friday's close. The rare earth mining and manufacturing company has already had a strong start to 2026, with year-to-date gains of 108%.\n\nWhy: On Monday, USA Rare Earth announced that it had entered into a non-binding letter of intent with the US Department of Commerce, as part of a collaboration with the US Department of Energy to award the government agency an equity stake.\n\nUnder the agreement, the company will receive a $1.3 billion loan from the Commerce Department, as well as $277 million in federal funding. In return, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million common shares and 17.6 million warrants to the department.\n\nThe agreement says that by 2030, the rare earth miner will be extracting 40,000 metric tons of critical mineral feedstock from its Round Top deposit on a daily basis. Located in Hudspeth County, West Texas, the mine is expected to begin production in 2028.\n\nWhat it means: It's the latest development in the Trump administration's push to strengthen America's domestic supply chain of critical materials and become less dependent on foreign producers. The administration has taken stakes in firms across a handful of industries, with Trump pushing for more government involvement in industries he deems crucial to US security.\n\nAs the AI boom greatly increases the need for critical minerals and rare earth elements, the White House has taken stakes in other US-based mining companies, including MP Materials, Critical Metals, and Lithium Americas. All three mining stocks also rose on the news on Monday.\n\nThis tactic of taking stakes in private firms has sparked significant momentum for mining stocks, turning the industry into one of the hottest trades of 2025. This trend looks poised to continue into 2026 as the White House adds another domestic miner to its portfolio.\n\n\"With this unprecedented show of public and private support for our Company, we are positioned to accelerate the build-out of important domestic capabilities that are essential to U.S. national security, global economic competitiveness, and critical technologies of the future,\" stated Barbara Humpton, USA Rare Earth CEO.\n\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick praised the news, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the US supply chain is not dependent on foreign countries.\n\n\"USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,\" he said.",

    "title": "\"Bitcoin Jesus\" Avoided Prison, Thanks to One of the \"Friends of Trump\"",
    "description": "Billionaire fugitive Roger Ver was facing federal criminal charges until he sought the services of a select club of President Donald Trump’s former personal attorneys who have easy access to top Justice Department appointees.",
    "fullText": "These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nDays into President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, a cryptocurrency billionaire posted a video on X to his hundreds of thousands of followers. “Please Donald Trump, I need your help,” he said, wearing a flag pin askew and seated awkwardly in an armchair. “I am an American. … Help me come home.”\n\nThe speaker, 46-year-old Roger Ver, was in fact no longer a U.S. citizen. Nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early evangelism for digital currency, Ver had renounced his citizenship more than a decade earlier. At the time of his video, Ver was under criminal indictment for millions in tax evasion and living on the Spanish island of Mallorca. His top-flight legal defense team had failed around half a dozen times to persuade the Justice Department to back down. The U.S., considering him a fugitive, was seeking his extradition from Spain, and he was likely looking at prison.\n\nOnce, prosecutors hoped to make Ver a marquee example amid concerns about widespread cryptocurrency tax evasion. They had spent eight painstaking years working the case. Just nine months after his direct-to-camera appeal, however, Ver and Trump’s new Justice Department leadership cut a remarkable deal to end his prosecution. Ver wouldn’t have to plead guilty or spend a day in prison. Instead, the government accepted a payout of $49.9 million — roughly the size of the tax bill prosecutors said he dodged in the first place — and allowed him to walk away.\n\nVer was able to pull off this coup by taking advantage of a new dynamic inside of Trump’s Department of Justice. A cottage industry of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants with close ties to Trump has sprung up to help people and companies seek leniency, often by arguing they had been victims of political persecution by the Biden administration. In his first year, Trump issued pardons or clemency to dozens of people who were convicted of various forms of white-collar crime, including major donors and political allies. Investigations have been halted. Cases have been dropped.\n\nWithin the Justice Department, a select club of Trump’s former personal attorneys have easy access to the top appointees, some of whom also previously represented Trump. It has become a dark joke among career prosecutors to refer to these lawyers as the “Friends of Trump.”\n\nThe Ver episode, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals the extent to which white-collar criminal enforcement has eroded under the Trump administration. The account is based on interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, case records and conversations with people familiar with his case.\n\nThe Trump administration has particularly upended the way tax law violators are handled. Late last year, the administration essentially dissolved the team dedicated to criminal tax enforcement, dividing responsibility among a number of other offices and divisions. Tax prosecutions fell by more than a quarter, and more than a third of the 80 experienced prosecutors working on criminal tax cases have quit.\n\nBut even amid this turmoil, Ver’s case stands out. After Ver added several of these new power brokers to his team — most importantly, former Trump attorney Chris Kise — Trump appointees commandeered the case from career prosecutors. One newly installed Justice Department leader who had previously represented Trump’s family questioned his new subordinates on whether tax evasion should be a criminal offense. Ver’s team wielded unusual control over the final deal, down to dictating that the agreement would not include the word “fraud.”\n\nIt remains the only tax prosecution the administration has killed outright.\n\nVer did not reply to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica. In court filings and dealings with the Justice Department, Ver had always denied dodging his tax bill intentionally — a key distinction between a criminal and civil tax violation — and claimed to have relied on the advice of accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n“Roger Ver took full responsibility for his gross financial misconduct to the tune of $50 million because this Department of Justice did not shy away from exposing those who cheat the system. The notion that any defendant can buy their way out of accountability under this administration is not founded in reality,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson.\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions, the White House referred ProPublica to the Justice Department.“I know of no cases like this,” said Scott Schumacher, a former tax prosecutor and the director of the graduate program in taxation at the University of Washington. It is nearly unheard of for the department to abandon an indicted criminal case years in the making. “They’re basically saying you can buy your way out of a tax evasion prosecution.”\n\nRoger Ver is not a longtime ally of Trump’s or a MAGA loyalist. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, a day he once called “the happiest day of my entire life.” In the early days of bitcoin, he controlled about 1% of the world’s supply.\n\nVer is clean-cut and fit — he has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. In his early 20s, while he was a libertarian activist in California, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for illegally selling explosives on eBay. He’s often characterized that first brush with the law as political persecution by the state. After his release, he left the U.S. for Japan.\n\nVer became a fixture in the 2010s on the budding cryptocurrency conference circuit, where he got a kick out of needling government authority and arguing that crypto was the building block of a libertarian utopia. At a 2017 blockchain conference in Aspen, Colorado, Ver announced he had raised $100 million and was seeking a location to create a new “non-country” without any central government. For years, Ver has recommended other wealthy people consider citizenship in the small Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has no individual income tax.\n\n“Bitcoin completely undermines the power of every single government on the entire planet to control the money supply, to tax people’s income to control them in any way,” he told a gathering of anarcho-capitalists in Acapulco, Mexico, in 2016. “It makes it so incredibly easy for people to hide their income or evade taxes.” More than one friend, he said with a smirk, had asked him how to do so: They “say, ‘Roger, I need your help. How do I use bitcoins to avoid paying taxes on it?’”\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship isn’t a magic get-out-of-tax-free technique. Since 2008, the U.S. has required expatriates with assets above $2 million pay a steep “exit tax” on the appreciation of all their property.\n\nIn 2024, the Justice Department indicted Ver in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency tax fraud cases. The government accused Ver of lying to the IRS twice. After Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, he claimed to the IRS that he personally did not own any bitcoin. He would later admit in his deal with the government to owning at least 130,664 bitcoin worth approximately $73.7 million at the time. Then in 2017, the government alleged, Ver tried to conceal the transfer of roughly $240 million in bitcoin from U.S. companies to his personal accounts. In all, the government said he had evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.\n\nVer’s defense was that his failure to pay taxes arose from a lack of clarity as to how tax law treated emerging cryptocurrency, good-faith accounting errors and reliance on his advisors’ advice. He claimed it was difficult to distinguish between his personal assets and his companies’ holdings and pinpoint what the bitcoin was actually worth.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Justice Department dismissed this legal argument. Prosecutors had troves of emails that they said showed Ver misleading his own attorneys and tax preparers about the extent of his bitcoin holdings. (Ver’s team accused the government of taking his statements out of context.) The asset tracing in the case was “rock solid,” according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A jury, prosecutors maintained, was unlikely to buy Ver’s defense that he made a good-faith error.\n\nIn Trump, Ver saw a possible way out. After the 2024 election, he was “barking up every tree,” said his friend Brock Pierce, a fellow ultrawealthy crypto investor who tried to gin up sympathy for Ver in Trump’s orbit.\n\nVer had initially gone the orthodox route of hiring tax attorneys from a prestigious law firm, Steptoe. Like many wealthy people in legal jeopardy, Ver now also launched a media blitz seeking a pardon from the incoming president.“If anybody knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare it’s Trump, so I think he’ll be able to see it in this case as well,” Ver said in a December 2024 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show. On Charlie Kirk’s show, Ver appeared with tape over his mouth with the word “censored” written in red ink. Laura Loomer, the Trump-friendly influencer, began posting that Ver’s prosecution was unfair. Ver paid Trump insider Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby Congress for an end to the tax provision he was accused of violating.\n\nVer’s pardon campaign fizzled. His public pressure campaign — in which he kept comparing himself to Trump — was not landing, according to Pierce. “You aren’t doing yourself any favors — shut up,” his friend recalled saying.\n\nOne objection in the White House, according to a person who works on pardons, may have been Ver’s flamboyant rejection of his American citizenship. Less than a week after Trump was inaugurated, Elon Musk weighed in, posting on X, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.”\n\nBut inside the Justice Department, Ver found an opening. The skeleton key proved to be one of the “Friends of Trump,” a seasoned defense lawyer named Christopher Kise. Kise is a longtime Florida Republican power player who served as the state’s solicitor general and has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He earned a place in Trump’s inner circle as one of the first experienced criminal defenders willing to represent the president after his 2020 election loss. Kise defended Trump in the Justice Department investigation stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and against charges that Trump mishandled classified documents when leaving the White House.\n\nKise had worked shoulder-to-shoulder on Trump’s cases with two lawyers who were now leaders in the Trump 2.0 Justice Department: Todd Blanche, who runs day-to-day operations at the department as deputy attorney general, and his associate deputy attorney general, Ketan Bhirud, who oversaw the criminal tax division prosecuting Ver. Kise reportedly helped select Blanche to join Trump’s legal team in the documents case, and he and Bhirud had both worked for Trump’s family as they fought civil fraud charges brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2022.\n\nOn Ver’s legal team, Kise worked the phones, pressing his old colleagues to rethink their prosecution against Ver.\n\nKise scored the legal team’s first big victory in years: a meeting with Bhirud that cut out the career attorneys most familiar with the merits of the case.\n\nIn that meeting, however, it wasn’t clear that the new Justice Department leadership would be willing to interfere with the trajectory of Ver’s case. While the Trump administration had backed off aggressive enforcement of white-collar crimes writ large, the administration said it was still pursuing most criminal cases that had already been charged.\n\nBhirud initially expressed skepticism that Ver accidentally underpaid his taxes. It was “hard to believe” that a man going by “Bitcoin Jesus” would have no idea how much bitcoin he owned, Bhirud said, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nBhirud and Blanche did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.\n\nThe Justice Department stuck to its position that either Ver would plead guilty to a crime, or the case would go to trial.\n\nBut Kise would not stop lobbying his former colleagues to reconsider. Blanche and Bhirud had already demanded that career officials justify the case again and again. Over the course of the summer, Kise wore down the Trump appointees’ zeal for pursuing Ver on criminal charges.\n\nKise and the law firm of Steptoe did not respond to questions.\n\n“While there were meetings and conversations with DOJ, that is not uncommon. The line attorneys remained engaged throughout the process, and the case was ultimately resolved based on the strength of the evidence,” said Bryan Skarlatos, one of Ver’s tax attorneys and a partner at Kostelanetz.\n\nIt was a chaotic moment at the Justice Department, an institution that Trump had incessantly accused of being “weaponized” against him and his supporters. After Trump took office, the department was flooded with requests to reconsider prosecutions, with defendants claiming the Biden administration had singled them out for political persecution, too.\n\nWhile many cases failed to grab the administration’s attention, Kise got results. Last week, Kise’s client Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian billionaire accused of trying to bribe the former governor of Puerto Rico, received a pardon from Trump.\n\n“Every defense attorney is running the ‘weaponization’ play. This guy gets an audience because of who he is, because his name is Chris Kise,” said a person who recently attended a high-level meeting Kise secured to talk the Justice Department down from prosecuting a client.\n\nAs Kise stepped up the pressure, Ver’s case ate up a significant share of Bhirud’s time, despite his job overseeing more than 1,000 Justice Department attorneys, according to people familiar with the matter. Ordinarily, it would be rare for a political appointee to be so involved, especially to the exclusion of career prosecutors who could weigh in on the merits.\n\nBhirud began to muse to coworkers about whether failure to pay one’s taxes should really be considered a crime. Wasn’t it more of a civil matter? It seemed to a colleague that Bhirud was aware Ver’s advocates could try to elevate the case to the White House.\n\nThe government ceded ground and offered to take prison time off the table. Eventually, Ver’s team and Bhirud hit on the deal that would baffle criminal tax experts. They agreed on a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow Ver to avoid criminal charges and prison in exchange for a payout and an agreement not to violate any more laws. The government usually reserves such an agreement for lawbreaking corporations to avoid putting large employers out of business — not for fugitive billionaires.\n\nVer’s team enjoyed a remarkable ability to dictate terms. They rejected the text of the government’s supposed final offer because it required him to admit to “fraud,” according to a person familiar with the negotiations. In the end, Ver agreed to admit only to a “willful” failure to report and pay taxes on all his bitcoin and turned over the $50 million.\n\nThe government arrived at that figure in a roundabout manner. It dropped its claim that Ver had lied on his 2017 tax return. The $50 million figure was based on how much he had evaded in taxes in 2014 alone, plus what the government asserted were interest and penalties. In the end, the deal amounted to the sum he allegedly owed in the first place. He never even had to leave Mallorca to appear in a U.S. court.\n\nUnder any previous administration, convincing the leadership of the tax division to drop an indicted criminal case and accept a monetary penalty instead would be a nonstarter. While the Justice Department settles most tax matters civilly through fines, when prosecutors do charge criminal fraud, their conviction rate is over 90%.\n\nPeople “always ask you, ‘Can’t I just pay the taxes and it’ll go away?’” said Jack Townsend, a former DOJ tax attorney. “The common answer that everybody gave — until the Trump administration — was that, no, you can’t do that.”\n\nWhen the Justice Department announced the resolution in October, it touted it as a victory.\n\n“We are pleased that Mr. Ver has taken responsibility for his past misconduct and satisfied his obligations to the American public,” Bhirud said in the Justice Department’s press release announcing the deferred prosecution agreement. “This resolution sends a clear message: whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe.”\n\nInside the Justice Department, the resolution was demoralizing: “He’s admitted he owes money, and we get money, but everything else about it stinks to high heaven,” said a current DOJ official familiar with the case. “We shouldn’t negotiate with people who are fugitives, as if they have power over us.”\n\nAmong the wealthy targets of white-collar criminal investigations, the Ver affair sent a different message. Lawyers who specialize in that kind of work told ProPublica that more and more clients are asking which of the “Friends of Trump” they should hire. One prominent criminal tax defense lawyer said he would give his clients a copy of Ver’s agreement and tell them, “These are the guys who got this done.”\n\nThe only one of Ver’s many lawyers to sign it was Christopher Kise.",

What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "description": "The president raised a fuss about his ballroom project as a federal judge considers an injunction.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against legal efforts to stop the construction of a massive ballroom on the grounds of the White House.\n\n“There is no practical or reasonable way to go back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “IT IS TOO LATE!”\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation last month sued to block the construction of the ballroom after Trump last year demolished the East Wing with little notice to make room for the new building, which will dwarf the main residence.\n\n“The so-called ‘preservationists,’ who get their money from the most unusual of places, should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House, a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance, because of the special grounds on which it sits, no matter how big (and important!), that enhancement may be.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon last week questioned the administration’s legal authority on the project and seemed skeptical as he considers a potential injunction. The judge said he would decide next month.\n\nTrump has said the up to $400 million cost of the ballroom will be funded by private donations, raising ethical and other questions that the White House has yet to answer.\n\nBut on Sunday, he defended the planned facility as “a great, big, beautiful gift to the United States of America” and complained that the East Wing had been “bastardized” by previous renovations.\n\nTrump also said that the lawsuit has caused “top secret” information about the project to emerge.\n\nPolitics: U.S. Senator Comes Out And Says It About Trump: 'Invoke The 25th Amendment'\n\n“Additionally, in this instance, it is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nWhile he did not get more specific, the East Wing was known to house the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ― aka the “underground bunker,” which Trump reportedly used during protests in 2020 ― and the new project is likely to replace and/or upgrade the facility.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the project, which he frequently brings up unprompted. Earlier this month, he even interrupted a White House meeting with oil industry executives to get up, wander over to a window, and stare at the construction site.\n\nTrump on Sunday fired off messages on Truth Social about a number of topics including complaints about the NFL, Canada and journalist Don Lemon. He also wrote some messages about the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis, which has only grown more tense after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nPolitics: National Trust Warns Trump's Ballroom Will 'Overwhelm' White House\n\nBut it was his message about the ballroom that he pinned to the top of his feed.\n\nThe Architect Doing Trump's Ballroom Also Thinks It's Way Too Big: Report\n\n'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nHere's Who Has Been Surprisingly Willing To Defy Trump In His Second Term",

    "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China.  Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China. He was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America’s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing.\n\nCarney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.\n\nTrump claims otherwise, posting that “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT”\n\nThe prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.\n\n“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”\n\nIn 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.\n\nBreaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.\n\nCarney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.\n\nTrump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.\n\n“A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nTrump's post on Saturday said that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”\n\n“We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“We have a (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), but based off -- based on that, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”\n\nTrump’s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance.\n\nCarney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump’s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.\n\nTrump’s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump shared two screenshots of text exchanges with NATO Secretary General and the French President.\n\nThe posts show that even top-level diplomacy can become social media fodder.\n\nEnd-to-end apps can encrypt messages, but experts say technology can't protect against betrayal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump “daddy” now.\n\nEuropean leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying “no,” or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible.\n\n\"Red lines\" were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States “absolutely” must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.\n\n“Britain will not yield\" its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said “Europe will not be blackmailed” over Greenland.\n\n“Threats have no place among allies,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nThe tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term — see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBut the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from “appeasing” Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say “no” to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.\n\n“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it,” Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”\n\nIn recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the “fiction” that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year.\n\n“When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we have learned something.”\n\nFederiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, “We are not a bad ally,” after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was “not being a good ally.”\n\nTrump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no “need (for) international law,” he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada.\n\n“In Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,” said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.\n\n“It's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,\" Shanahan said. \"It is hard for them to change.”\n\nFive months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize.\n\nSecretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's “Trump whisperer,\" likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl.\n\nLesson 2: Consider saying no — and make choices accordingly\n\nTraditional diplomacy exists to preserve possibilities of working together. That often means avoiding saying a flat “no” if possible. But Trump's Greenland gambit was so stark a threat from one NATO member to another that Greenland's prime minister actually said the word.\n\n“Enough,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a statement shortly after Trump's remarks Jan. 5. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation.”\n\nThat played a part in setting the tone. Denmark's leader said any such invasion of Greenland would mark the end of NATO and urged alliance members to take the threat seriously.\n\nThey did, issuing statement after statement rejecting the renewed threat. Trump responded last weekend from his golf course in Florida with a threat to charge a 10% import tax within a month on goods from eight European nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate, he wrote, would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.\n\nLesson 3: Reject Trump's big-power paradigm\n\nTrump's fighting words lit a fire among leaders arriving in Davos. But they seemed to recognize, too, that the wider Trump world left him vulnerable.\n\n“Trump was in a fairly weak position because he has a lot of other looming problems going on,” domestically, including an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on his tariffs and a backlash to immigration raids in Minnesota, said Duncan Snidal, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford University and the University of Chicago.\n\nCanada's Carney said no by reframing the question not as being about Greenland, but about whether it was time for European countries to build power together against a “bully\" — and his answer was yes.\n\nWithout naming the U.S. or Trump, Carney spoke bluntly: Europe, he said, should reject the big power's “coercion” and “exploitation.\" It was time to accept, he said, that a “rupture” in the alliance, not a transition, had occurred.\n\nUnsaid, Snidel pointed out, was that the rupture was very new, and though it might be difficult to repair in the future, doing so under adjusted rules remains in U.S. and European interests beyond Trump's presidency. “It's too good a deal for all of them not to,” Snidel said.\n\nBefore Trump stepped away from the podium in Davos, he had begun to back down.\n\nHe canceled his threat to use “force” to take over Greenland. Not long after, he reversed himself fully, announcing “the framework\" for a deal that would make his tariff threat unnecessary.\n\nTrump told Fox Business that “we’re going to have total access to Greenland,” under the “framework,\" without divulging what that might mean.\n\nFrederiksen hit the warning button again. In a statement, she said, “We cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"",

    "title": "Trump's surprising new source for 'affordability' ideas",
    "description": "Trump is rolling out a slew of new ideas focused on \"affordability.\" A lot of them sound like proposals from Zohran Mamdani or Bernie Sanders.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump seems to have realized the American public is not picking up what he's putting down on the economy, so he's borrowing a fresh set of ideas from an unlikely place — the other side of the aisle.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the White House has rolled out a blitz of proposals that sound more like something out of Bernie Sanders', Elizabeth Warren's, or Zohran Mamdani's offices than a Republican administration. Trump has called for institutional investors to be banned from buying single-family homes, and he's sought to block military contractors from undertaking stock buybacks and issuing dividends unless they step it up on production. He's also revived a pledge from the campaign trail to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. These moves follow a proposal late last year for what the White House dubbed \"Trump accounts,\" a small-scale version of baby bonds that would allot $1,000 to children born from 2025 through 2028.\n\nStock buyback bans, credit card interest rate caps, baby bonds: These are all ideas progressives have been kicking around for years.\n\nTrump has tended to take a heterodox approach to the economy that diverges from the more typical Republican \"let the chips fall where they may\" stance on markets. He's used his bully pulpit to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas and weighed in on mergers from the Oval Office. During his second term, the federal government has taken equity stakes in multiple American companies, marking a shift toward a more heavy-handed, interventionist approach to private industry. Now, Trump's original messaging on how to reshape the economy has faltered — it turns out Americans really love cheap stuff — so he's pivoting in what he hopes will be a more popular direction.\n\nIt's not clear how much of this is serious or achievable. And some items on Trump's agenda — namely, tariffs — stand to undercut any affordability-related measures. A cost-alleviating campaign also requires focus, and the president is prone to distraction, whether it be his recent push to acquire Greenland or his tendency to pick small fights with allies. However, the blitz of announcements is a sign that Trump recognizes his playbook wasn't appeasing the financially frustrated masses. And the ongoing shift toward more populist economic policies — wherever the ideas come from — is evidence of a broader shift away from market-first thinking that's dominated both the Republican and Democratic parties for decades.\n\nTrump's second administration came into power with a fairly cohesive theory of how to better the economy and improve Americans' poor perceptions of it. Through a combination of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and overhauling the federal government via DOGE, the Trump team anticipated an investment boom, particularly in manufacturing, that would lead to a significant boost to the economy. Things haven't really panned out as anticipated: The US lost manufacturing jobs in 2025, tariffs were mainly a headache for businesses and consumers, and while hard economic data shows solid growth, people's views on how things are going are much more dour.\n\nAmericans remain frustrated by high prices and a job market that's mediocre at best. They weren't sold on White House's initial message telling them to just buy less stuff, and the more recent line that concerns around affordability are a \"hoax\" didn't play great either. Which brings us to the White House's plan C: scrounging through various bags of tricks to see if there's anything good in there.\n\n\"They're scrambling to find things to do,\" says Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project.\n\nMany of these new policy proposals have been percolating in Democratic offices for a while. Sanders has a bill to limit credit card interest rates, and he's said in the past that he'd work with Trump on the issue. Sen. Cory Booker is a longtime proponent of baby bonds, Warren has criticized buybacks as a \"sugar high\" for corporations, and kicking private equity funds out of the housing market is a lively debate on the left.\n\nTrump's maneuvers aren't out of nowhere. He's never been a straight Reaganite, free-market-above-all Republican on the economy. Some of the issues he's targeting are ones that have garnered GOP support in the past. It's also clear that Mamdani's victory in New York City's mayoral race, thanks in large part to his affordability message, caught the president's attention. The horseshoe theory of politics suggests that the left and right are bound to intersect on certain issues, especially with a right-leaning president who is open to meddling directly into all kinds of matters. The president himself has acknowledged the atypical nature of his proposals — in an interview with CNBC, he joked that the credit card interest rate cap \"sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that.\"\n\n\"Right-wing populists and left-wing progressives are both populists of a sort,\" says James Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. They tend to frame things as \"the people vs. the elite,\" though their exact targets may differ. They don't worry about economic overreach or accept constraints that political moderates might take as a given.\n\n\"When someone says, 'Oh, we can't afford it,' or, 'Well, the rules don't really allow it,' Or, 'Oh, we can't do this because the markets won't like it,' I mean, those are not answers that populists and progressives like Elizabeth Warren will readily accept,\" Pethokoukis says.\n\nIn an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me that President Trump was given a \"resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, DC's obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down.\" He said Trump is turning the page on the Biden administration's \"economic disaster\" by implementing traditional free market policies such as deregulation and tax cuts, while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\" In other words, they appear to be willing to get down and dirty on some issues.\n\nIf you're skeptical that Trump's embrace of these ideas will lead to a big bipartisan kumbaya moment, you would be correct. For one thing, the president tends to toss out declarations that aren't always straightforward or within his power to accomplish.\n\nThere are practical concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of these plans. As it stands, there does not appear to be a political consensus on these ideas to bring them to fruition. A credit card interest rate cap, for example, would likely need congressional buy-in to implement. Historically, there has been little interest among legislators beyond progressives such as Warren, Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Members of Trump's own party have pushed back, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who suggested the president \"probably has not thought through\" the cap. The president may be able to leverage government contracts to influence defense companies, such as Raytheon, but there aren't always obvious, immediate alternative suppliers for certain products. Companies also can't shift gears overnight.\n\n\"A lot of these things they seem to be trying to do on the cheap,\" says Brad Lipton, the director of corporate power and financial regulation at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. \"It's not serious industrial policy to just kind of do these one-off things.\"\n\nThen there are the questions of effectiveness. Take the idea of banning large institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes. Entities such as Blackstone have become a \"useful scapegoat\" for rising housing costs in the US, says Jenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, a policy advocacy group, but they're not the root of the problem. There are some 85 million single-family homes in the US; large institutions own about half a million of them, less than 1%.\n\nThere are some places where institutional investment ownership is concentrated, including Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and Phoenix. While many Americans may instinctively balk at the idea of a private equity fund owning a cluster of homes, it's not unequivocally a bad thing. Having a group of houses together may help them keep down maintenance and amenities costs, and it opens up the door for renters to get into areas — and school districts — they might not be able to access if they had to buy.\n\n\"These institutional investors now operating as landlords are reallocating a very scarce good,\" says Caitlin Gorback, a microeconomist and assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business. \"When you're reallocating a scarce good, there are winners and losers. I think we've really been concerned about the losers.\"\n\nThere's only so much the federal government can do on housing at all, since most of what's needed to address the issue is on the state and local level. At the federal level, the president has also said he wants the government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds in order to bring down mortgage rates and floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage. Some economists note that those moves could actually worsen the situation by juicing demand without increasing supply.\n\n\"Huge monetary stimulus for mortgages is not really what the housing market needs right now,\" Konczal says. \"What it really needs is more housing.\"\n\nFinally, the president's own record has led many economists and policy experts to question his commitment to these causes. Trump isn't wrong to think that credit cards and debt are dogging many Americans. Credit card debt in the US is near record highs, and the average credit card interest rate is 23.79%, according to LendingTree, which is approximately 10 percentage points higher than it was a decade ago. Despite the president's rhetoric on the issue, however, his administration has actually exacerbated the problem. Last year, the president signed a resolution nullifying a Biden-era rule that would have limited overdraft fees to $5, and under his watch, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tabled a rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.\n\nIn December, the president signed a required annual defense bill that was stripped of a bipartisan housing measure aimed at increasing the housing supply and therefore bringing down costs.\n\n\"They just weren't interested,\" Lipton says.\n\nIn mid-January, Sen. Warren said in a statement she had a call with the president in which they discussed credit card interest rate limits and the housing bill.\n\n\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it. I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs,\" she said. \"No more delays. It's time to deliver relief for American families.\"\n\nThe president seems to be clear on his desire to take more direct action on the economy, though the why behind it is a separate story.\n\nOn both the right and the left, there's been a creep toward the government taking a more hands-on approach toward industry and the economy over the past decade. The Biden administration embraced industrial policy through legislation, such as the CHIPS Act, and sought to lower consumer costs by cracking down on junk fees. The Trump administration is taking stakes in companies such as Intel and MP Materials, and it's cut profit-sharing deals tied to AI chip exports. History doesn't move backward — these types of actions under both political parties are likely to continue to ramp up.\n\nWhat sets Trump's latest interventions apart is not that they borrow from progressive proposals; it's that they lack a clear thesis about the problems they're meant to solve. These policies appear reactive, shaped more by political pressure and public anger than by a coherent economic framework. They've also been presented alongside a fresh set of tariff threats on Europe that would likely push prices up. Even though those tariffs have since been abandoned, they could come back. There's an understanding from the White House that Americans are dissatisfied with the country's financial state of affairs, they increasingly blame Trump for it. Therefore, the president needs to appear like he's doing something. That something, however, is all over the place.\n\n\"A lot of policy is downstream of how you diagnose the problem, and I think their diagnosis is wrong, which is why the policies don't fit really well,\" Konczal says. \"They're doing a lot of victory laps on, 'Aha, the economy didn't collapse!' And it's like, yes, it did not. But what are we excited about? What's going to be on the other side of this?\"\n\nThat's an open question. Trump can't do a lot of this on his own, and congressional Republicans aren't exactly lining up to cap credit card interest rates or clamp down on stock buybacks and executive pay. But as the White House works to shape its affordability narrative, we might expect more Sanders-esque proposals.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Trump posted screenshots of messages from Macron and NATO's chief, highlighting how private diplomacy — and work chats — can quickly become public.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

What the f*ck is wrong with you?” the woman yelled as ICE agents surrounded their target and dragged him to the ground. As ICE continued to wrestle with the man, a shot rang out, followed by multiple more shots as the officers moved away from the victim.\n\nThe woman holding the camera screamed and moved away from the scene before returning and yelling repeatedly, “What the f*ck did you do?!”\n\nThe video then showed the man lying on his back motionless as the ICE officers backed away, some with guns pointed at the victim.\n\nOthers were heard screaming in the background as the person with the orange backpack ran toward the woman recording.\n\n“Oh, my God, Oh, my God! What the f*ck did you just do?” the woman yelled repeatedly as the ICE agents stood over the man.\n\n“Someone call the ambulance!” the woman yelled over and over as another person yelled “Call 9-1-1!”\n\n“Somebody call 9-1-1! I can’t believe they just did that!” the woman recording screamed. “Holy sh*t, holy sh*t!” she yelled while recording an ice agent kneeling next to the victim.\n\n“Oh, my God, you f*cking people, man! You’re f*cking killing us!” she yelled. “Why would you do that?!”\n\nOne ICE officer then prodded the victim’s leg, but the victim did not move.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m seeing this!” the woman cried as more of the officers knelt around the man.\n\nThe victim was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nLater Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino gave a press conference during which he claimed the man had a gun and meant the agents harm.\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” he said.\n\nThe post WATCH: Stunning New Close-Range Video Of Trump Feds Shooting Man first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump filed a $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase and its CEO Jamie Dimon on Thursday for closing his accounts allegedly for political reasons.\n\nHere is a look at Trump's claims and how the case could play out:\n\nThe largest U.S. bank closed accounts of several Trump businesses in ​April 2021 after they had been customers for decades, according to Trump's lawsuit. JPMorgan notified Trump of the closures about a month after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol ‌building on January 6, 2021.\n\nTrump said the bank's motivation was political and that JPMorgan violated Florida law barring unfair trade practices and acted in bad faith.\n\nTrump also accused Dimon of ordering a malicious \"blacklist\" to warn other banks about doing business with the ‌Trump Organization, Trump family members and Trump himself. Trump said the publication of this blacklist amounted to trade libel under Florida law and said his businesses suffered considerable financial and reputational harm as a result.\n\nThe suit comes after Dimon criticized Trump's immigration policies and proposal to cap interest rates that banks charge on credit cards.\n\nJPMorgan denied wrongdoing, said the lawsuit had no merit and that it closes accounts that create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\n\nWHAT WILL TRUMP HAVE TO SHOW TO PREVAIL?\n\nThe case will likely boil down to whether Trump's legal team can prove the bank canceled the accounts because of his political viewpoints. Terms of banking ⁠agreements tend to strongly favor the banks, which do not need ‌to provide a reason for closing an account and customers often don't know why their accounts are terminated.\n\nIn this case, Trump said JPMorgan gave a 60-day notice of the account closure but did not provide a reason.\n\nBanks must monitor their customers for a variety of potential risks, and a customer who had an account ‍closed because of banned activity such as money laundering would have no grounds to challenge it.\n\nHowever, some reasons for terminating an account might be considered an unfair trade practice or bad faith, including closing an account due to a customer's religion or ethnicity.\n\nLegal experts said canceling an account because of an accountholder's political viewpoint, which JPMorgan said it does not do, would likely be impermissible.\n\nHowever, it might be legal if an accountholder's views were so extreme ​they undermined trust in the bank. Trump could argue that his political views were mainstream as he had just amassed more than 70 million votes in losing the November 2020 election.",

    "fullText": "If there's one thing student-loan borrowers are familiar with, it's uncertainty — and there's a lot of that right now.\n\nAround the time it was set to take effect in early January, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced that it was pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted student-loan borrowers. This gives borrowers behind on payments more time to find a way back to good standing, but it's unclear how much time they'll have.\n\nAs to when that pause will lift, not even servicers appear to know. An employee at a major student-loan servicer told Business Insider that they received communications about the pause just days before it was announced to the public, and they do not know when garnishment and treasury offsets will resume.\n\nWhile the pause is good news for borrowers and provides them with relief as tax season commences, student-loan forgiveness backlogs continue to weigh on the thousands waiting for their relief to be processed. A recent court filing from the Department of Education said that 734,221 income-driven repayment applications were pending as of December 31, 2025, and that 3,400 discharges were approved in December.\n\nThe department wrote in its filing that litigation over the SAVE income-driven repayment plan is preventing it from processing some borrowers' debt relief applications. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments and a short timeline to debt relief, has been blocked since July 2024, and the department's filing said that it is focusing on processing income-based repayment discharges for borrowers who became eligible for relief before April 2025, the month that the block on SAVE was expanded in court.\n\nDuring this time, the department said that it is \"evaluating the most effective way to resume discharges for the borrowers who would have become eligible under the SAVE Plan Final Rule criteria after the date of the injunction. Currently, the only cancellations taking place are for IBR borrowers who became eligible before April 2025.\"\n\nThe pause on consequences for defaulted borrowers provides some relief, while the pause on forgiveness processing prolongs uncertainty — and, with more repayment changes on the horizon, student-loan borrowers have described feeling stuck in limbo, unable to financially plan. Some policy experts and lawmakers have also said that while the pause for defaulted borrowers is needed relief, the uncertainty could put borrowers at risk.\n\nThe department said in a press release last week that the delay in collections is intended to give borrowers \"additional time to evaluate these new repayment options once they consolidate their loans or complete a repayment or rehabilitation agreement.\"\n\nWith all of the back-and-forth policy changes, it's difficult to keep track of what is, and isn't, happening for student-loan borrowers.\n\nThe main change that defaulted borrowers need to know is that their wages and other federal benefits should not be seized until the Department of Education announces that the pause is lifted.\n\n\"The Trump Administration is committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options, which will support a stronger financial future for borrowers and enhance the long-term health of the federal student loan portfolio,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last week.\n\nMeanwhile, borrowers should prepare for looming repayment changes, which were signed into law in Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nBeginning in July, the department will begin rolling out new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees. Additionally, over 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE could be kicked off the plan sooner than anticipated; the department announced a proposed settlement that, if approved, would give SAVE borrowers a limited time to enroll in a new plan and face higher payments.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, previously told Business Insider.",

    "description": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump were among the Davos attendees. The luxurious airplanes matched the grandeur of the high-flyers who  went to the WEF.",
    "fullText": "Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\n\nThat meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too.\n\nBusiness Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week.\n\nOn Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents.\n\nThe majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF.\n\nOthers landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance.\n\nFrom Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft.\n\nOn Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s.\n\nThroughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nGulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views.\n\nBusiness jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower.\n\nIt's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats.\n\nThese are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million.\n\nFlight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday.\n\nSome governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.\n\nDue to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft.\n\nSometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too.\n\nBusiness Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers.\n\nThe first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one.\n\nA handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer.\n\nIt's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail.\n\nFlight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday.\n\nJetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma.\n\nThis is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.\n\nEmmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris.\n\nHowever, it appears he left before Trump's speech.\n\nEven the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. \"Those beautiful sunglasses,\" Trump said. \"What the hell happened?\"\n\nMacron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem.\n\nA Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed.\n\nIt costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter.\n\nMore popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet.\n\nTrump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner.\n\nHowever, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it.\n\nThis week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One.\n\nHis press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force.\n\nThe Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year.\n\nHe flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday.\n\nCarney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,\" he said.\n\nThe above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is keeping her de facto chief of staff for another year despite President Donald Trump refusing to make the arrangement official—or long term.\n\nCorey Lewandowski has emerged as the second most powerful person at the Department of Homeland Security after Noem herself, despite being classified as an unpaid special government employee who can only work 130 days per calendar year.\n\nHe was accused last year of vastly undercounting his work hours, prompting the White House to begin monitoring his work schedule.\n\nHe stayed in the role throughout 2025, and has now been rehired for 2026, Axios reported.\n\nThe 54-year-old secretary, dubbed “ICE Barbie” by the Daily Beast for her habit of cosplaying as an immigration agent, and Lewandowski, 52, are both married to other people but have long been rumored to be having an affair described by one Trump administration official as the “worst-kept secret” in Washington, D.C.\n\nBoth have denied being romantically involved, but the rumors have been so persistent that Trump refused to let Lewandowski serve as Noem’s official chief of staff.\n\nLewandowski has nevertheless rarely left Noem’s side since she became secretary, amassing a staggering amount of power at DHS in the process.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, he travels with Noem to meet with world leaders, participates in high-level policy meetings, advises the secretary on personnel decisions, arranges contractor meetings, reviews contracts, and schedules the secretary’s meetings with DHS officials and lobbyists.\n\n“Kristi is the face of DHS. Corey is the brains. He gets things done,” a senior administration official told Axios.\n\nLast week, an Axios reporter spotted Lewandowski standing at a gate at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where he was apparently discussing DHS vendor contracts loudly on the phone. The former Trump campaign chief specifically mentioned data company Palantir as well as a drone program, according to the outlet.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told Axios that Palantir has had a contract with the U.S. government for 14 years but that Lewandowski had never worked with Palantir and was not involved in the company’s government contract.\n\nLast year, however, The Wall Street Journal reported that Lewandowski had arranged for Noem to meet with Palantir and had told DHS officials to give the company additional work. Weeks later, DHS updated an existing contract to give Palantir an additional $29.9 million.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Lewandowski and DHS for comment.\n\nAs a special government employee, Lewandowski is allowed to maintain all of his private business interests and does not have to file a public financial disclosure form.\n\nHe is still subject to federal conflict of interest laws, but he refuses to say how he makes money, according to Axios.\n\nHe also remains close to the president, having managed Trump’s presidential campaign for part of the 2016 election cycle and later serving as an adviser to the Trump 2024 team.\n\n“No one can really control Corey,” a senior official told Axios.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump gives. And he takes away.\n\nOffended by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's increasingly assertive posture toward the U.S., Trump revoked an invitation to join his Board of Peace. Many Western allies are suspicious of the organization, which is chaired by Trump and was initially formed to focus on maintaining the ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas but has grown into something skeptics fear could rival the United Nations.\n\nAppearing at the World Economic Forum, Trump spoke of imposing tariffs on Switzerland — which he ultimately lowered — because the country's leader “rubbed me the wrong way” during a phone call. Before shelving sweeping tariffs on multiple European countries, Trump pressed Denmark to “say yes” to the U.S. push to control Greenland “and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember,” he said, imperiling the NATO alliance.\n\nOver his decades in public life, Trump has never been one for niceties. But even by his standards, the tumult of the past week stood out because it crystallized his determination to erase the rules-based order that has governed U.S. foreign policy — and by extension most of the Western world — since World War II.\n\nThe president and his supporters have dismissed that approach as inefficient, overly focused on compromise and unresponsive to the needs of people contending with rapid economic change. But in its place, Trump is advancing a system that is poorly understood and could prove far less stable, driven by the whims of a single, often mercurial, leader who regularly demonstrates that personal flattery or animus can shape his decisions.\n\nReturning to the U.S. from Davos, home to the World Economic Forum, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said the phrase she heard “over and over” was that “we are entering this new world order” as she described a sense of confusion among allies.\n\n“It may be you just had a bad telephone call with the president and now you're going to have tariffs directed at you,” she told reporters. “This lack of stability and reliability, I think, is causing what were traditionally reliable trade partners to be saying to other countries, ‘Hey, maybe you and I should talk because I’m not sure about what’s going on with the United States.’”\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing\n\nThe Trump-centric approach to governing is hardly surprising for someone who accepted his first Republican presidential nomination in 2016 by declaring that “I alone can fix” the nation's problems. As he settles into his second term with a far more confident demeanor than his first, he has delighted supporters with his to-the-victor -goes-the-spoils style.\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, recently told the Atlantic that Trump is pursuing a “maximalist strategy” and that he must keep going “until you meet resistance.”\n\n“And we haven’t met any resistance,” Bannon said.\n\nThat's certainly true in Washington, where the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to check Trump's impulses. But leaders of other countries, who have spent much of Trump's administration trying to find ways to work with him, are increasingly vocal.\n\nCarney is quickly emerging as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. Speaking in Davos ahead of Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu.”\n\n“In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: to compete with each other for favor or to combine to create a third path with impact,” he continued. “We should not allow the rise of hard powers to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity, and rules will remain strong — if we choose to wield it together.”\n\nTrump did not take kindly to those remarks, responding with threats in Davos before yanking the Board of Peace invitation.\n\n“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”\n\nCarney, however, was unbowed, speaking of Canada as “an example to a world at sea” as he crafted a potential template for other world leaders navigating a new era.\n\n“We can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn’t destined to be warped toward authoritarianism and exclusion,” he said in a speech before a cabinet retreat in Quebec City.\n\nIn the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer blasted Trump on Friday for “insulting and frankly appalling” comments in which he expressed doubt that NATO would support the U.S. if requested. The president seemingly ignored that the only time Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty, which requires all member countries to help another member under threat, was invoked was after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.\n\nReferring to non-US troops, Trump told Fox Business Network, “You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.”\n\nStarmer, noting the 457 British personnel who died and those with life-long injuries, said he will “never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country.” Denmark, which Trump has belittled as “ungrateful” for U.S. protection during World War II, had the highest per capita death toll among coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nHis tactics have raised fears that Trump is imposing long-term damage on the U.S. standing in the world and encouraging countries to rethink their alliances and deepen their ties with China. Carney already traveled there earlier this month to meet with President Xi Jinping.\n\n“China’s leadership watched an American president fight with allies, insult world leaders, and engage in bizarre antics, and thought to themselves — this is nothing but good for us,” Jake Sullivan, former President Joe Biden's national security adviser, said in an email.\n\nThe administration is showing no sign of backing down. In a social media post referring to Canada's ties with Beijing, Trump said China “will eat them up.” And the Pentagon released a defense strategy late Friday telling allies to handle their own security.\n\nSen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, was in Davos and participated in a bipartisan delegation to Denmark with Murkowski that was intended to show unity amid Trump's bid for Greenland. Recalling his conversations with other leaders, he told reporters on Friday that Trump has shown he only backs down when countries like China “showed toughness and a resiliency.”\n\n“Those who were accommodating and who negotiated in good faith, like the EU, which did not impose retaliatory tariffs, seemed to have not won any of his respect,” Coons said. “They can reach their own conclusions, but it would seem to me that trying to find a way to accommodate him when the foundation of his demands about Greenland is unhinged … seem to me to suggest a course of action.”",

    "fullText": "It turns out trans student athletes aren’t the only ones who are having to contend with politicians keeping them from playing sports, now adult trans hockey players are facing challenges too.\n\nHarrison Browne, who starred in Heated Rivalry and was the first openly transgender pro hockey player, is speaking out against USA Hockey’s new eligibility policy, which doesn’t outright ban trans athletes, but makes it almost impossible for them to compete even in recreational leagues.\n\nBack in November, USA Hockey, the national governing body for hockey, which oversees the U.S. participation in the Olympics, quietly released a new Participant Eligibility Policy, but when Browne found out about it yesterday, he immediately took to Instagram to alert his followers to the updated anti-trans rules.\n\n“USA Hockey is basically telling me I can’t play in a recreational league with friends that I played my entire career with,” Browne told PRIDE. “I just think that’s crazy.\"\n\nThe new policy, which updates what previously was a much more inclusive version from 2019, will put strict rules on who can play in youth, junior, disabled, and adult hockey leagues when it goes into effect on April 1, 2026. According to the updated policy, trans athletes can still play in co-ed leagues, but they are restricted to their sex assigned at birth when it comes to sex-exclusive leagues.\n\n“In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy,” the policy reads.\n\nThis means that trans women would be forced to play in men’s leagues, and trans men would have to play in women’s leagues unless they take testosterone, in which case they wouldn’t be allowed in either space.\n\n“The safest spaces I’ve found are queer spaces, are women’s spaces,” Browne said, explaining that forcing trans women to play in men’s leagues wouldn’t be safe because they are still plagued by “homophobia and transphobic language, whether that’s on the ice or behind closed doors in the locker room.”\n\nWhile not an outright ban, this new policy will make it nearly impossible for trans hockey players to play in any league overseen by USA Hockey, which includes less competitive recreational leagues, often called “beer leagues” by players.\n\nWomen’s hockey leagues across the country are having to deal with the new policy, with some taking to social media to assure players that they are looking into what it will mean for them. The Seattle Women’s Hockey Club wrote on Instagram, “To our trans members: it is the board's firm belief that our community is better for having you in it. Hockey belongs to anyone who has ever picked up a stick or cheered on their team, and that includes you, regardless of what USA Hockey says.”\n\nBrowne places the blame for this shift from a fairly inclusive trans participation policy to one that, in practice, will likely keep many trans athletes from playing hockey squarely on President Donald Trump’s shoulders. “We can’t overlook the fact that the [Trump] Administration is putting a lot of pressure on sports organizations to make a stance against trans participation in sports,” he said.\n\nRepublicans frequently claim that their focus on trans women in sports is because they care about fairness, but the argument is specious and ignores the larger issues in the sport, Browne said.\n\n“Transgender women, transgender people are not the issue here,” he said. “It is socioeconomic status, it’s access. If you have access to better coaching, if you have access to better facilities, better equipment, better nutrition, you are automatically going to be a better athlete. What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 'Heated Rivalry's Harrison Browne says new anti-trans hockey policy is 'crazy' and blames Trump\n\nSo you finished 'Heated Rivalry': Here are 2 ways to get into hockey\n\n7 gayest moments from the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 (so far)\n\n5 times athletes lived out the plot of 'Heated Rivalry' in real life",

    "description": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. | As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.",
    "fullText": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.\n\n“We do not foresee investing in new phase 3 studies in a foreseeable futures [sic] in vaccines,” Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg TV, placing emphasis on the word “new.”\n\nWhen asked if the anti-vaccine climate is going to affect Moderna’s business and ability to develop more vaccines, Bancel said, “100%.”\n\nYou cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the U.S. market, or because of delays—regulatory-wise—or because your market is much smaller, because you don't have a recommendation by the government,” Bancel said yesterday on the ‍sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nCurrently, the company touts 12 viral or bacterial vaccine programs in phase 2 development or earlier, according to its online pipeline.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Moderna spokesperson pointed to the company’s priorities set out in its Nov. 20 earnings release. At the time, the mRNA specialist announced the discontinuation of four clinical mRNA programs and outlined a three-year business strategy with the goal of boosting revenue by 10% in 2026.\n\n“Over the next three years, we expect to build a large seasonal vaccine franchise for at-risk populations and invest the cash generated into oncology and rare disease therapeutics,” Bancel said at the time.\n\nThe November release also outlines Europe as “a significant market for respiratory virus vaccines.”\n\nThe Moderna spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for its current phase 2 infectious disease programs.\n\nBancel’s comments come days after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., rebuked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing the lawyer’s stance on vaccines as “anti-science.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Moderna and Pfizer raced to develop and deliver COVID-19 vaccines—Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively—to abate the worldwide pandemic. Their efforts and success prompted major revenue and investment not only into their companies but into the biopharma industry itself.\n\nBut over the last year, U.S. mistrust in vaccines has continued to accelerate, as long-time vaccine conspiracist RFK. Jr. divests and dismantles federal infrastructure for the science. Just this month, the CDC overhauled the longstanding U.S. childhood vaccine schedule, removing broad vaccination recommendations for COVID, flu, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\nFor Bancel, the falling-out means Moderna is turning its focus toward cancer. Earlier this week, the company shared five-year data for its Merck & Co.-partnered cancer vaccine, which, when combined with Keytruda, cut the risk of cancer recurrence or death by 49% in comparison to Keytruda alone.\n\nThe move isn’t shocking, as Moderna’s Kyle Holen, M.D., head of development, therapeutics and oncology, told Fierce in October that most of the company's upcoming investigational new drug applications will be in the oncology space. Holen cited the political climate for developing infectious disease vaccines and “a huge unmet need in cancer” as reasons behind the decision.\n\nThough Moderna is moving away from vaccines for infectious diseases, Bancel has expressed disappointment about the action.\n\n“It is sad for us to see that. Vaccines that have been proven for decades helping people around the world are not recommended anymore,” he told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“If you look at all healthcare interventions, getting a vaccine is one of the highest return investments in the same year—not 10 or 20 years out—to prevent cardiac attack,” the leader said about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, noting that the inoculations also prevent hospitalizations related to severe illness.\n\n“We tend to forget that hospitalization is a big deal,” Bancel continued. “If you are 67 years old, you get hospitalized—in a week, you can lose 10% of your muscle mass. Ten percent muscle mass doesn't seem a lot like this, but it might mean the difference between you being able to live a high-quality life and your life becoming living from your bed to your sofa. So that’s the message about vaccines.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "The correspondent recounted asking a question to the president in September related to the First Amendment.",
    "fullText": "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl recalled a specific encounter with President Donald Trump when asked if the president has ever made him “fear” for his safety.\n\nDuring an interview with comedian Hasan Minhaj released Wednesday, Karl pointed to an exchange with Trump in September. While standing with other reporters on the South Lawn, Karl asked the president about comments made by Attorney General Pam Bondi in the wake of the assassination of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s going to go after hate speech? Is that, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl said, according to a video of the interaction.\n\nTrump replied: “She’d probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”\n\n“Would that be appropriate?” Karl could be heard responding in the background, as Trump went on to say, “Maybe they will come after ABC. ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they’ll have to go after you.”\n\nIn his comments, the president appeared to reference how ABC News agreed in December 2024 to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over statements about Trump made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nKarl said he asked the president a “very simple question” and called his initial answer a “shocking moment.”\n\n“So the idea that the president of the United States is suggesting that the power of the Department of Justice could be brought to bear against journalists, who the president of the United States doesn’t believe are fair — that’s a very interesting reading of the First Amendment,\" Karl said.\n\nDuring the interview with Minhaj, Karl also discussed how a theme of Trump’s reelection campaign was vowing to “go after” his perceived political enemies. He pointed to his pardons of Jan. 6 rioters on the first day of his second term, as well as the “hollowing out” of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n“There’s nobody like at the White House now telling Donald Trump, ‘Look, sir, we really shouldn’t do this,’” Karl said. “I mean, people advise him, but it’s like he’s got the people around him who are going to carry out the orders.”",

    "description": "It's like the last few days never happened.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 closed up 0.55% yesterday on good news about U.S. GDP growth and President Trump retracting his threat to impose more tariffs on Europe if he isn’t given Greenland. After a selloff earlier this week, the S&P is again above 6,900 and within 1% of its all-time high. Gold hit another record yesterday, too.\n\nBut futures on the index were down 0.24% prior to the opening bell in New York and markets in Europe sold off slightly this morning after Asia closed mixed, a sign that traders are booking profits after yesterday’s rally. \n\nOn the macro front, Wall Street analysts are bullish. It’s a marked change from the fraught mood of the last few days.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s tariffs are turning out to be a much smaller economic deal than “earlier worst-case fears,” JPMorgan Chase says. Companies have adjusted their pricing and supply chains, and the result is “the realized tariff rate has been much lower at ~11% (versus expectations of 15%,”), according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team. “Only 14% of S&P 500 companies are highly sensitive to tariffs.”\n\nAnd it could get better if the U.S. Supreme Court decides the president lacks the power to unilaterally enact tariffs, the bank says.\n\n“Prediction markets assign >65% odds that the Supreme Court rules against the government, and those odds have consistently been against the government, especially following the November Supreme Court oral arguments,” Lakos-Bujas told clients.\n\nAnalysts were also cheered by a new upward revision for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of last year, at 4.4%.\n\n“The 4.4% real growth rate is much higher than normal and is likely to moderate over the course of the year, but if we can stay above 3% for the entire year it could lead to double-digit returns in the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management said in an email seen by Fortune.\n\nEY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco was singing from the same hymnbook. “Momentum was driven by resilient consumer spending, robust equipment and AI-related investment, a sizeable boost from net international trade, and a rebound in federal government outlays. The U.S. economy is neither overheating nor stalling—it is adjusting,” he said in a note.\n\nAll of that explains the calm we’re seeing in the markets today.\n\n“For some assets, it was almost like the selloff never happened, with the VIX index of volatility (-1.26pts) back at 15.64pts, which is beneath its levels prior to Saturday’s tariff announcements,” according to Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank.",

    "description": "He did not hold back against the media.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino harshly tore into the media during his first televised interview since departing President Donald Trump’s administration, describing outlets as having “a full diaper all the time.”\n\nBongino, a former Secret Service agent, officially returned to private life earlier this month after serving in his role in the FBI for less than a year. Since his departure, he announced he will return to hosting his self-titled podcast show in early February while becoming increasingly candid on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News late Thursday, Bongino accused the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nEarlier in the day, Axios reported — citing data from the Council on Criminal Justice — that the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900. However, the outlet noted that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade law during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office, indicating it raises questions about whether Trump’s policies have had an impact on the decline.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” Bongino told host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these dumba----.”\n\nHe then pointed to a story from The New York Times, which released interviews with 45 current and former employees who accused the FBI under its director, Kash Patel, of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?”\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge,“ he continued. ”Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country.\"\n\nBongino went on to say that the media is a “big full diaper,” adding he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity declared that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” noting that he was more restrained while working for the FBI.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”",

It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

    "fullText": "Is prison like the movies? The pardoned billionaire founder of Binance thinks so.\n\nChangpeng \"CZ\" Zhao pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering rules in 2023. He served four months in prison in 2024 and was pardoned by President Donald Trump in October 2025.\n\nSince then, Zhao has been \"pretty busy,\" he said in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin. He's working on a free education platform, an investment platform, and advises a dozen governments on crypto regulation, he said.\n\nEveryone wants to talk to Zhao about his prison experience, though, unless they're too afraid to ask. \"It's definitely a conversation starter,\" he said.\n\n\"My first roommate is a double murderer,\" Zhao said. \"He's been there for like twelve years, he still has 18 years to go, and then he got moved to a low-security prison.\"\n\nHe was a \"nice guy,\" Zhao added.\n\nZhao was surprised by his prison sentence, he said. He expected to be given home confinement.\n\nThe first day was \"pretty brutal,\" Zhao said. He described his strip search in detail, including prison staff searching his mouth and tongue as well as his genitalia.\n\nZhao's pardon has drawn scrutiny, with some onlookers questioning Trump's motives. Binance has promoted USD1, the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto asset manager backed by the Trump family.\n\n\"The American people deserve transparency regarding whether the pardon power was exercised impartially or influenced by personal financial interests,\" Rep. Robert Garcia wrote in a November letter.\n\nTrump also denied knowing who Zhao is in a \"60 Minutes\" interview following the pardon.\n\nIn his CNBC interview, Zhao also appeared to position himself as removed from the process. Of the pardon procedure, he said, \"I still don't know what the process is.\"\n\nZhao said his motivation for applying for a pardon came from media coverage speculating that he could receive one. After he applied, the administration was a \"black box.\"\n\n\"What people suggested the most is: get in front of Trump yourself,\" Zhao said. \"But I never got in front of Trump. I just waited and waited and waited, and suddenly it happened.\"\n\nHas he spoken to Trump? \"No, not yet,\" Zhao said.\n\nThe closest he's gotten, he said, was Trump's \"Board of Peace\" signing in Davos. Zhao was in the audience, some 30 to 40 feet away from the president who pardoned him.\n\n\"Never talked to him,\" he said. \"Never shook hands.\"",

    "fullText": "Jake Tapper shamed Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday after the White House press secretary lied about President Donald Trump confusing Greenland for Iceland in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\nPosting a video to his personal X account, the CNN host mocked Leavitt for arguing that the president wasn’t “mixing anything up.”\n\n“I mean, you know that that was filmed, right?” Tapper asked incredulously.\n\nWatch the video of Tapper’s breakdown — which includes the clips in question — below:\n\n“Earlier today, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump, at least three times referred to Greenland, a territory he wants to seize or purchase from Denmark, three times referred to Greenland as Iceland,” Tapper said before introducing Leavitt’s defense.\n\n“When a reporter went on X and pointed this out, the White House press secretary, whose salary your tax dollars pay for, wrote, ‘No he didn’t Libby, his written remarks referred to Greenland as a piece of ice because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here. OK?'”\n\nA claim to which Tapper replied: “Let’s roll the tape.”\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Wednesday, there were unmistakably several instances where Trump said “Iceland” when he meant to say “Greenland.” “When I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy,” he said in one moment; “Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money,” he said in another.\n\n“This all reminds me of this great, horrifying quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel ‘1984,’” Tapper pondered on his social video.\n\n“‘The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,'” the host quoted. “But we don’t live in 1984 and we don’t have to reject the evidence of our eyes and ears. We know that he confused Iceland with Greenland or Greenland with Iceland. And I mean, you can lie to us if you want, but I don’t know why it’s worth it.”\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Shames Karoline Leavitt for Lying About Trump’s Greenland-Iceland Mix-Up: ‘Let’s Roll the Tape’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

    "description": "The relationship between President Donald Trump and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has oscillated between public barbs and admissions of respect.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon is known for saying what he thinks. At Davos, the JPMorgan CEO was uncharacteristically constrained when talking about Donald Trump and his policies, striking a cautious balance between criticism and praise. \n\nThis is a familiar dance in a relationship that has swung between mutual respect and open hostility since Trump first took office in 2016.\n\nDimon, who once described himself as \"barely a Democrat,\" has publicly criticized some of Trump's economic and political policies, including on tariffs, while also praising his deregulatory moves and efforts to grow the economy.\n\n\"He was kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said in Davos in 2024, while in the same breath saying he didn't like some of Trump's rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump has filed suit against Dimon and JPMorgan for $5 billion over claims of politically-motivated debanking, here's a look at their relationship over the years.\n\nAlthough he financially supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for office, Dimon didn't publicly endorse a candidate that year, in 2012, or in 2016. He said in a memo following Trump's victory that his win reflected a \"deep desire for change\" across the country.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO sat on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that first met in February of 2017 and focused on how government policies affected economic growth. After Trump's inflammatory response to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the council, including Dimon, decided to disband the group.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump announced that he was disbanding the group in a post on then-Twitter.\n\nTrump said in the recent lawsuit that JPMorgan told him in February 2021 that it was closing his accounts, along with accounts of some of his family's businesses. Trump, along with some other conservatives, has criticized perceived politically motivated \"debanking\" in recent months, claiming that JPMorgan and other banks have shut down the accounts of conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican primaries, Dimon openly praised former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and advised Democrats to support her if they didn't want to face Trump again.\n\n\"Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, help Nikki Haley, too,\" he said at the DealBook Summit. \"Get a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\"\n\nDimon also said he was ready to work with Trump again, should he win reelection.\n\nThe banker's call for supporting Haley drew Trump's ire, with the then-former president calling Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's tone on Dimon changed during a 2024 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he said he had \"a lot of respect\" for the JPMorgan CEO.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" he added when asked if Dimon could be his next Treasury Secretary.\n\nTrump ramped up pressure on Dimon in the lead-up to the 2024 election, posting on Truth Social that Dimon had endorsed him.\n\nDimon denied he'd endorsed Trump through a JPMorgan spokesperson.\n\nThe pair's public relationship grew tense again in the summer of 2025, after Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.\n\nTrump told CNBC that JPMorgan and Bank of America had refused to accept his deposits, saying that the financial institutions \"discriminate against many conservatives.\"\n\nTrump's claims of discrimination gave way to his $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and its CEO. The bank denies any wrongdoing related to the closure of Trump's accounts, saying that account closures are sometimes required \"because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\"\n\n\"We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" reads a January statement from JPMorgan.\n\nHowever, the suit isn't the only recent point of tension between Trump and Dimon. Dimon has become more outspoken in his opposition to some of Trump's latest economic policies, including lambasting Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest as an \"economic disaster.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans.\n\nIn a January interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Dimon also reiterated his belief in the Fed's independence, which has come into question in recent days amid the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\nDimon said there was \"absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason\" that he would serve as Fed Chair, but he did say he would \"consider\" the job of Treasury Secretary — if it was offered.\n\nHe'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision, Dimon said.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "title": "What Trump could do next to open up the housing market, according to famed real estate investor Grant Cardone",
    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's ambition to take over Greenland may be on ice for now, but supporters of the Danish territory won't soon forget the affair.\n\nIn particular, Jesper Tønnesen, the Copenhagen shop owner whose MAGA parody hat went viral, told Business Insider he'll continue to raise support for Greenland's right to self-determination.\n\n\"You don't feel that you have any promises, because it can change again,\" he said of Trump's proposed deal with Denmark.\n\nTønnesen's business was thrust into the international spotlight over a red MAGA-style hat he designed late last year in protest of a US takeover of Greenland that read \"Nu det Nuuk,\" a twist on the Danish way of saying \"Now it's enough\" that used the name of Greenland's capital city.\n\nTønnesen said he was inspired by a parody \"Make America Go Away\" hat he had seen earlier, but he felt it was important to make a statement in his native language. The alternate MAGA phrase was also included on a side panel with a Greenland flag.\n\n\"Trump maybe took one step too much,\" he said of the threats to seize the NATO ally's territory. \"We can't communicate with him — we have to say, now it's enough, because we tried.\"\n\nAn initial run of 300 hats didn't get much traction at first, but search interest and copycat products surged last weekend after Trump ramped up his rhetoric over the issue and protesters in Copenhagen and Nuuk took to the streets.\n\nAhead of the protests, Tønnesen and his team made a printed version of the hats to distribute to the crowd, turning the image into an overnight sensation.\n\nE-commerce tracking service JungleScout told Business Insider it has tracked a nearly 900% increase in search volume for the term \"Greenland\" over the past 30 days.\n\nTønnesen said he and his partners are keeping none of the profits from the hats, pledging to donate the money to Greenlandic charities.\n\n\"I have five minutes of fame where I can use this to help Greenland,\" he said. \"That's what it's all about.\"\n\nTrump said this week he has no intention of taking the territory by force and no longer intends to slap tariffs on European countries over the Greenland issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump also said an agreement would include \"total access\" for the US.\n\nTønnesen said he has several thousand more hats arriving in the next few days, including a design that says Greenland is \"Already Great.\"\n\nStill, he is aware that the window of public attention can be short.\n\n\"I had the possibility to speak out,\" he said. \"You have to do it when the train is running.\"",

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",
