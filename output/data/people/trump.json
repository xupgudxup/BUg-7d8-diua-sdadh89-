    "description": "Trump wasn't willing to honor the U.S. women's team, but Jack Hughes can make sure their accomplishment isn't forgotten.",
    "fullText": "Jack Hughes has an opportunity for another gold-medal-worthy moment, and this time, he won’t have to beat a world-class goaltender to make it happen.\n\nThe Devils star only needs to use his massive platform as the new face of American hockey to make sure the other U.S. Olympic champions in his sport aren’t forgotten for what they accomplished in Milan.\n\nHe needs to do what President Donald Trump couldn’t do, inexplicably, with his callous dismissal of the U.S. women’s team during a locker room phone call as the men celebrated their historic victory over Canada. Trump made a dumb joke about needing to invite the women to the White House for the State of the Union address, too, as if they deserved that honor less than the men.\n\n“I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team, you do know that,” Trump told the men’s team before adding that if he didn’t, “I do believe I probably would be impeached.”\n\nSeveral men gathered around the phone laughed, and while that sparked outrage, it feels unfair to hold that against them. This was a joyous atmosphere just moments after the signature victory of their careers. Let’s give them some grace for that initial reaction.\n\nWhat happens now, though, is on them. The U.S. women — surprise! — turned down Trump’s half-hearted invitation to the State of the Union address, while Hughes and 19 of his teammates were expected to be in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday night for the speech.\n\n“No matter what your views are, we’re super excited to go to the White House tomorrow and be a part of that,” Hughes told The Daily Mail.\n\nThat sentiment sounds nice, but in these divided times, it falls flat. From the moment the players invited FBI director Kash Patel into the locker room to awkwardly chug a beer as if he himself had scored the winning goal, the gold-medal moment went from a unifying time to something else that we can yell at each other about on social media. That’s just the reality of the world we’re living in now.\n\nOn one point, though, there should be universal agreement: The U.S. women’s team deserves as much attention and credit for their gold-medal victory over Canada as the men do. Hughes, whose mother, Ellen, is a player development consultant for the women’s team, should make sure he never misses an opportunity to talk about them in the same breath as he does his own team’s accomplishment.\n\nThis should come naturally. Hughes was asked in the chaos of his team’s overtime victory what his first thought was after he sent the puck past Canadian goaltender Jordan Binnington. He didn’t talk about how this goal would ensure his immortality in U.S. hockey, or how the next generation of American kids might be emulating him in their driveways or ice rinks.\n\n“Honestly, first thought was, ‘We just won. How do I get my gloves and helmet off?’” Hughes said. “And surprisingly enough, one of the first people I thought of was Megan Keller, who had the gold-medal goal the other night.”\n\nKeller isn’t some stranger. The players on the two U.S. teams became friendly in the athletes’ village, with Hughes and his brother, Quinn, in a group of men’s team players who attended the women’s gold-medal game. The two teams hung out in the cafeteria after their Closing Ceremony, packing their bags and reminiscing.\n\n“If you could see what we see from the inside, and the men and women sharing, you know, dorm rooms and halls and flex floors and the camaraderie and the synergy and the way the women cheered on the men and the way the men cheered on the women — that’s what it’s all about,\" Ellen Hughes told the Today Show. “And the other things they cannot control. They care about humanity. They care about unity and they care about the country.”\n\nClearly, Ellen Hughes has raised her kids the right way. In 2023, Jack voiced his unequivocal support for the Devils’ decision to hold a Pride Night when other teams were canceling their celebrations. The LGBTQ community cheered when Hughes declared, “There was never a thought to not do it.”\n\nHe can own this fraught moment in a similar fashion. That doesn’t mean challenging Trump or angering either side of the political divide. It means doing the right thing and using his platform to remind this country — and, yes, the president himself — that we have the two greatest hockey teams in the world.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will deliver the first official State of the Union address of his term on Tuesday, and there are a few things investors should be listening for that could move markets.\n\nThe State of the Union isn't typically a market-moving event, but uncertainty around Trump's tariff regime following the Supreme Court's ruling and ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran mean investors are looking for signals of what's next from the president.\n\n\"This is usually a non-market-moving event and shouldn't cause a ripple effect on Wall St., with the speech telegraphed with little surprise or fanfare. However, the one constant under President Trump is that we can predict the unpredictable,\" Freedom Capital Markets chief market strategist Jay Woods said ahead of Tuesday evening's address.\n\nThe remarks are expected to be highly watched, with a poll from Scripps News/Talker Research finding that two-thirds of Americans see this State of the Union address as more important than previous years.\n\nHere is what investors should be keeping on their radar during Trump's speech.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that the majority of Trump's tariffs are illegal, finding that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act doesn't justify the import duties.\n\nTrump doubled down, lifting global tariffs to 15% using alternative frameworks to justify his trade war.\n\nLegal battles around tariffs are expected to continue, leaving investors without a clear picture of what's to come. In particular, the fight over tariff rebates for companies may just be getting started.\n\nAny comments from Trump about his trade plans could reshape Wall Street's expectations and move stocks.\n\n\"In his speech, we might learn more of his intent to continue to levy tariffs despite the SCOTUS decision,\" Woods said, adding that these comments could impact markets.\n\nOil prices have been volatile amid tensions between the US and Iran.\n\nWoods says that if Trump were to indicate an escalation of war against Iran, it could move markets.\n\nThe US has been building up its military presence in the Middle East. Updates from Trump about the US presence in Iran could add to volatility in the oil market, putting pressure on a key input for inflation.\n\nIt might be less of a market-moving update than tariffs or military action against Iran, but Trump is also expected to harp on the economy and his push to make life more affordable for everyday Americans.\n\nThe US economy has avoided what many feared would be the worst-case scenario under some of his policies, but worries persist.\n\nAlmost half of Americans are most interested in what Trump says about the economy, the Scripps News/Talker Research poll showed.\n\nComments from Trump about the economy could impact investor perception on inflation and the labor market, which could change expectations for the timing of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.",

    "fullText": "Some US presidents have more of the gift of the gab than others.\n\nThe American Presidency Project has tracked the length of every president's State of the Union address since 1964, with the timer beginning when the president opens with \"Mr. Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker.\"\n\nIn the State of the Union, which is mandated by the Constitution, presidents typically highlight their administration's accomplishments and lay out their legislative agenda in a speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nPresidents usually also introduce their legislative priorities in a joint address during their first year in office, a tradition started by President Ronald Reagan. Though this speech doesn't technically qualify as a State of the Union, it is widely regarded as such and is included in the American Presidency Project's dataset.\n\nOn average, State of the Union speeches from 1964 onwards have lasted 56 minutes and 24 seconds, according to the American Presidency Project. President Richard Nixon gave the shortest-ever State of the Union speech in 1972 at 28 minutes and 55 seconds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton have given eight of the top 10 longest State of the Union speeches in history. In 2025, Trump broke Clinton's record when his joint address to Congress clocked in at 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 32 seconds.\n\nIt's a record Trump could break again when he delivers the State of the Union on February 24 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nHere's how the top 10 longest State of the Union addresses stack up.",

They are shifting millions of dollars into defensive positions and speculative bets.\n\nThis urgent movement follows a series of shocks that have left the global financial system on edge.\n\nThe market tension traces back to a major legal blow delivered last week on Feb. 20.\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the US Supreme Court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority when he used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote:\n\n“We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.”\n\nTrump first launched the tariff wave on April 2, 2025, a day he branded “Liberation Day.” His administration argued that persistent US trade deficits constituted a national emergency, allowing him to bypass Congress under IEEPA.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling specifically invalidated tariffs imposed under IEEPA but left intact sector-based tariffs enacted under other trade laws.\n\nTrump called the decision “deeply disappointing” and insisted the Court had only limited one legal pathway. In a TruthSocial post, he wrote:\n\n“As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!”\n\nWithin hours, Trump signed a proclamation invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose a new 10% global tariff for up to 150 days, later stating he would raise it to 15%.\n\nMajor gold giant shrinks as Trump-linked firm surges\n\nRich Dad Poor Dad buys Bitcoin again\n\nViral AI agent bans ‘Bitcoin,' ‘crypto’ mentions\n\nUS stock futures turned lower, with S&P 500 futures down roughly 0.8% and Nasdaq futures off about 1% following the renewed tariff push.

It found that 89% of Democrats, 30% of Republicans, and 64% of independents believe that the president is becoming “erratic with age.” Taken altogether, 61% of respondents described Trump that way.  Forty-five percent, meanwhile, still believe that he “is mentally sharp and able to deal with challenges.” Forty-nine percent say he is not.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of respondents indicated that “elected officials in Washington, D.C.” more generally “are too old to represent most Americans.”\n\nTrump’s approval rating ticked up two points to 40% and net approval rating went up by four points to -18%. The former number had  stood pat at 38% in the previous two Reuters/Ipsos polls, which were conducted in mid-February and late January, when his net approval rating came in at -22% and -21%, respectively.\n\nThe president’s approval rating has slipped with among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics since February of last year, but most precipitously with that last group, from 36% to 29%. His economic approval rating has also taken a notable dip over that timeframe, from 41% to 36%.\n\nThe post Most Americans — Including 30% of Republicans — Believe Trump Is Becoming ‘Erratic With Age’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Mortgage rates dipped below a key threshold this week. That could be a boon for Donald Trump's affordability push, but it's not necessarily for the reason the president wants.\n\nThe average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage in the US dropped to 5.99% on Monday, per the Mortgage News Daily Rate Index. That's the lowest borrowing costs have been for prospective home buyers since 2022. The decline has been driven by the latest decrease in Treasury yields.\n\nHowever, rather than pricing in lower rates in the medium-term, which is what Trump wants to see, government bond yields have dropped because investors are freaked out again about the trade war.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury declined in the days since the Supreme Court struck down most of Trump's tariffs, dropping five basis points on Monday alone.\n\nThe president's response to the ruling that he would initiate a new global tariff of 15% has reignited investors' fears about the trade war.\n\nThough most of Trump's tariffs have been struck down, the prospect of a 15% universal tariff, combined with the sell-off in tech driven by AI in recent weeks, has caused investors to flee to safety.\n\nJPMorgan said on Monday that the risk-off move has caused yields to spike. Investors are grasping for safe havens amid a new cocktail of market worries, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, told Business Insider, pointing to the concurrent rise in hedges like gold. The metal is up about 4% in the last five days.\n\nThe 10-year yield has plummeted to its lowest levels so far this year, and now looks \"very close\" to its low in April 2025, around the time Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sparked investor panic and a historical sell-off, according to Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research.\n\n\"We are, in other words, in pretty unusual territory,\" Colas wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The Mac Mini is having a moment thanks to the OpenClaw AI agent. And, in a new development, AI enthusiasts in America can now expect a made-in-the-USA version of Apple's small computer.\n\nThe tech giant announced Tuesday that it would be significantly expanding its factory operations to bring some production of the Mac Mini to the US for the first time. Beginning later this year, Mac Mini units will be produced at a new factory at Apple's existing Houston manufacturing site to help fulfill US orders.\n\nThe company said it will also expand advanced its AI server manufacturing at the Houston factory, an effort that it expects to create thousands of job. It's in line with Apple's previous commitment to invest $600 billion into its US facilities and create 20,000 jobs over the next four years.\n\n\"Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we're proud to significantly expand our footprint in Houston with the production of Mac Mini starting later this year,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThere's been some hype around the Mac Mini in 2026, as people seek to operate OpenClaw, an open-source autonomous AI agent. The buzzy AI project has renewed interest in the Mac Mini. It's currently produced in Asia, with many models being listed as Vietnam-made. Overseas production of the computer will continue.\n\nApple's 20,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center is under construction in Houston, and it will be a site where students, supplier employees, and American businesses can receive hands-on training in the company's manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn its announcement, Apple shouted out several milestones its hit since its $600 billion pledge, including sourcing more that 20 billion US-made chips across 12 states, opening its Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, and being on track to purchase more than 100 million advanced chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company at its Arizona facility.\n\nThe Mac Mini announcement is the latest example of Apple leaning into made-in-the-USA messaging and efforts, as Cook navigates a political balancing act in his relationship with President Donald Trump. As a consumer electronics company that sources much of production overseas, Trump's trade tariffs have cost Apple billions in costs in recent quarters. The tech giant has made tweaks to its supply chain, shifting much of the production of US-bound iPhones to India, for example, as part of its efforts to mitigate the tariff impact.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S.",
    "fullText": "Feb 24 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has excoriated the U.S. Supreme Court's decision striking down his sweeping tariffs, is expected to come face-to-face with at least some of the justices when he delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nThe annual address, which has created uncomfortable moments for Supreme Court justices in the past, ‌could highlight the tensions between Trump and the three conservative justices who joined its three liberal members in the 6-3 ruling on Friday: Chief Justice John Roberts, Neil Gorsuch and Amy ‌Coney Barrett.\n\nThe Republican president appointed Gorsuch in 2017 and Barrett in 2020 during his first term in office. Roberts has served as chief justice for more than two decades since being appointed by Republican former President George W. Bush in 2005.\n\nAfter the ruling was ​issued on Friday, Trump denounced the court and the six justices who ruled against him. The court in the decision found that Trump had exceeded his powers by bypassing Congress and imposing the tariffs under a U.S. law meant for use in national emergencies.\n\nTrump said he was \"ashamed\" of the three conservative justices who ruled against him, calling them \"fools and lapdogs for the RINOs and the radical-left Democrats.\" RINO, meaning \"Republican in name only,\" is a term sometimes used by conservative Republicans to insult fellow Republicans viewed as disloyal to the party.\n\nGorsuch and Barrett, Trump said, were \"an embarrassment to their families\" for ruling against him on tariffs. Trump also alleged, without providing evidence, ‌that the court has been \"swayed by foreign interests.\"\n\nTrump, though, lauded the three ⁠justices who ruled in his favor, with high praise in particular for his 2018 appointee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nSupreme Court justices often attend the State of the Union address, and some of the current nine are expected to be present inside the U.S. House of Representatives chamber for Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress. The ⁠court has not yet said which justices will attend on Tuesday.\n\nCustomarily, justices who attend wear their judicial robes and typically sit expressionless.\n\nThe attendance of the justices \"sends a message of stability\" and \"conveys that these aren't enemy institutions,\" Brown University political science professor Corey Brettschneider said.\n\nIn an address to Congress last year, Trump clasped Roberts by the hand, patted him on the shoulder, and told him: \"Thank you again. I won't forget.\"\n\nThe remark came in the aftermath of a 2024 Supreme Court ​decision ​authored by Roberts granting Trump, who had faced criminal charges while out of office, broad immunity from prosecution for ​official acts as president. Trump later said he was thanking Roberts for swearing him ‌at his inauguration.\n\nFour justices attended Trump's last formal State of the Union in 2020.\n\nRoberts has attended every State of the Union address since joining the Supreme Court, even though he has publicly questioned why he bothers.\n\n\"The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering, while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think is very troubling,\" Roberts said during a 2010 speech at the University of Alabama, according to media reports.\n\n\"To the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally,\" Roberts added, \"I'm not sure why we're there.\"\n\nRoberts made those remarks after Democratic President Barack Obama during his State of the Union address criticized a Supreme Court ruling striking down certain campaign finance limits, saying it would \"open the floodgates\" ‌to unlimited corporate and potentially foreign money in U.S. elections.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito, present for the speech, reacted by ​shaking his head and appearing to mouth \"not true,\" a departure from the traditionally impassive demeanor of the justices.\n\nAlito has shunned the ​State of the Union ever since, calling it a \"very awkward\" tradition.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with the ​American Spectator, a conservative news outlet, Alito indicated that justices may be placed in a difficult position attending State of the Union addresses.\n\n\"Every once in a while the ‌president will say something that is nonpartisan,\" Alito said. \"We look foolish sitting there, ​so we stand up and start to applaud. And ​then we'll get faked out. The president will get say, 'This is a great country' - and everyone will stand up and start to applaud - 'because we're gonna do this, we're gonna enact this legislation.' It's a very odd experience.\"\n\nThe late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia also had a policy of skipping the speech, which he once called a \"childish spectacle.\"\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden during his 2024 State of the ​Union address looked directly at the justices who were present and admonished ‌them over the court's 2022 ruling that rolled back abortion rights.\n\n\"With all due respect, justices, women are not without ... electoral or political power,\" Biden said.\n\nThe last time all nine members ​of the court missed a State of the Union address was in 2000, near the end of Democratic President Bill Clinton's second term. The court, in a public statement ​at the time, attributed the absences to \"travel changes and minor illnesses.\"",

    "description": "Nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers are in default, and another one in four borrowers is behind on payments, a new report said.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers are falling behind on payments at record levels.\n\nA new report by left-leaning groups, the Century Foundation and Protect Borrowers, found that nearly 9 million student-loan borrowers — or one out of every five — are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made a payment for more than 270 days.\n\nAdditionally, the report said that one in four borrowers with a payment due is in delinquency, meaning they're behind on payments, and those borrowers have seen their credit scores decrease by 57 points on average over the first three quarters of 2025. A drop in credit can cause borrowers to lose access to various forms of credit or loans, making it difficult to afford basic necessities, the report said.\n\nThis data follows President Donald Trump's restart of collections for defaulted borrowers in May 2025 after a five-year pause. While the Department of Education announced in January that it was pausing wage garnishments and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers, it's unclear when the pause will lift, and more borrowers could be at risk of facing those consequences.\n\nThe report said that the pause is \"welcome\" but \"puts a band-aid on a serious wound.\"\n\n\"Considering the nation's worsening affordability crisis and unprecedented number of borrowers entering default, resuming garnishments would be cruel and economically reckless,\" the report said.\n\nEllen Keast, the Department of Education's press secretary for higher education, attributed the rise in delinquency and defaults to various relief measures that the Biden administration put in place, including the \"on-ramp\" to repayment, during which the department did not report any missed payments to credit agencies.\n\n\"The idea of a sudden increase in delinquencies in student loans is a misnomer — the Trump Administration is once again reporting full and accurate data on student loan repayment instead of extending so-called flexibilities related to a pandemic that ended five years ago,\" Keast said. She added that the department \"will continue to support regular, on-time repayment.\"\n\nThe Department of Education released guidance on February 18, urging institutions to reduce student default rates. The guidance included updated nonpayment rates, which are the percentage of borrowers who entered repayment between January 2020 and May 2024 with federal student loans more than 90 days delinquent. Over 1800 institutions have nonpayment rates at or above 25%, the guidance said.\n\n\"Student borrowers have an obligation to repay their loans, but institutions also share a responsibility to ensure their students are prepared to enter repayment and understand the consequences of nonpayment,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. \"Institutions cannot benefit from taxpayer dollars while ignoring the fact that a significant share of their students are not well-prepared to repay their loans.\"\n\nThe department's looming repayment changes could make things more difficult for some borrowers. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with less generous options, meaning borrowers will face longer timelines to loan forgiveness and likely higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department also announced a settlement to eliminate Biden's SAVE plan, which would have allowed for cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to relief. The report said that SAVE borrowers are \"more financially fragile than the average borrower,\" citing data from the Biden administration showing that more than half of them qualified for $0 monthly payments, putting them at greater risk of delinquency and default.\n\nStudent loan borrowers have a few options to get out of default. One option is loan rehabilitation, in which a borrower must contact their servicer and enter an agreement to make nine payments over 10 consecutive months. While wage and benefits garnishment will continue during this time, the default status will be removed from the borrower's credit report once rehabilitation is complete.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation, in which a borrower can apply to consolidate a defaulted student loan into a federal consolidation loan. After consolidation, the borrower would become eligible for federal benefits, but the default status would remain on the borrower's credit history.",

    "fullText": "President Trump’s top mouthpiece has flipped out over criticism leveled at “Keystone” Kash Patel after the FBI director was busted celebrating with a U.S. Olympic team on the taxpayers’ dime.\n\nPatel, who, on becoming FBI director, said resources would go solely toward fighting crime, was pictured celebrating in Italy with Team USA after its overtime Olympic victory over Team Canada in the men’s hockey final.\n\nThe 45-year-old hockey buff mingled with the players while guzzling beers and beating his chest as if he were part of the team. He even commandeered a gold medal at one point, looping it around his neck. The fallout was spectacular, with many wondering why the embattled crime chief was in party mode while his bureau struggles to find the missing mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nThere were also concerns about the nature of the foreign jaunt, given that Patel’s office had insisted it was “strictly” business, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carol Leonnig.\n\nShe provoked the ire of White House communications director Steven Cheung by posting about the saga on X. “Yes - Multiple sources have sent me and @KDilanianMSNOW this video *appearing to show* @FBIDirectorKash Patel guzzling from a beer and partying in locker room w US men’s hockey team. His office insisted this was strictly a business trip. We at @MSNOWNews will share what we learn,\" she wrote on Sunday evening.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday, a bristling Cheung replied. “Carol, you’re either mentally deficient or a liar,” he began.\n\n“This ‘exclusive’ video your ‘sources’ sent you is actually from a publicly available Instagram story. Second, Kash was also in Italy meeting with regional partners and security teams. Third, don’t be mad because America won,” he told the American journalist.\n\nThe video comes at a time when the FBI is struggling to locate 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, mother of Today host Savannah Guthrie, after her abduction earlier this month. Apparently work-shy Patel, nicknamed Keystone Kash for his ham-fisted efforts as head of the bureau, also has a growing crisis in Mexico to consider.\n\nA military operation that resulted in the death of the head of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the world’s most-wanted drug traffickers, has sparked chaos on the streets of many places popular with tourists, including Americans.\n\nAs a result, Americans in affected areas have been ordered to shelter in place due to safety concerns. “Due to ongoing, widespread security operations and related road blockages and criminal activity in many areas of Mexico, U.S. citizens should shelter in place until further notice,” the State Department announced on Sunday.\n\nPatel also posted on X while watching the Team USA game from a box inside Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe post came after an armed man was shot and killed when he entered the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s residence in Florida.",

    "description": "Critics worry about what forgiveness and repayment options borrowers may have if federal student loans are sold to private lenders.",
    "fullText": "The Education Department said it has not made a final decision on selling off federal student loans.\n\nIt's the first time the administration has publicly acknowledged that a sale to private companies is under consideration.\n\nIt comes as private lenders prepare for an influx of borrowers amid looming repayment changes.\n\nThe future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhen asked for additional detail on a potential sale, Ellen Keast, the press secretary for higher education, told Business Insider that \"we continue to evaluate and implement strategies to strengthen the fiscal integrity of the nearly $1.7 trillion portfolio and safeguard the interests of both students and taxpayers.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.",

    "fullText": "Hundreds of Christian leaders and scholars nationwide are denouncing President Donald Trump’s administration and urging more active resistance among the faithful to “the injustices and anti-democratic danger sweeping across the nation.”\n\n“We are facing a cruel and oppressive government,” their collective statement begins. “In moments like this, silence is not neutrality — it is an active choice to permit harm.”\n\nTitled “A Call to Christians in a Crisis of Faith and Democracy,” the letter says the nation is facing a profound moral, spiritual, and democratic emergency. Its release coincides with the start of the Christian season of Lent, a period of repentance, self-reflection and resistance to temptation.\n\n“We thought it was important to tie into a season where many Christians go deeper into their faith,” said Adam Russell Taylor, president of Sojourners, a Christian social justice organization. “Part of what we’re critiquing is the way in which many White evangelical Christians succumb to an unconditional support of the administration, despite the fact that its actions are completely antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.”\n\nLeaders of all faiths have increasingly spoken out and participated in protests against the policies of the Trump administration, particularly aimed at what many see as overly aggressive efforts to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. Pastors have been arrested and struck with pepper balls during demonstrations.\n\nThe statement says Christians have a moral obligation to speak out against “citizens and immigrants being demonized, disappeared, and even killed; the erosion of hard-won rights and freedoms; and a calculated effort to reverse America’s growing racial and ethnic diversity – all of which are pushing us toward authoritarian and imperial rule.”\n\n“This moment is a defining test of Christian discipleship and civic responsibility,” said the Rev. Jim Wallis, founder and director of the Georgetown Center for Faith and Justice in Washington, D.C.. “Democratic freedoms are being taken away and the gospel is being distorted. The vulnerable people Jesus told us to stand with and defend are being targeted and assaulted.”\n\nWallis and Taylor organized the collective effort along with Barbara Williams-Skinner, president of Baltimore’s Skinner Institute, a faith leadership development organization.\n\nAbout 400 people initially signed the statement, representing a range of Christian denominations, leaders of Black, Asian and Latino churches and associations and Christian universities and institutions. Hundreds more have added their names since the letter’s Feb. 18 release, organizers say.\n\nThe Executive Office of the President of the United States, which includes the White House office, did not respond to a request for comment about the statement.\n\nThe Christian leaders and scholars say aside from the risks to democracy, they are troubled by “a Christian faith corrupted by the heretical ideology of white Christian nationalism.”\n\n“People look at it as just a democratic crisis, but it’s not,” said the Rev. Cynthia Hale, pastor of Ray of Hope Christian Church in Decatur, Georgia, who was among those who signed the letter. “It’s a crisis of faith.”\n\nChristian nationalism, the idea that Christian people and biblical law should govern American life, has seeped into the highest levels of American government with conservative evangelicals becoming a major political force with strong support of Trump. Evangelical pastor Doug Wilson, who has said women should neither vote nor hold religious or political leadership positions, was recently invited by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to conduct a service at the Pentagon.\n\n“Their religious leaders have been so unconditionally supportive that it’s almost branded this administration as being religious in the minds of many Americans, which is a distortion,” said Bishop Raymond Rivera of the Council of Holistic Christian Churches and Ministries, who also signed the letter. “They’ve confused proximity to political power with proximity to the power of God. They’re not the same.”\n\nTaylor called such conflation “a form of idolatry” and said the Trump administration in turn has misused Christian language to support its activities, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruitment ads that quote scripture in their appeals – one ad, for instance, includes a verse saying “Blessed are the peacemakers.”\n\n“That feels particularly offensive and egregious in light of the tactics we’ve seen them employ in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and elsewhere,\" he said. \"It’s corrupting the Christian faith to advance its own political agenda.”\n\nKristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University, a Christian institution in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said she initially wondered before signing whether the moment required something more than signing yet another statement.\n\n“I realized this statement isn’t primarily for people who have been on the front lines of these issues but for pastors and ordinary Christians who may be just waking up to what’s happening and what’s at stake,” Du Mez said. “I think it’s important to offer a statement that clarifies the political and theological stakes and that people can put their name behind…. This is a way for ordinary Christians to step up.”\n\nThe letter concludes by tying a set of core theological convictions to actions the signers pledge to take to practice their faith and protect democracy, including defending voting rights, pursuing peace and standing with unjustly targeted immigrants.\n\nDottie Escobedo-Frank, bishop of the United Methodist Church’s California-Pacific Conference in Pasadena, said she signed the letter to encourage her Southern California community and all Christians to live out their callings to serve the downtrodden, demonstrate compassion and challenge political leaders to act on their behalf.\n\nHowever, with church ministries offering food distribution, childcare or elderly assistance having faced disruption from ICE agents or anti-immigrant demonstrators, “we’re seeing people in our communities who are afraid to live out their faith because of the actions of our government,” she said.\n\nTaylor understands many may be justifiably fearful of living out their creed but said it’s critical for people to engage at a time when “the pages of the authoritarian playbook are very much in effect,” he said.\n\nHe said one way to overcome such fears, aside from leaning into the resilience of faith itself, is to connect with other Christians. The letter effort includes a website where supporters can find ways to get involved.\n\n“One of the most consistent refrains in scripture is ‘do not be afraid,’” Taylor said. “Authoritarian governments thrive on people feeling isolated and overwhelmed, so we’re trying to create a network of solidarity and courage. We have the power to prevent things from getting worse.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Christian leaders say silence no longer option amid 'crisis of faith'",

    "description": "It came just days after Cooper announced he was leaving CBS show.",
    "fullText": "Anderson Cooper debunked President Donald Trump‘s claims of a “genocide” of white South African farmers on Sunday’s (February 22) edition of 60 Minutes.\n\nThe report, which The Daily Beast says was previously delayed by new CBS News boss Bari Weiss and subjected to an “abnormal” editing process, aired on Sunday’s show and saw Cooper traveling to South Africa to investigate Trump’s claims.\n\nIn the segment, Cooper played a clip of the president speaking to reporters in May 2025, in which he said, “It’s a genocide that’s taking place that you people don’t want to write about. It’s a terrible thing that’s taking place and farmers are being killed. They happen to be white.”\n\nTrump repeated these claims a week later when South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House. The president showed Ramaphosa video “proof” of what he said were “Burial sites. Over 1,000… of white farmers.” The video featured a row lined with several white crosses.\n\nCooper spoke with the man who erected those crosses, Darrel Brown, who said, “It definitely wasn’t a burial site. I mean those crosses were there for less than 48 hours. It was purely an avenue of crosses we planted there in honor of commercial farmers in South Africa that had lost their lives.”\n\nBrown, who keeps the crosses in a shed, said he put the crosses back up in 2024 for the funeral of his best friend, Tollie Nel, who was murdered on his farm.\n\nCooper also spoke with Tollie’s widow, Rene Nel, and asked her whether she would consider what is happening on South African farms to be a “genocide.”\n\n“Not what I know as a genocide,” she said. “Not what I’ve heard of what a genocide is. I see our attack as an opportunistic attack. They knew there was money. They knew there were firearms.”\n\nJohann Kotzé, the head of South Africa’s largest agricultural organization, also denied Trump’s claims. “It’s actually not about white genocide,” he stated. “It’s about criminality in South Africa. It’s crime. The fact that it happened on a farm doesn’t make me special as a farmer. It’s horrendous. Any murder is horrendous.”\n\nThe report comes just days after Cooper announced he will be leaving 60 Minutes at the end of the current broadcast season. He will continue to host Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN.\n\n60 Minutes, Sundays, 7/6 c, CBS\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "description": "The CBO estimates that benefit reductions would start at 8% in 2040 and steadily climb to a 10% cut by 2056.",
    "fullText": "Recent policy changes and economic shifts have slashed 12 years off the projected life span of the trust fund that pays for Medicare Part A, according to a newly updated report from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now slated to be entirely exhausted by 2040, even though the balance generally increases through 2031, as spending will begin to outstrip income in the following year.\n\nThis rapid deterioration of Medicare’s financial solvency represents a stark drop from the CBO’s previous estimate, which was published just last year, in March 2025. The dramatically shortened timeline means future retirees could face significant cuts to vital health care services far sooner than previously anticipated. As required by the Deficit Control Act, CBO Director Phillip Swagel noted the projections reflect the assumption benefits would be paid as scheduled even after the HI trust fund was exhausted.\n\nThe primary culprit for this accelerated depletion is a sharp reduction in the fund’s projected income, heavily driven by legislation passed over the last year. Specifically, the 2025 reconciliation act (Public Law 119-21, more commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act) significantly reduced the revenues the trust fund normally receives from taxing Social Security benefits. This legislation lowered tax rates and established a temporary deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older. Consequently, this major policy shift enacted during the Trump administration has directly contributed to starving the Medicare safety net of critical future funding.\n\nThe HI trust fund is the financial backbone for Medicare Part A, which covers essential services including inpatient hospital care, stays in skilled nursing facilities, home health care, and hospice care. Over the next 30 years, the fund is expected to rely on the Medicare payroll tax for about three-quarters of its annual income, with another roughly one-eighth derived from income taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nHowever, the recent tax cuts are not the only factor draining the fund. The CBO also cited decreased projections for payroll tax revenues, warning it had to adjust their models to account for lower expected worker earnings. Furthermore, because the trust fund will have smaller balances going forward, it will generate less interest income, creating a compounding negative effect on its overall finances.\n\nOn the other side of the ledger, Medicare spending is rising faster than anticipated. The CBO noted per-enrollee spending in Medicare Part A’s fee-for-service program in 2025, along with 2026 bids by Medicare Advantage plan providers, both came in higher than expected.",

    "title": "Poor judgment or a principled stand? Susan Rice's spat with Trump dissected",
    "description": "Governance watchers say Susan Rice's critique of Donald Trump is complicating Netflix's bid for Warner Bros., while others call her stance principled.",
    "fullText": "A corporate board seat can bring status and stock awards — and also political heat.\n\nThe criticism that Netflix board member Susan Rice leveled at President Donald Trump last week is dividing governance watchers over how political a corporate director can afford to be.\n\nRice, who served in top roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, made several critical remarks about the commander in chief during an appearance on the podcast \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara.\" Trump responded by demanding that Netflix remove her from her seat \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nThe spat has come at a precarious time for the video-streaming company. Netflix's pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery— an $82.7 billion bid — could reshape Hollywood, but it requires approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nWhile Rice's actions didn't break any laws, governance experts who spoke with Business Insider were split over whether she crossed a line.\n\nDirectors would be wise to keep their personal views about politics and other sensitive topics out of the public eye, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Their fiduciary responsibility is to serve in the company's best interests, and Rice's remarks ran counter to that duty, he said.\n\n\"It's poor judgment. And you're elected as a director for your judgment,\" Elson said. \"She has to ask herself, 'Am I a public figure or am I a corporate director?'\"\n\nElson, himself a director, said he avoids publicly staking out political positions. \"I just don't think it's in my lane,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat of retaliation, however, didn't align with the kind of conduct normally expected of a sitting president, either, said Jo-Ellen Pozner, a management and entrepreneurship professor at Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business.\n\n\"It's really important to recognize that what Susan Rice was calling out is exactly the behavior that Trump responded with,\" she said. \"Trump's reaction just points out how important what she has to say is.\"\n\nRice spoke critically of Trump at length on the podcast, suggesting her remarks were intentional rather than off the cuff.\n\n\"This might have felt like the hill that she was ready to die on, metaphorically,\" added Pozner. \"It's definitely risky for her politically. It's definitely risky for the Netflix deal, but it also seems like such a principled stance that it ought to be respected by most people.\"\n\nRice, Netflix, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIt is possible that Rice warned Netflix's leadership about the podcast and got its blessing behind the scenes. Ted Sarandos, the company's co-CEO, referred to its bid for Warner Bros. as a \"business deal\" on the BBC's Today program on Monday. \"It's not a political deal,\" he said.\n\nStill, Rice's public and partisan tongue-lashing is unusual for a director on a major corporate board. It could make companies reconsider whether to put political figures on their boards, Elson said.\n\n\"Obviously, someone coming out of public service has a lot of experience, a lot of intelligence,\" said Elson. But, he added, \"Are you retired or not?\"\n\nThe incident could further discourage corporate leaders from speaking their minds in public, said Pozner. The president has repeatedly targeted critics, publicly calling for boycotts of companies and attacking business figures who challenge him.\n\n\"I think it will have a dampening effect on public speech,\" said Pozner.\n\nGovernance experts say the incident should serve as a case study for corporate boardrooms.\n\n\"Every company in America that has a pending regulatory approval should be watching the case,\" said Bradley Akubuiro, a partner at leadership advisory firm Bully Pulpit International.\n\n\"The lesson isn't: Don't have political opinions. The lesson is: Understand when your company is at peak vulnerability and govern that accordingly. … Time really does matter.\"\n\nCompanies may be able to prevent directors from causing a similar kerfuffle, said Akubuiro, by enacting quiet periods during sensitive moments. These would be similar to how leaders are expected to clam up in the weeks leading up to companies' quarterly earnings reports.\n\n\"You just want to recognize that in a politicized moment, anything that's quasi-political can become a weapon, and folks will use that against you for maximum leverage,\" Akubuiro said.\n\nSimilarly, companies need defined communication policies that set expectations for directors, especially when regulatory stakes are high, and outline what to do if a board member goes off script, said Jennifer Schielke, CEO of the staffing firm Summit Group Solutions.\n\n\"The boardroom should be designed for robust dissent that is productive and private,\" she said.\n\nIn a fractious political environment, it's prudent for board members to get counsel and to consider the potential costs and benefits of what they say, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nYet, she added, \"That is completely different from being cowed into not saying anything.\"\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "The Supreme Court blocked a significant chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday. But instead of closing the chapter, it's opened an entirely new book that no one seems to understand.\n\nReturn of the tariffs. Despite the setback, the president isn't backing down. This weekend, he announced plans to impose a 15% \"worldwide\" tariff. That's thanks to Section 122, which allows him to briefly implement tariffs broadly. However, they can only remain in place for up to 150 days. Ultimately, he'll likely need to work with Congress for something more permanent.\n\nThe refund issue. One of the biggest questions is what happens to the $133 billion in taxes collected from the struck-down tariffs. More than a thousand companies preemptively filed lawsuits to claw back that money.\n\nThe process isn't as simple as the US government cutting a check. It's bound to get messy and involve lots of lawyers. Companies will also need to weigh the benefits of fighting for a refund against the risks of angering the current administration.\n\nSome Democrats are calling on the administration to issue $1,700 refunds directly to Americans. Shoppers shouldn't expect the ruling to mean prices are coming down soon, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nMarket reaction. It's a double-edged sword for investors. The ruling is likely to set a legal precedent that'll make it harder for the administration to impose larger tariffs than before. That's good for most businesses. Companies hit with tariffs could also get refunds, which would serve as a nice cash infusion.\n\nOn the other hand, lowering tariffs and the revenue they generate puts the spotlight firmly on the federal government's growing pile of debt. That could push bond yields higher and weigh on stocks.\n\nJefferies mapped out some consumer stocks that could benefit.\n\nThe broader economic impact. Since tariffs will remain in some form, it's tough to make a definitive statement. However, the most recent data from the past year shows a clear trend: The economy is growing, but not everyone is benefiting.\n\nIt's worth considering that a lot of the dire economic predictions people had about Trump's policies haven't materialized. A think tank offered reasons that's the case.\n\nSo who comes out on top? Even with so much still up in the air, we identified some potential winners and losers from the latest shake-up. (Hint: Lawyers are going to be just fine.) Meanwhile, many COOs are likely pulling out their hair from the tariff whiplash affecting their supply chains.\n\nWe'll get more clarity on Tuesday night during Trump's first State of the Union of his second term. Just don't expect a warm welcome for some of the Supreme Court justices.",

    "fullText": "The head of Netflix has responded publicly for the first time to President Donald Trump's calls for it to remove Susan Rice from its board.\n\n\"This is a business deal. It's not a political deal,\" Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, told the BBC's Today program on Monday, referring to the company's bid to buy Warner Bros. \"This deal is run by the Department of Justice in the US, and regulators throughout Europe and around the world.\"\n\nIn a Saturday Truth Social post, Trump called on Netflix to fire Rice, a former US ambassador and national security advisor in the Obama and Biden administrations, from its board of directors.\n\nTrump was responding to comments Rice made in a podcast about corporations that \"take a knee to Trump,\" warning that they could face retribution from a future Democratic administration.\n\nWhen asked by the BBC how big a deal it was for the president to weigh in on Rice, Sarandos said: \"He likes to do a lot of things on social media.\"\n\nIt comes at a delicate time for Netflix, which is battling Paramount to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. A deal would require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump had said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal. But that changed over the weekend, with the president writing that Netflix should remove Rice from its board \"or pay the consequences.\"\n\nBusiness Insider's Peter Kafka called Trump's demands an \"extraordinary use of power\" and said it's a reminder that the White House would be involved in the future of Warner Bros., regardless of what Trump is saying at any given moment.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sarandos said his pitch to Trump for Netflix's Warner Bros. bid is \"growth in the economy.\"\n\nHe said that Netflix's deal is a \"vertical merger\" in which the company is buying assets it doesn't already have, and so it will be \"adding to the market.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is seeking to buy Warner Bros. streaming and studio assets, Paramount is looking to buy all of the company.\n\nThe board of Warner Bros. Discovery earlier gave Paramount a seven-day window to submit a new offer, which expires at the end of Monday.\n\nOn February 17, WBD told shareholders that \"a senior representative\" from Paramount said the company would pay at least $31 per share for WBD, and that the bid wasn't the company's \"best and final\" proposal. The company's previous bid in December was for $30 per share.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's trade war has entered a new, chaotic chapter that's raised uncertainty for investors.\n\nMarkets are going through a fresh bout of volatility after the Supreme Court struck down the majority of Trump's tariffs — a move that seems to have marked the start of a new, confusing chapter in the trade saga.\n\nUS stocks initially rose after the tariff ruling was announced on Friday, even as Trump threatened to impose a fresh 10% global tariff. Indexes tumbled on Monday, however, as traders reacted to Trump's follow-up announcement that he would hike global tariffs to 15%, adding to the mayhem.\n\nUncertainty over tariffs has long hung over the market, and it's unclear how the new changes to tariffs will play out, particularly since it's unclear how the fight over tariff refunds might end, according to Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"I just don't think we've removed much of the uncertainty around tariffs by the Supreme Court ruling and quick pivot to Plan B,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I think that remains a headwind.\"\n\nHere's how market pros think investors should position as the trade war takes its latest turn.\n\nThe tariffs story is largely a distraction from the market's overarching focus on AI, according to Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research.\n\n\"I think the tariffs have become a bit of a sideshow at this point,\" Berezin said. \"I think it's really just an AI story at this point for the market.\"\n\nBerezin said Trump is unlikely to raise tariffs beyond what he announced on Saturday. The president also looks like he's laser-focused on his affordability push ahead of he midterm elections.\n\nFurthermore, Trump likely knows that tariffs are inflationary and is looking to avoid that, as much as members of his team have downplayed price increases from tariffs, Berezin said. He pointed to a recent Financial Times report that Trump was planning to roll back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, which the White House later denied.\n\nHogan said he thinks the recent tariff ruling doesn't change the status quo in markets. Even with Trump's 15% global tariff, the US's new trade policy doesn't look like it will change the investing landscape much from before, he said.\n\nSome nations, like China and Brazil, were facing much larger tariffs prior to the Supreme Court ruling, and have come out as \"winners\" under the new tariff scheme, Berezin said, though he didn't believe it changed the investing outlook from a sectoral perspective.\n\nHogan advised investors to stick to sectors that have recently outperformed after lagging the broader market for several years, including materials, industrials, and energy stocks. Those areas have made up the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 so far this year.\n\nBest-performing sectors of the S&P 500, year-to-date\n\nPrecious metals and commodities also look like they could become winners from the new trade chaos, according to David Morrison, a senior market strategist at Trade Nation. That's because investors flock to hard assets and other safe havens when they see \"tariff-driven market stress,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nDespite enduring a historic sell-off in late January, precious metals and commodities have also posted strong gains so far this year.\n\nHogan pointed to Friday's short-lived pop in shares of consumer-facing companies that are major importers of foreign goods, such as furniture and apparel retailers.\n\nSome investors may be feeling optimistic about corporate stimulus if the US refunds tariff payments. But refunds are uncertain, and should they come, it's likely that the government will drag out the process, Hogan said.\n\n\"I just don't know how resilient that will be in the face of ongoing litigation about the government paying this back,\" he added of the recent rebound in the consumer sector.\n\nJeff Buchbinder, the chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, added that the firm wouldn't chase stock jumps in import-heavy consumer retailers.\n\n\"We would fade the stock market bounce in tariff losers,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"Among tariff losers, our preference would be to play homebuilders, industrials, and technology hardware/semiconductors over apparel retailers and automakers.\"",

    "fullText": "The future ownership of the federal student-loan portfolio is up in the air.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren released a response she received in early February from Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent regarding the potential sale of federal student loans to private companies. Kent wrote in his letter that the administration has \"met with a variety of stakeholders to discuss ideas to reform the student loan portfolio\" with the goal of reducing the $1.7 trillion burden on borrowers.\n\n\"The Department has not taken any final actions or made final decisions regarding selling all or part of the student loan portfolio,\" Kent said. \"We continue to explore all viable options to reduce the burden on taxpayers by restoring the health of the portfolio.\"\n\nThis is the first time that the Department of Education has publicly acknowledged any discussions to sell off federal student loans. Politico first reported in October that the administration was discussing selling off federal student loans with finance executives.\n\nWhile it's unclear when, or if, a sale would occur, Warren and education policy experts have previously expressed concerns about handing student loan servicing over to private companies. Federal student loans tend to offer more generous forgiveness and repayment plans than private lenders, and it's unclear which plans borrowers would have access to should their loans be sold.\n\n\"Instead of helping Americans drowning with student loan debt, Trump is thinking up ways to make life worse for borrowers,\" Warren said in a statement. \"If the Trump administration cared about working-class families, it would stop its ridiculous plan to sell out families to Wall Street.\"\n\nWith major changes coming for student-loan repayment, private lenders are gearing up for a big year. Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees, and the leaders of major private lenders previously said they're preparing for an influx of borrowers seeking additional financing that the federal system would no longer cover.\n\nThose lenders wrote to Warren and some of her Democratic colleagues that they're equipped to handle the influx, but the lawmakers said they're concerned that \"lenders have far less of an incentive to provide borrowers with loans on terms that are commensurate to those of federal loans.\"\n\nKent maintained in his letter that the department is committed to improving federal student aid programs and helping borrowers pay back their loans.\n\n\"The Department remains focused on helping borrowers return to repayment and escape the albatross of delinquency and default,\" he wrote.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court faced criticism from President Donald Trump after striking his tariff agenda this week, as the president looks towards an upcoming ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court for striking most of his tariff agenda this week, going on to warn that a similar ruling against his birthright citizenship order would be a benefit to China.\n\nTrump made the statement in a post to his Truth Social account on Monday, clarifying that he was not frustrated with the \"Great Three,\" or the justices who sided with his administration in the tariff ruling. The Supreme Court is set to consider Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship in the coming months.\n\n\"The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Our incompetent supreme court did a great job for the wrong people, and for that they should be ashamed of themselves (but not the Great Three!). The next thing you know they will rule in favor of China and others, who are making an absolute fortune on Birthright Citizenship, by saying the 14th Amendment was NOT written to take care of the 'babies of slaves,' which it was as proven by the EXACT TIMING of its construction, filing, and ratification, which perfectly coincided with the END OF THE CIVIL WAR,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump Reveals His 'New Hero' Supreme Court Justice After Tariffs Ruling\n\n\"How much better can you do than that? But this supreme court will find a way to come to the wrong conclusion, one that again will make China, and various other Nations, happy and rich. Let our supreme court keep making decisions that are so bad and deleterious to the future of our Nation - I have a job to do,\" he added.\n\nTrump signed his birthright citizenship order on his first day back in office last year. The order seeks to end birthright citizenship for nearly all persons born in the U.S. to undocumented parents, or parents with lawful temporary status in the country — a seismic shift that critics note would break with some 150 years of legal precedent.\n\nTrump's order would reinterpret the 14th Amendment, which states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\" — a provision that administration officials argue has been misinterpreted.\n\nTrump's Tariff Revenues Hit Record Highs As Supreme Court Deals Major Blow\n\nThe language put forth by the Trump administration seeks to clarify that individuals born to illegal immigrant parents, or those who were here legally but on temporary non-immigrant visas, are not citizens by birthright.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling on the issue could have sweeping national implications for an issue Trump officials argue is a crucial component of his hard-line immigration agenda, which has become a defining feature of his second White House term.\n\nMeanwhile, opponents argue that the effort is an unconstitutional and \"unprecedented\" effort that would threaten some 150,000 children in the U.S. born annually to parents of non-citizens, and an estimated 4.4 million American-born children under 18 who are living with an illegal immigrant parent, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nFox News' Breanne Deppisch contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday permanently barred the release of special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into President Donald Trump’s hoarding of classified documents that led to charges once seen as the most perilous of the four criminal cases the Republican faced.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, granted a request from the president to keep under wraps the report on an investigation alleging Trump stored sensitive documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House following his first term and obstructed government efforts to get them back.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on the classified documents investigation and a separate probe into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Joe Biden. Both investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith’s team after Trump’s November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had already determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department, according to court papers. The Trump administration has characterized Smith's investigation as politically motivated and said in recent court papers that the report belongs in the “dustbin of history.\"\n\nCannon's order, however, blocking the release also applies to Bondi's successors at the Justice Department. Cannon, who in 2024 dismissed the case after concluding that Smith was unlawfully appointed after multiple other favorable rulings for Trump, said the release of the report would present a “manifest injustice” to the president and his two co-defendants.\n\n“Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges,” she wrote. “As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.”\n\nA First Amendment group and watchdog organization that have been pressing for the report's release could presumably continue to fight in higher courts for it become public.\n\n“Judge Cannon’s decision to permanently block the release of this extraordinarily significant report is impossible to square with the First Amendment and the common law,” said Scott Wilkens, senior counsel at The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, one of the groups pushing for the public release of the report. “There is no legitimate basis for its continued suppression.”\n\nCannon wrote that though it is true that special counsels have historically released reports at the conclusion of their work, they have done so either after electing not to bring charges in a particular case or “after adjudications of guilt by plea or trial.\" Though Cannon suggested that an adjudication of guilt typically precedes the release of a special counsel report, there have been instances in which defendants charged by a special counsel have been acquitted at trial and the allegations against them have nonetheless been subsequently rehashed in a publicly released report.\n\nThe classified documents case was once considered the most serious of the four criminal cases against him. It accused Trump of repeatedly enlisting aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showing off a Pentagon “plan of attack” and classified map.\n\nThe first volume of Smith’s report on Trump’s 2020 election interference case was released last year shortly before Trump returned to the White House. Smith has defended his decision to bring those charges, saying he believes they would have resulted in a conviction had voters not elected Trump in 2024.\n\nCannon last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with the classified documents case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified last month before the House Judiciary Committee.",

Unsurprisingly, the S&P 500 closed up 0.69% on Friday.\n\nBut after Trump said he would propose new tariffs of 10%, and then changed his mind and made it 15%, analysts began to realize that some of the things Trump might do next could be more extreme than his “Liberation Day” tariffs and will certainly be more complex.\n\nAs UBS’s Paul Donovan put it, “Welcome back uncertainty.”\n\nBNP analyst William Bratton published a research note summarizing Trump’s options. “Some of these could be highly punitive,” he said:\n\nSection 122 of the 1974 Trade Act is valid only for the next 150 days and must then be extended by Congress. It is not applicable to agricultural products, metals, minerals, chemicals, oil, gas, pharmaceuticals, aircraft, some electronics, and various automobiles.\n\nSection 301 tariffs “have no upper limit, have proved to be highly sticky once implemented (as with those imposed on China in 2018), and could, in theory, be applied to any country that does not agree to a trade agreement with the U.S. that embeds higher tariffs,” Bratton wrote.\n\nSection 232 tariffs also “have no upper limit and can be expanded in scope once implemented. Trump has already used this law to expand and raise the tariffs on multiple products—most notably on cars and car parts—and various Section 232 investigations are currently ongoing including into semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.”\n\nBratton argued that Asian companies will react by increasingly detaching themselves from U.S. trade. “We expect U.S. trade policy…to become increasingly complex and more targeted resulting in a patchwork of tariff measures and trade agreements…the global economy will continue to fragment with U.S. trade flows steadily becoming less important as Asian trade becomes increasingly more regional in nature,” he told clients.",

    "fullText": "UFC fighters with visa problems just learned something in Houston over the weekend: ask and ye shall receive.\n\nUros Medic won his co-main fight against Geoff Neal via violent first round knockout (watch it here) and then followed that up not with a request — not for a $100,000 bonus (which he got anyway) but for help with his immigration issues.\n\n“Now I got one little problem,” Medic declared in the cage. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. President, Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we gotta go to Belgrade, Serbia for the UFC this summer.”\n\nWe have our doubts the UFC will make the trip to Serbia any time soon, but Medic now can because UFC CEO Dana White got U.S. president Donald Trump on the phone to take care of his issues.\n\n“I’m back in his office and Dana’s got president Donald Trump on speaker phone,” Medic said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m just standing there and I cannot believe what’s happening. I’m talking to the president, and he said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. You can travel. Just give Dana documentation, the information that you need.'”\n\n“I’m just blown away. I mean, I love Mr. President, and his wife is from Slovenia, First Lady Melania … It was just amazing for me to be able to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him. And obviously, his wife, who is from where I’m from – or I’m considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country. It’s like a five-hour drive. That’s nothing for America. Like, you can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.”\n\n“So yeah, I’m still processing all of it.”\n\nThat’s great news for Medic, who has been unable to travel back to his home country for three years now. Between the knockout of the year candidate, his $100,000 bonus, and getting his visa fixed, it’s been a pretty good weekend for the Serbian fighter.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe president and his party appear vulnerable, with polls showing much of America distrusts how Trump has managed the government in his first year back in office. In addition, the Supreme Court last week struck down one of the chief levers of his economic and foreign policy by ruling he lacked the power to impose many of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThough Trump is expected to focus on domestic issues, his intensifying threats about launching military strikes on Iran over its nuclear program cast a shadow over the address.\n\nHere are a few things to watch as Trump tries to make his case:\n\nTrump swept back into the White House on promises to bring down prices and restore order to immigration in America. But on both issues, public sentiment has turned against him.\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership and just 38% support him on immigration, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Those low numbers show the country is still fretting about the costs of groceries, housing and utilities, a problem compounded by Trump's whipsawing use of tariffs. They also show how the public was disturbed by videos of violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.\n\nSince his party passed a massive tax cut bill last year, Trump has yet to unveil major new policy ideas on the economy. In recent speeches, he has largely offered the public reruns about his tax cuts, plans to reduce mortgage rates and a new government website for buying prescription drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling against many of Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday and the president vowing to use other means to forge ahead with import taxes will only prolong the economic turmoil over trade and prices.\n\n“I think it makes it even more important that the speech really focus on the economy,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.\n\nConant said between the tariff ruling and a Commerce Department report on Friday that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, \"the president needs to bolster his economic message.”\n\nThe administration is trying to make the case that despite Trump's rewiring of global trade and tax cuts, the economy is still struggling because of choices made in 2021 and 2022 by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. But Trump is also seeking to take credit for positive signs in the current economy, such as recent stock market gains.\n\n“Watch the State of the Union. We’re going to be talking about the economy. We inherited a mess,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Trump made the same kind of argument in his address to a joint session of Congress last year, invoking the Biden name 13 times.\n\nDespite Trump's America First credo, his aggressive approach abroad over the past year has sparked concerns among some of his supporters about whether he should spend more time focusing on voters at home.\n\nTrump, who's made it clear he covets a Nobel Peace Prize, is likely to use the speech to remind Americans of his attempts to try to broker peace accords in global conflicts.\n\nBut in many respects, the president hasn't been extending olive branches. Within the past year, his administration has launched strikes in Yemen, Nigeria and Iran, along with an ongoing campaign of lethal military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels near South America. Trump also shocked the world in January with a surprise raid to capture Venezuela's then-leader, Nicolás Maduro, and floated the idea of using force to seize Greenland.\n\nIn recent weeks, as he pressures Iran, Trump has bolstered the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East. But he has yet to make a clear case to voters about what his actions overseas mean for their lives.\n\nHe might even minimize foreign policy in his State of the Union despite his belief that it's been a major success.\n\n“For as much as foreign policy has dominated his last year in office, this speech will mostly focus on the economy,” Conant predicted.\n\nVice President JD Vance offered a similar prediction, saying in an interview Saturday on Fox News Channel that in the speech, “you’re going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back into our country, of reshoring manufacturing, of all these great factories that are being built.”\n\nHe said Trump would also speak about lowering energy costs.\n\nThe State of the Union used to be about recapping accomplishments and seeking to unite the country, but it increasingly reflects divisions in society.\n\n“What you’re going to expect is some version of a campaign speech in which the Democrats are the villains, the Republicans he likes are the heroes, and he is the savior not only of the nation but of the globe,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump supporters might cherish the moment in 2020 when the president midspeech reunited a military family. He also bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host and author who died in 2021. But that moment turned off Democrats who saw Limbaugh as a destructive figure in political media.\n\nTrump is delivering the speech, but his audience sitting in the House chamber has a big role, too. When Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi theatrically ripped up a copy of the speech afterward, overshadowing much of what Trump said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has said in a letter to colleagues “it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,” indicating some members might choose not to attend in protest to Trump. But there's also the possibility of Democrats razzing Trump as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, did in 2025, leading him to be removed from the chamber.\n\nIf Trump in his speech lays out a fuller case for why he's using other mechanisms in federal law to continue his tariffs, Conant said it'll be interesting to see the reaction from lawmakers.\n\n“I think that any House Republicans that don't applaud his tariffs are going to be featured prominently on the telecast,” he said.\n\nWhile some presidential phrases endure, much of the rhetoric in State of the Unions is forgettable. And with Trump — who's known for veering off-script — there's a good chance a stray comment or a social media post could step on his message.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former Republican speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, noted in an email that people hear the president talk all of the time, so the State of the Union has lost much of its luster.\n\nA State of the Union “only matters in moments when the country is undergoing a great trauma — a war, an attack, a global crisis — and a president and Congress want to speak in a (mostly) united voice to the country,” he said. “That’s not what we are experiencing now.”",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nSeven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.\n\nBarrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.\n\nBarrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.\n\nKushner was asked to attend a meeting at the foreign affairs ministry scheduled on Monday evening, according to diplomatic sources. He had already been summoned in August last year over his letter to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will stand before Congress on Tuesday to deliver the annual State of the Union address to a suddenly transformed nation.\n\nOne year back in office, Trump has emerged as a president defying conventional expectations. He has executed a head-spinning agenda, upending priorities at home, shattering alliances abroad and challenging the nation's foundational system of checks and balances. Two Americans were killed by federal agents while protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids and mass deportations.\n\nAs the lawmakers sit in the House chamber listening to Trump's agenda for the year ahead, the moment is an existential one for the Congress, which has essentially become sidelined by his expansive reach, the Republican president bypassing his slim GOP majority to amass enormous power for himself.\n\n“It’s crazy,\" said Nancy Henderson Korpi, a retiree in northern Minnesota who joined an Indivisible protest group and plans to watch the speech from home. “But what is disturbing more to me is that Congress has essentially just handed over their power.”\n\nShe said, “We could make some sound decisions and changes if Congress would do their job.”\n\nThe country is at a crossroads, celebrating its 250th anniversary while experiencing some of the most significant changes to its politics, policies and general mood in many Americans' lifetimes.\n\nThe president muscled his agenda through Congress when he needed to — often pressuring lawmakers with a phone call during cliffhanger votes — but more often avoided the messy give-and-take of the legislative process to power past his own party and the often unified Democratic opposition.\n\nTrump's signature legislative accomplishment so far is the GOP’s big tax cuts bill, with its new savings accounts for babies, no taxes on tips and other specialty deductions, and steep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid. It also fueled more than $170 billion to Homeland Security for his immigration deportations.\n\nBut the GOP-led Congress has largely stood by as Trump dramatically seized power through hundreds of executive actions, many being challenged in court, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to impose his agenda.\n\n“Retrieving a lost power is no easy business in our constitutional order,” wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court's landmark rebuke of Trump's tariffs policy on Friday.\n\nGorsuch said that without the court stepping in on major questions, “Our system of separated powers and checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.”\n\nFrom slashing the federal workforce to upending the childhood vaccine schedule to attacking Venezuela and capturing that country's president, Trump's reach appeared to know no bounds.\n\nHis administration launched investigations of would-be political foes, imposed his name on historic buildings, including the storied John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and perhaps most visibly has been rounding up people and converting warehouses into detention holding centers for deportations.\n\nAt almost every step of the way, there were moments when Congress could have intervened but did not.\n\nDemocrats, in the minority, often tried to push back, including by halting routine Homeland Security funds unless there are restraints on the immigration actions.\n\nBut Republicans believe the country elected the president and gave their party control of Congress to align with his agenda, according to one senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the dynamic.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said Trump will be the “most consequential” president of the modern era.\n\nDemocrats plan to either boycott the speech or sit in stony silence.\n\n“The state of the union is falling apart,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThere have been times when Congress held its own against the White House, but they have been rare — as in the high-profile bipartisan push from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, over the objections of Johnson and GOP leadership.\n\nThe flex of congressional power has more often come from a few renegade Republicans joining with most Democrats to put a check on the president, as when the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. The Senate advanced a war powers resolution to prevent military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, but backed off after Trump intervened.\n\nThose have been mostly symbolic votes, because Congress would not have the numbers to overcome any expected Trump veto.\n\nMore often, the Congress has accommodated Trump, by rolling back already approved bipartisan funding for USAID foreign aid or public broadcasting or failing to stop the U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that killed two survivors in the Caribbean. When Trump issued a Day One pardon of some 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the Republicans in Congress did not object.\n\nAnd as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with billionaire Elon Musk started firing federal workers, GOP lawmakers signaled approval by forming their own DOGE caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The central question for us is does the public understand what's at stake” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization focused on government management and democracy. “We are in the midst of the most significant transformation of our government and our public servants in our history as a country.”\n\nHe said some 300,000 federal employees were fired or moved on, while 100,000 new hires or rehires have largely gone to Homeland Security.\n\nIn courtrooms across the country, cases are being filed against the administration at record levels, as Congress was “asleep at the wheel,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which has filed more than 150 cases against the administration, part of the largest legal effort against an executive branch in U.S. history.\n\nBut the judicial system has been under strain, and the White House has not always abided by court rulings. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump's criticism of the courts, displaying outside their offices posters of judges they want to impeach.\n\nA next big test will be over a proof-of-citizenship voting bill that Trump wants ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House has passed the SAVE America Act, which would require birth certificates or passports to register to vote in federal elections and a photo ID at the polls. Supporters say it’s needed to crack down on fraud, while critics argue it will shut millions of Americans out of voting because they don’t have citizenship documents readily available.\n\nThe Senate has a majority to pass the measure but not the necessary 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic-led filibuster.\n\nTrump has vowed executive actions if Congress fails to approve legislation.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump responded publicly after Team USA secured a gold medal in men’s hockey at the 2026 Winter Olympics. Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The seven questions Josh Pate asked Donald Trump on his College Football Show originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen Josh Pate announced that Donald Trump would appear on his College Football Show, he promised viewers a politics-free conversation focused strictly on the sport. However, what followed was a brisk, 10-minute exchange that often drifted far from the field.\n\nHere are the seven questions Pate posed and how the answers unfolded in the conversation.\n\nPate opened with a broad question about the sport’s structure and enforceable rules. Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict. What remained was largely softballs and tangents with minimal politics, but arguably just as little substantive college football discussion.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Don...",
    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "After the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations, Christie Brinkley wasted no time in raising her voice.",
    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

    "description": "Tariffs have already added roughly 0.7% to core inflation through January.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump seems to be trying a new approach in his quest to take over Greenland: The president said Saturday the US would send a hospital ship to the territory.\n\n\"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It's on the way!!!\"\n\nGreenland, however, isn't interested.\n\nGreenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a subsequent Facebook post that \"it's going to be a no thank you from here.\" Greenland provides free universal healthcare for all permanent residents and citizens.\n\n\"We have a public health system where treatment is free for citizens.

Trump has suggested the US could buy Greenland or even take it by force.\n\nThe president says Greenland's location makes it strategically important as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China.\n\nThe island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nMajor European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement last month defending Greenland.\n\n\"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of ...",
    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "Uros Medic had an important phone call with Donald Trump",
    "fullText": "Uros Medic may have cleared one major hurdle in his quest to headline a UFC event in his home country.\n\nUFC Houston proved to be a banner show for Medic, who scored a nasty first-round knockout of Geoff Neal in Saturday’s co-main event. Afterwards, Medic called for a fight with former welterweight champion Leon Edwards and for it to take place in Medic’s native Serbia.\n\nHowever, Medic admitted immigration issues have prevented him from leaving the United States and implored President Donald Trump to help clear up the situation.\n\n“I got one little problem,” Medic said. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we’ve got to go to Belgrade, Serbia, for the UFC this summer.”\n\nAccording to Medic, his plea did not fall on deaf ears, as UFC CEO Dana White later invited him to his office to speak to Trump personally. Trump assured Medic that his immigration issues will be taken care of.\n\n“As an immigrant it’s a little hard getting things done,” Medic said. “I know how busy they are, almost everyone in the world wants to live in the United States so immigration, it is hard. They have a lot of work to do and my case has been kind of backed up and not moving, so I was just waiting and waiting and waiting and at one point, I mean, I probably could have mentioned before I’ve been five years in the UFC, five years there was no changes. I have work permit, I’m allowed to work, there was travel documents for me to travel. I never felt safe using them because there was COVID and all this bullshit. So I never used them and I didn’t travel, so at this point I was already at the end of my patience and I had to say something and I think it was a perfect opportunity to speak my mind about it. Again, not wanting to knock them down or talk anything bad about them, I know they’re all trying to do their jobs, but I have to use the position that I’m at and I had to mention it because it’s been hard not being able to travel home.\n\n“Little did I know I get back, a phone call with Dana White, I’m back in his office, and Dana’s got President Donald Trump on speakerphone and I was just standing there, I cannot believe what’s happening. He said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. Just give Dana the documentation information that you need’ and I’m just blown away.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much more bureaucracy Medic actually has to deal with so that he can return home and potentially help White arrange a UFC event in Serbia’s capital, but he was heartened by his conversation with the president, whose wife Melania hails from nearby Slovenia.\n\n“It was just amazing for me to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him and obviously his wife was from where I’m from,” Medic said. “Considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country, it’s like a five-hour drive, that’s nothing for America. You can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.\n\n“I’m still processing all of it. Dana just made my dreams come true for the second time. Third time. First, was to get signed; second, was to go into the top 15; now, I just got to speak with Mr. President on the phone and he said I’m good to travel. My stuff is done, so it’s going to take a minute for me to just process this. A lot has happened in the past hour.”",

    "description": "Trump watches the polls but this is one he might want to skip.",
    "fullText": "It is no secret that Donald Trump keeps his eyes on polling numbers, but there is one that CNN highlighted this week that he will probably want to skip.\n\nBut it also might benefit him to look at it heading into the mid-terms because it just isn’t pretty for the president. And that is because, just a month after Kamala Harris was hit with an embarrassing low on the betting markets as far as her 2028 presidency hopes are concerned, she is now crushing Trump in a new NBC poll that looked back at the 2024 election.\n\n“Regrets … some folks had a few,” CNN data guru Harry Enten said pulling up the results on a screen during the segment.\n\nTrump won the election in Nov. 2024 by just more than a point and a half, per Enten, but in April of 2025 Harris had pulled ahead of him by a point among those polled about recasting their vote.\n\nAnd now she is ahead by a whopping eight points.\n\n“Kamala Harris wins in a redo, asking folks essentially if you could redo the 2024 election, how would you vote?” Enten explained. “She wins it by, get this, eight points. A massive shift from what we saw back in November of 2024 when Donald Trump won by a point, and I will note that this sample was weighted to the 2024 result in which Donald Trump won by a point. And yet Kamala Harris in this weighted sample, she wins by eight amongst the sample that voted for Trump by one.”\n\nEnten then explained how this could signal a swing come mid-terms.\n\n“It has a massive impact on voter sentiment about what may happen late this year,” he said. “Why do I say that? Because let’s take a look at the vote for Congress and this is very important. The 2024 Harris voters, they vote for the Democrats on average by get this, 89 points. The Trump voters vote for Republicans by 83 points.\n\n“This means that the Democratic base that voted for Kamala Harris is sticking with those congressional Democratic candidates more than the Trump voters are sticking with the Republican candidates,” he added. “ And that is why what you are seeing on that generic congressional ballot at this point is Democrats leaping ahead by about five points because the Trump voters are not sticking by Republicans as much as the Harris voters are sticking by the Democrats.”\n\nThe polling got uglier when individuals who didn’t vote in 2024 were added in.\n\n“It’s also people coming off the sideline, OK,” he said looking at the date for voters’ choice in the 2026 congressional elections if they didn’t vote in 2024. “Look at this. Democrats are winning that vote by a significant margin, by 16 percentage points. So you add on to that, the Harris voters sticking with the Democratic candidates, suddenly, you see hey, this is the way the Democrats are going to get back their congressional majority.”",

    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump oddly posted a video of CNN’s Kaitlan Collins — the woman he has dubbed “the worst reporter” — discussing the enormous new banner bearing his visage that she claimed has “erased” the line between the White House and the Department of Justice.\n\nWork crews used a cherry picker to erect the banner over the entrance to the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to miss the the new banner bearing President Trump’s face that just went up here at the Justice Department,” Collins said. “If you’ve been in Washington in recent months you’ve seen similar ones at the Department of Labor or the Department of Agriculture for example, but this one seems to strike a different chord given it’s the Department of Justice.”\n\n“Historically, administrations have tried to stress a level of independence between the West Wing and the White House and their Justice Department, arguing that politics doesn’t influence who is being prosecuted,” Collins continued. “But it’s safe to say that line has been erased since President Trump has taken office in his second term. We’ve seen him directly pressure the Attorney General to prosecute people who he perceives as his political enemies, or people who have led prosecutions against him. The Justice Department said this banner is in honor of America’s upcoming 250th birthday celebration, but if you look at this banner closely, it also echoes what President Trump himself has said, talking about the slogan, ‘Make America Safe Again.'”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Collins “the worst reporter” who never smiles, after she asked a question about the victims of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhen Collins asked, “What would you say to the survivors–” Trump interrupted.\n\n“You are so bad, you know? You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN has no ratings, because of people like you. You know, she’s a young woman. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face–”\n\nWatch the video on Truth Social here.\n\nThe post Trump Oddly Posts Video of CNN Rival Kaitlan Collins Claiming His Giant Banner at the DOJ Symbolizes ‘Erased’ Separation of Powers first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has demanded that Netflix remove former US ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, stepping up his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning with Trump. Speaking on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast published Thursday, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and skirt the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\n\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction,\" and these companies are \"going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice said.\" They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nRice, a Democrat, has a long career in US foreign and domestic policy, working under Democratic presidents.\n\nShe served in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, including roles at the National Security Council and as assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.\n\nUnder Obama, Rice served as US ambassador to the UN, becoming the second-youngest person at 44 and the first Black woman to represent the US at the UN. She later served as head of the Domestic Policy Council under Biden.\n\nShe was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Stanford with a degree in history. She worked in management consulting for McKinsey and Company before entering government.\n\nRice has previously faced criticism from the right. In her 2019 memoir, \"Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\" she wrote that she was a frequent \"villain\" for conservative media.\n\nAfter the 2012 killing of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans accused her of misleading the public in interviews discussing the attacks. She was later cleared by subsequent investigations.\n\nShe also faced scrutiny by Trump and his allies for \"unmasking\" senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York in 2016.\n\nUnmasking is when senior government officials ask to learn the identity of a US citizen whose name has been withheld in intelligence reports about communications, such as intercepted calls. In some situations, national security officials argue that knowing the person's identity is necessary to interpret and assess the intelligence information.\n\nAs UN Ambassador, Rice supported US intervention against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nRice has written op-eds supportive of the Biden administration and accusing Trump of undermining democracy. In a 2025 column in The New York Times, Rice accused members of Trump's national security team of \"reckless negligence\" after they discussed sensitive national security matters on Signal.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "From a purely data-based standpoint, the stock market has been practically unstoppable with Donald Trump in the White House. Although there have been periods of historic volatility, such as the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first term.\n\nThe stock market's outperformance has continued since President Trump's second, non-consecutive term began on Jan. 20, 2025, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq climbing by 14%, 15%, and 16%, respectively, as of the closing bell on Feb. 18, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThis Trump bull market has been fueled by an assortment of factors, such as the rise of artificial intelligence and the advent of quantum computing, as well as policies and proposals directly linked to Trump.\n\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump's flagship tax and spending law from his first term) permanently lowered the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the lowest level since 1939. With businesses keeping more of their income, it's led to record share buybacks from S&P 500 companies -- more than $1 trillion estimated for 2025. Share repurchases can increase earnings per share for public companies with steady or growing net income.\n\nAlthough the Trump bull market may appear infallible, several headwinds are threatening to pull the rug out from beneath it. While some of these catalysts are well known, such as tariff-related uncertainty and historically high stock valuations, the eventual undoing of the Trump bull market may be a surprise culprit: the Federal Reserve.\n\nNormally, the Federal Reserve is Wall Street's financial bedrock. It's America's foremost financial institution tasked with maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. It achieves these goals by adjusting the federal funds target rate -- the overnight lending rate between financial institutions -- and/or conducting open-market operations, such as buying or selling U.S. Treasury bonds. It's a straightforward task guided by copious amounts of economic data.",

    "fullText": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is curious as to why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme, as Washington builds up its military capability ‌in the Middle East, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.\n\n\"I don't want to use the ‌word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use ​the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated,\" Witkoff said during an interview on Saturday with Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" hosted by the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n\"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's ‌what we're prepared to do'? And ⁠yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place.\"\n\nTrump has ordered a huge buildup of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week ⁠air attack on Iran. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases if it is attacked.\n\nIRAN DENIES SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\nThe United States wants Iran to give up enriched uranium which Washington says can potentially be used to make a ​bomb, as ​well as stop supporting militants in the Middle East ​and accept limits to its missile programme.\n\nTehran ‌says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it is willing to accept some curbs on it in return for the lifting of financial sanctions. It rejects tying this to other issues such as missiles and support for armed groups.\n\n\"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear. It's up to 60% (fissile purity),\" Witkoff said. \"They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really ‌dangerous.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran ​and the United States still have differing views over sanctions relief ​in talks.\n\nWitkoff also said he has met ​at Trump's direction with Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, son of the shah ousted ‌in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He did ​not provide further details of ​the meeting.\n\nPahlavi, who lives in exile, served as a rallying figure for some of Iran's opposition during anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people are believed to have been killed, ​the worst domestic unrest since the ‌revolution era.\n\nEarlier in February, Pahlavi said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives, and ​urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear ​deal.",

    "description": "US President unveiled Project Vault, a strategic critical mineral reserve. The initiative highlights an underlying inflation pressures.",
    "fullText": "Commodities had a wild ride last year, and it's continued so far in 2026. Trump's new Project Vault could be a sign of more volatility to come.\n\nThe Trump administration's new critical mineral reserve is meant to secure supply and protect from major price moves, but experts have raised concerns that the reality is that it could ratchet up volatility and be a fresh input for more inflation.\n\nTrump announced Project Vault on February 2, establishing the US Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve.\n\n\"Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we are now creating this reserve for American industry,\" Trump read in an Oval Office announcement.\n\nThe $12 billion reserve is funded by a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States and $2 billion in private financing.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of the United States we've ever stockpiled minerals for our civilian economy,\" David Copley, a White House official, said.\n\nGE Vernova, Western Digital, and Boeing are some of the private companies expected to participate in the project.\n\nProject Vault may pose some risk to the commodity market, but the details remain unclear, and that makes pricing in the risk more difficult for investors.\n\nFGS Global strategists noted that the implementation details are \"critical,\" especially given Trump's tariff policy and ongoing trade negotiations.\n\n\"Project Vault's top-line priority — fostering the resilience of critical minerals supply chains — is open to several competing interpretations, each with radically different approaches,\" partners at Latham & Watkins said.\n\n\"This is essentially about taking steps to redesign the market architecture for critical minerals,\" international trade lawyer Sahar Hafeez said. \"Which minerals are prioritized, how a price floor is calculated, and who signs on—those are the critical next steps.\"\n\nThe Project Vault reserve is expected to impact on supply and demand dynamics and commodity price moves.\n\nJefferies' analyst, Chris LaFemina, said Project Vault's planned reserve would represent only 1% to 3% of global supply, but flags that stockpiling the US is one of many global powers stockpiling, which threatens to fuel inflationary pressures for commodities and the materials sector.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the $12 billion reserve, unlike the existing oil preserve Trump compared it to, will cost roughly $1 billion annually to maintain. He says this ultimately pushes prices higher, which is felt by consumers in the end.\n\n\"So is it inflationary? I mean, look, inflation is driven by a lot of different factors, but this, in and of itself, I think, could potentially become a major inflationary problem,\" LaFemina said in a video posted by the firm this month.\n\nLaFemina expects that the recent upward trend in metals will continue, along with \"significant\" volatility.\n\nGoldman pointed out that Trump's policies shift commodity markets supply-demand balance to be regionally segmented rather than globally, creating a heightened volatility risk.\n\nThey flagged copper as an early example, explaining that prices firmed despite volatility in 2025, as US stockpiling left the rest of the market in deficit amid global oversupply.\n\nThe reserve comes during the Trump administration's efforts to turbocharge the American manufacturing industry and reduce economic reliance on China.\n\nCommodities like silver, copper, and platinum, some of the 60 USGS critical minerals, have seen dramatic price moves recently. Project Vault is intended to insulate American firms from this volatility and safeguard US interests by reducing reliance on China.\n\nCritical minerals, specifically rare earth minerals, have been a key sticking point of US-China trade talks. China is a dominant player at every stage of the critical minerals industry, from mining to refining, meaning it has a lot of control over pricing.\n\nGoldman Sachs believes that Project Vault's stockpiling will focus on these rare earth minerals.\n\nTrade negotiations and unclear supply sourcing are among the other uncertainties that could feed market volatility.\n\nFGS Global strategists said some of the tariffs expected from the administration may \"amplify commodity price volatility,\" adding that the ongoing trade negotiations could stand in the way of a regional critical mineral deal. Trade talks between the US, Mexico, and Canada are set to conclude in July.\n\nAnother consideration is China could restrict supply in response to the US' plans to stockpile. The Trump administration hasn't explained sourcing plans.\n\nJefferies lead metals and mining analyst, LaFemina, said.\n\n\"Sourcing remains unclear, in the interim the US may have to buy from suppliers it's trying to avoid (ie. China).\"",

Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had urged action against Rice, criticizing her role at the company and pointing to recent remarks she made about Trump and corporate America.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning themselves too closely with Trump. Speaking on Thursday on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and break the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\nThe clash comes as the streaming giant pursues a high-stakes merger that will require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nTrump in December said that Netflix had a \"very big market share,\" so its potential acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\"\n\nHowever, in February, he said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal and would defer to his Department of Justice to investigate the proposed merger, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEarlier this week, during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast, Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that Trump hadn't asked for political concessions during discussions of the possible deal, but was focused on bringing jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.\n\nRepresentatives for Netflix and Rice did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump called on Netflix to fire one of its board members, Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, following comments she made about accountability when Democrats return to power.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Saturday, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nTrump Indicates He’s Really Not Into Netflix Buying WB, Wants To Stop The Streamer’s So-Called “Cultural Takeover”\n\n'Real Time': Bill Maher Responds To Trump's Truth Social Rant, Jokes POTUS Expected Him To \"Put Out\" After Dinner\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis week, Rice appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast and said that, for corporate interests, law firms and media, “it is not going to end well for them. For those that decided that they would act in their perceived, very narrow self interest, which I would underscore as very short-term self-interest, and take a knee to Trump, I think they are now starting to realize, ‘Wait a minute, this is not popular. Trump is not popular.'”\n\nShe said that “there is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.”\n\nShe added, “If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, ‘Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,’ I think they got another thing coming.”\n\nReferring to Democrats, she said, “We are not going to play by the old set of rules when these guys are playing by a different set of rules. We are going to play by the law. We are not going to violate the law like they did. But we are not going to be suckers.”\n\nTrump linked to a post from Laura Loomer, who has for months lashed out at Netflix along with other MAGA influencers against the streaming giant’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros., citing in part the its ties to Barack Obama. Rice served as U.S. ambassador the the United Nations in Obama’s first term and national security adviser in his second.\n\nTrump told NBC News earlier this month that he would not be involved in deciding whether his administration will give regulatory approval to a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal or a competing bid from Paramount for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. But he previously said he would be involved, despite the long-held political norm of presidents keeping at arms’ length from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has publicly offered praise for Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, after meeting with him multiple times, including at a White House visit in November.\n\nSarandos appeared before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee at a hearing earlier this month, where he was pressed on the competitive impact of the transaction. But several Republicans on the committee pressed Sarandos on culture war issues, including content featuring transgender individuals, even though the DOJ is reviewing the merger for antitrust issues.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has ties to Trump that include his longtime friend and investor, Larry Ellison, and his son, Skydance founder and the merged company’s CEO, David Ellison. Paramount’s chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, led the DOJ antitrust division during Trump’s first term.\n\nRice’s point — that Democrats will hold companies accountable if they regain power — was underscored this week when a group of senators fired off a letter to David Ellison, asking him to preserve documents after he declined to answer questions about Paramount’s dealings with Trump.\n\nNetflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what???

After that, Congress must vote to extend.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to that 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nThe president's Truth Social post on Saturday, while short on details, indicated he would raise that tariff to 15%.\n\nThe IEEPA-justified tariffs have been among Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements worldwide. They included Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\n\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" the president wrote in his Truth Social post on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the FCC, wants TV broadcasters to rally around the American flag in celebration of the U.S.’s 250th anniversary this year — suggesting that, for example, local stations could start “each broadcast day” with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nOn Friday, Carr announced the Pledge America Campaign, which he framed as part of the White House’s Salute to America 250 Task Force agenda, which “invites citizens to have a renewed love of American history, experience the beauty of our country, and ignite a spirit of adventure and innovation that will raise our nation to new heights over the next 250 years.”\n\nBrendan Carr Confirms FCC Has Begun 'Enforcement Proceedings' Against ABC's 'The View' Over Equal Time Issues\n\nCBS 'Censorship' of Stephen Colbert Slammed by Democratic FCC Commissioner as Latest 'Corporate Capitulation' to Trump Administration\n\nFCC Chairman Says There Are 'Legitimate Competition Concerns' With Netflix's Warner Bros. Deal - but His Agency Has No Authority to Review It\n\nAccording to the FCC, Carr is “heeding this call” put forth by the Trump White House with the Pledge America Campaign, which “enables broadcasters to lend their voices in support of Task Force 250 and the celebration of America’s 250th birthday by airing patriotic, pro-America content that celebrates the American journey and inspires its citizens by highlighting the historic accomplishments of this great nation from our founding through the Trump Administration today.”\n\nThe agency’s announcement comes as Carr has said he wants to help local TV stations push back against national networks on the amount reverse compensation that they pay for programming.\n\nCarr also has taken an aggressive stance in applying the FCC’s rules to fight against what he sees as pro-left bias in some national network programming. That has included his threat to investigate local broadcasters for “news distortion” if they aired “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Carr also has said the FCC “equal time” rule for political candidates will apply to daytime and late-night shows that are deemed to not be “bona fide” news programs. The FCC is investigating ABC’s “The View” for a possible violation of the equal-time rule after Texas politician James Talarico, who is running for the U.S. Senate, appeared on the show. This past Monday, Stephen Colbert said CBS lawyers blocked “The Late Show” from airing his interview with Talarico over concern that it would trigger the FCC equal-time rule.\n\nCarr, in a statement Friday, said, “The White House is leading our national celebration of this historic event with the Salute to America 250 Task Force, which calls on the federal government, among others, to mark this momentous occasion. As part of this effort, I am calling on broadcasters to pledge to provide programming that promotes civic education, national pride and our shared history.”\n\nCarr continued, “This type of programming is more relevant than ever, as surveys show that civics education is in rapid decline. And classic programming such as ‘Schoolhouse Rock!’ is now only found in online archives. Broadcasters are uniquely positioned to help address these concerning developments by providing programming that celebrates the remarkable story of American Independence while also tailoring it to the specific needs of their local communities, in furtherance of their public interest obligations.”\n\nThe FCC’s GOP chairman also provided examples of “nonpartisan” celebratory pro-American programming:\n\nRunning PSAs, short segments or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history\n\nIncluding segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites\n\nStarting each broadcast day with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance\n\nAiring music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington or George Gershwin\n\nProviding daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events that took place on that day in history\n\nPartnering with community organizations and other groups that are already working hard to bring America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Friday said the quickest way to have President Trump act on tariffs “is to tell him that he can’t,” after the Supreme Court ruled that his use of emergency powers to enact his sweeping tariff agenda was unconstitutional.\n\nThe high court’s 6-3 ruling invalidated Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep import taxes on almost all foreign trading partners. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the IEEPA does not apply to the tariffs.\n\nSanders, in an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich, said the court’s ruling was “not only disappointing” but “I think it’s wrong.”\n\n“I think Justice [Clarence] Thomas was exactly right,” she continued. “The Constitution grants the president this authority. “But ultimately, I don’t think it matters. One of the things I love about Donald Trump is that the fastest way to get him to do something is to tell him that he can’t. And he has so many tools in his toolbox.”\n\nThe GOP governor added that Trump will “use whatever tool and resource he needs to get that job done.”\n\n“And while this may, you know, take over the news cycle for a few days, I don’t think it changes what the outcome looks like and that this is a president who’s going to continue to hold other countries feet to the fire,” she said. “He’s going to make sure that American workers are put first.”\n\nTrump called the ruling “disappointing” and lashed out at Roberts and five other justices, including Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — whom he appointed to the bench —calling them all “fools and lapdogs.“\n\n“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth. The two of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House Friday.\n\nHe praised Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a dissent. The president said he was “proud” of Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed in 2018.\n\nThe president followed the ruling with the announcement that he signed an executive order to impose a 10 percent tariff on imports from countries around the world “effective immediately.” He invoked Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision that allows for tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days to address “large and serious” trade deficits, to enact the new levies.\n\nThe White House said Canada and Mexico are exempt from the new tariffs due to the trilateral free trade agreement that was ratified during Trump’s first term in 2020.\n\nSome Republican members of Congress also broke with the president, hailing the Supreme Court ruling as a victory for free trade, the separation of powers, or both.\n\n“Today’s ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders’ system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in his own post online, said the court’s ruling “will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism,” referring to potential 2028 presidential contender Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have been wrong on Trump's policies.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's economic policies have not led to the dire scenarios of recession or steep inflation that many economists have warned about over the last year. According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have so far gotten it wrong.\n\nTrump has challenged the conventional economic norms in multiple ways that economists have warned would stress the system.\n\nTrump's tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court on Friday, but experts spent the year leading up to the decision predicting dire consequences from the sweeping trade policy. For the most part, though, downbeat assessments of tariffs and other Trump policies haven't come to pass.\n\nTrump has used tariffs aggressively and cracked down on immigration, shrinking the labor force, yut the economy has mostly held strong with unemployment still historically low and consumers still spending. He's also tried to erode the Federal Reserve's independence and has added to the national debt with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Interest rates haven't had a big reaction to either development, both of which could be viewed as inflationary.\n\nBen Harris, vice president and director of Economic Studies at Brookings, put out some explanations for the discrepancies this week.\n\nFirst, Brookings thinks everything has turned out better than some expected because the negative impacts of Trump's policies and actions were overestimated to begin with. The Fed is difficult to influence, tariffs aren't as steep as originally thought, and the pass-through to consumers has been smaller than expected.\n\n\"Perhaps mainstream economic models are simply wrong,\" Harris wrote. \"Is it possible the economics profession overstated the value of immigration, free trade, Fed independence, and a sustainable fiscal outlook?\"\n\n\"It's entirely possible that this volatile episode in American policymaking will lead to a greater understanding of the US economy,\" he continued. \"There could be one enduring lesson—learned both over the course of 2025 as well as during the pandemic—that the size and diversity of the U.S. economy usually protects it from sharp downturns.\"\n\nSecond is the positive fiscal impact of both the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the GOP's landmark tax and spending bill — and of all the corporate spending on AI development. Harris pointed out that AI capex accounted for 40% of GDP in 2025; Goldman Sachs sees consumers' disposable incomes expanding by 0.4% in the first six months of 2026 thanks to the OBBBA; and foreign investors have pledged to spend billions of dollars in the US amid Trump's trade wars.\n\nThird and finally, Harris said we may not have seen the final impact of Trump's policies, and it's still too early to issue a verdict on them.\n\n\"This explanation is consistent with economic theory and evidence. The economic impact of curtailed immigration and mass deportations can take years to materialize,\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"The complexity of the FOMC's composition means that it may take years until we see the full impact of political influence,\" he added. \"And on tariffs, as we have heard from our western trading partners recently in Davos, only now have they begun to explore alternatives to the U.S. in terms of trade and investment decisions.\"",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question on whether the U.S. could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a TV interview that his country was planning to finalize a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.\n\n“I don’t think it takes long, perhaps, in a matter of a week or so, we can start real, serious negotiations on the text and come to a conclusion,” Araghchi said on MSNOW's “Morning Joe” show.\n\nThe tensions between the longtime adversaries have ramped up as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades, with more warships and aircraft on the way.\n\nOn Friday, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea after being sent by Trump from the Caribbean, according to images of the ship by maritime photographers posted to social media.\n\nBoth Iran and the U.S. have signaled that they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out. “We are prepared for diplomacy, and we are prepared for negotiation as much as we are prepared for war,” Araghchi said Friday.\n\nAli Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group, said Iran “would treat any kinetic action as an existential threat.”\n\nVaez said he doesn’t think Iran’s leaders are bluffing when they say they would retaliate, while they likely believe they could maintain their hold on power despite any U.S. airstrikes.\n\nTrump said a day earlier that he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal following recent rounds of indirect negotiations, including this week in Geneva, that made little visible progress. But the talks have been deadlocked for years after Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.\n\nAraghchi also said Friday that his American counterparts have not asked for zero enrichment of uranium as part of the latest round of talks, which is not what U.S. officials have said publicly.\n\n\"What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever,\" he said.\n\nHe added that in return, Iran will implement some confidence-building measures in exchange for relief on economic sanctions.\n\nIn response to Araghchi’s claim, a White House official said Trump has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes last June on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump said at the time that the strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, but the exact damage is unknown as Tehran has barred international inspectors.\n\nAlthough Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.\n\nTrump's comments have faced pushback from some lawmakers who say the president should get Congress' approval before any strike.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Friday that he has filed a war powers resolution that would require that step. Though it has no chance of becoming law — in part because Trump himself would have to sign it — some bipartisan consensus has arisen recently among senators who forced votes on previous resolutions on military action in Venezuela.\n\nNone of those resolutions passed, but they were successful in showing how lawmakers are troubled by some of Trump’s aggressive foreign policy maneuvers.\n\n“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price, Ben Finley, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.\n\n“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.\n\nHundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThat prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.\n\nHalligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.\n\nU.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.\n\nLast week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.",

    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "description": "Govs. Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker demand Trump pay Americans $1,700 in tariff refunds after the Supreme Court ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

    "description": "In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upended President Donald Trump's trade agenda and left many major questions unanswered.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a stinging rebuke of the Supreme Court for striking down most of his tariffs.\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" Trump said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump vowed to press on with his trade agenda, starting with a sweeping 10% global tariff that will be in addition to any existing tariffs. The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "title": "Why SCOTUS' rejection of Biden's student-loan forgiveness plays a big role in its Trump tariff decision",
    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",
