    "fullText": "It turns out trans student athletes aren’t the only ones who are having to contend with politicians keeping them from playing sports, now adult trans hockey players are facing challenges too.\n\nHarrison Browne, who starred in Heated Rivalry and was the first openly transgender pro hockey player, is speaking out against USA Hockey’s new eligibility policy, which doesn’t outright ban trans athletes, but makes it almost impossible for them to compete even in recreational leagues.\n\nBack in November, USA Hockey, the national governing body for hockey, which oversees the U.S. participation in the Olympics, quietly released a new Participant Eligibility Policy, but when Browne found out about it yesterday, he immediately took to Instagram to alert his followers to the updated anti-trans rules.\n\n“USA Hockey is basically telling me I can’t play in a recreational league with friends that I played my entire career with,” Browne told PRIDE. “I just think that’s crazy.\"\n\nThe new policy, which updates what previously was a much more inclusive version from 2019, will put strict rules on who can play in youth, junior, disabled, and adult hockey leagues when it goes into effect on April 1, 2026. According to the updated policy, trans athletes can still play in co-ed leagues, but they are restricted to their sex assigned at birth when it comes to sex-exclusive leagues.\n\n“In all programs where participation is restricted by sex, athletes are only permitted to participate in such programs based on their sex assigned at birth, except that a female (as assigned at birth) may not play in programs restricted to females if they have undergone any male hormone therapy,” the policy reads.\n\nThis means that trans women would be forced to play in men’s leagues, and trans men would have to play in women’s leagues unless they take testosterone, in which case they wouldn’t be allowed in either space.\n\n“The safest spaces I’ve found are queer spaces, are women’s spaces,” Browne said, explaining that forcing trans women to play in men’s leagues wouldn’t be safe because they are still plagued by “homophobia and transphobic language, whether that’s on the ice or behind closed doors in the locker room.”\n\nWhile not an outright ban, this new policy will make it nearly impossible for trans hockey players to play in any league overseen by USA Hockey, which includes less competitive recreational leagues, often called “beer leagues” by players.\n\nWomen’s hockey leagues across the country are having to deal with the new policy, with some taking to social media to assure players that they are looking into what it will mean for them. The Seattle Women’s Hockey Club wrote on Instagram, “To our trans members: it is the board's firm belief that our community is better for having you in it. Hockey belongs to anyone who has ever picked up a stick or cheered on their team, and that includes you, regardless of what USA Hockey says.”\n\nBrowne places the blame for this shift from a fairly inclusive trans participation policy to one that, in practice, will likely keep many trans athletes from playing hockey squarely on President Donald Trump’s shoulders. “We can’t overlook the fact that the [Trump] Administration is putting a lot of pressure on sports organizations to make a stance against trans participation in sports,” he said.\n\nRepublicans frequently claim that their focus on trans women in sports is because they care about fairness, but the argument is specious and ignores the larger issues in the sport, Browne said.\n\n“Transgender women, transgender people are not the issue here,” he said. “It is socioeconomic status, it’s access. If you have access to better coaching, if you have access to better facilities, better equipment, better nutrition, you are automatically going to be a better athlete. What hormones people have in their bodies play a very small part in what they are able to do athletically.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 'Heated Rivalry's Harrison Browne says new anti-trans hockey policy is 'crazy' and blames Trump\n\nSo you finished 'Heated Rivalry': Here are 2 ways to get into hockey\n\n7 gayest moments from the Professional Women's Hockey League in 2025 (so far)\n\n5 times athletes lived out the plot of 'Heated Rivalry' in real life",

    "description": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. | As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.",
    "fullText": "As the Trump administration erodes U.S. infrastructure supporting infectious disease vaccines, mRNA heavyweight Moderna plans to pull away from late-stage clinical trial investments in the area.\n\n“We do not foresee investing in new phase 3 studies in a foreseeable futures [sic] in vaccines,” Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel told Bloomberg TV, placing emphasis on the word “new.”\n\nWhen asked if the anti-vaccine climate is going to affect Moderna’s business and ability to develop more vaccines, Bancel said, “100%.”\n\nYou cannot make a return on investment if you don't have access to the U.S. market, or because of delays—regulatory-wise—or because your market is much smaller, because you don't have a recommendation by the government,” Bancel said yesterday on the ‍sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nCurrently, the company touts 12 viral or bacterial vaccine programs in phase 2 development or earlier, according to its online pipeline.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Moderna spokesperson pointed to the company’s priorities set out in its Nov. 20 earnings release. At the time, the mRNA specialist announced the discontinuation of four clinical mRNA programs and outlined a three-year business strategy with the goal of boosting revenue by 10% in 2026.\n\n“Over the next three years, we expect to build a large seasonal vaccine franchise for at-risk populations and invest the cash generated into oncology and rare disease therapeutics,” Bancel said at the time.\n\nThe November release also outlines Europe as “a significant market for respiratory virus vaccines.”\n\nThe Moderna spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for its current phase 2 infectious disease programs.\n\nBancel’s comments come days after Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Ph.D., rebuked Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., describing the lawyer’s stance on vaccines as “anti-science.”\n\nJust a few years ago, Moderna and Pfizer raced to develop and deliver COVID-19 vaccines—Spikevax and Comirnaty, respectively—to abate the worldwide pandemic. Their efforts and success prompted major revenue and investment not only into their companies but into the biopharma industry itself.\n\nBut over the last year, U.S. mistrust in vaccines has continued to accelerate, as long-time vaccine conspiracist RFK. Jr. divests and dismantles federal infrastructure for the science. Just this month, the CDC overhauled the longstanding U.S. childhood vaccine schedule, removing broad vaccination recommendations for COVID, flu, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.\n\nFor Bancel, the falling-out means Moderna is turning its focus toward cancer. Earlier this week, the company shared five-year data for its Merck & Co.-partnered cancer vaccine, which, when combined with Keytruda, cut the risk of cancer recurrence or death by 49% in comparison to Keytruda alone.\n\nThe move isn’t shocking, as Moderna’s Kyle Holen, M.D., head of development, therapeutics and oncology, told Fierce in October that most of the company's upcoming investigational new drug applications will be in the oncology space. Holen cited the political climate for developing infectious disease vaccines and “a huge unmet need in cancer” as reasons behind the decision.\n\nThough Moderna is moving away from vaccines for infectious diseases, Bancel has expressed disappointment about the action.\n\n“It is sad for us to see that. Vaccines that have been proven for decades helping people around the world are not recommended anymore,” he told Bloomberg TV.\n\n“If you look at all healthcare interventions, getting a vaccine is one of the highest return investments in the same year—not 10 or 20 years out—to prevent cardiac attack,” the leader said about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, noting that the inoculations also prevent hospitalizations related to severe illness.\n\n“We tend to forget that hospitalization is a big deal,” Bancel continued. “If you are 67 years old, you get hospitalized—in a week, you can lose 10% of your muscle mass. Ten percent muscle mass doesn't seem a lot like this, but it might mean the difference between you being able to live a high-quality life and your life becoming living from your bed to your sofa. So that’s the message about vaccines.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A report by former special counsel Jack Smith on his investigation into President Donald Trump's hoarding of classified documents belongs in the “dustbin of history\" and should remain sealed, the Justice Department said in a sharply worded court filing Friday.\n\n“The illicit product of an unlawful investigation and prosecution belongs in the dustbin of history. The United States will leave it there,” prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe department's position echoes that of Trump, whose lawyers this week asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to permanently block the release of the Smith report. It adds to the likelihood that a detailed report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump might continue to remain hidden from public view.\n\nSmith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Biden and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after he left the White House following his first term.\n\nBoth investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith's team after Trump's November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.\n\nThe volume on the election investigation was released in the final days of the Biden administration. But Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge in Florida who issued multiple favorable rulings for Trump and his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, last year granted a defense request to at least temporarily halt the release of the report dealing with that case. That edict meant that Smith could not discuss the substance of that investigation when he testified Thursday before the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe injunction is set to lift on February 24.\n\nBut Jason Reding Quiñones, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where the case was filed, said in a three-page court filing that the report should remain sealed. He and another prosecutor in that office, Manolo Reboso, wrote that Smith's investigation was “unlawful from its inception.”\n\nThey also wrote that Attorney General Pam Bondi had determined that the report was “an internal deliberative communication that is privileged and confidential and should not be released” outside the Justice Department.\n\n“Smith not only weaponized the Department of Justice against a leading presidential candidate in pursuit of an anti-democratic end, but he did so without legal authority and while targeting constitutionally protected activity,” the prosecutors wrote.\n\nSmith, during his testimony Thursday, defended his investigations of Trump and insisted that he had acted without regard to politics and had no second thoughts about the criminal charges he brought.\n\n“No one should be above the law in our country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,” Smith said of Trump.",

    "fullText": "Lawmakers and military families denounced President Donald Trump’s shocking remarks denigrating NATO troops who were injured and died fighting for the U.S. in Afghanistan after the September 11 terror attacks.\n\nSpeaking to Fox Business on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Trump questioned whether NATO “will be there if we ever need them.”\n\n“We’ve never needed them,” he told Maria Bartiromo. “We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, and they did—they stayed a little back, little off the front lines. But we’ve been very good to Europe and to many other countries.”\n\nHis message sparked outrage in the U.K., which sent more than 150,000 troops to Afghanistan in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.\n\nThe British contingency, which, after the U.S., was the second largest of the campaign, lost 457 soldiers, while thousands more were injured.\n\n“They were absolutely on the front lines,” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died in Afghanistan when he was 18, told The Mirror. “And to ignore that because, let’s face it, Trump isn’t particularly hot on history… He is so out of touch with the reality, and what it costs in human life. He has no compassion whatsoever for anyone who doesn’t serve him.”\n\nDiane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson suffered horrific injuries in Afghanistan in 2006, said Trump’s latest comments were “the ultimate insult.”\n\nStarmer’s official spokesperson pointed out that the response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks was the only time NATO has invoked Article 5, the alliance’s collective defense principle that treats an attack on one member as an attack on all, The Telegraph reported.\n\n“Their sacrifice and that of other Nato allies was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Starmer’s spokesperson said of the soldiers who were wounded and killed. “The president was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops.”\n\nStarmer later called Trump’s comments about NATO troops “insulting and frankly appalling.”\n\n“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice they made for their country,” he said. “I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling and I am not surprised they have caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured and, in fact, across the country.”\n\nStarmer said Trump should apologize for the comments.\n\nEven the Conservative Party blasted Trump’s remarks, with Tory leader Kemi Badenoch calling them “absolutely appalling” and “disgraceful,” according to The Telegraph.\n\nConservative member of Parliament Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our NATO partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States,” according to ABC.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe president’s dumping on NATO troops was reminiscent of his previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during WWI were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nIn December, he struggled to muster much sympathy for the families of Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only “for cause,” which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.\n\nLast year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire — at least temporarily — Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed’s board of governors.\n\n“We disagree,” the court said then. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.”\n\nThat is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.\n\nAllowing Cook’s firing to go forward “would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation’s highest court.\n\nBut the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?\n\nSeveral legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.\n\n“There’s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,” said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. “The whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven’t explained exactly why.”\n\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, “I’ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.”\n\nJust last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the “unitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.\n\nAgency directors, like Slaughter, “are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries” without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed’s monetary policy — the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply — historically hasn’t been overseen by the executive branch.\n\nSome legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, “Whereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"\n\nThe First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both “conducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.\n\nBut Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.\n\nThere are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.\n\n“There is no fourth type of government power,” Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.”\n\nStill, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.\n\nAnd even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook “for cause,” while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.\n\n“There is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. “And we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing.”\n\nPaul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, “it’s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it’s not that different. This is just like the FTC.”\n\nInstead, Clement added, “they come in and say, no, we’re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.\n\nFor now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.\n\n“I don’t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there’s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,” Clement said. “And there’s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.”",

Many of the posts appeared in his feed twice in a row.\n\nTrump, 79, began his posting spree by claiming he had helped to save TikTok by announcing the Chinese social media company would now operate in the U.S. under a majority American-owned joint venture.\n\nRepublican megadonor Larry Ellison’s company Oracle will hold a 15 percent stake in TikTok U.S. Ellison, a close friend of Trump, will also steer Oracle’s “retraining” of TikTok’s trademark algorithm.\n\n“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I only hope that long into the future I will be remembered by those who use and love TikTok.”\n\nIronically, Trump had tried to ban TikTok in 2020, citing national security fears, but used the Chinese-owned app to broaden his appeal with younger voters during his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump’s dump of posts covered everything from a trailer for wife Melania’s Amazon documentary to reposting video from Fox News and Joe Rogan’s podcast.\n\nThere were also clips of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and uploaded PDF printouts of a NewsMax cover story on Trump from December.\n\nThe president also shared negative posts towards his political foes, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHis feed was also filled with doubled-up posts about the 2020 election being stolen, clips from UFC boss Dana White, and claims that he is having success with his handling of the American economy—despite polls suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe also shared content from a fan account dedicated to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Unfortunately for Trump, one of the posts read “American is back!!!” rather than “America is back!!!”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s post-midnight Truth Social onslaught follows an earlier social media frenzy from Europe. He spent more than an hour firing off posts attacking his critics and sharing gushing posts after the embarrassment of world leaders snubbing his “Board of Peace” signing ceremony.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nHe included more conspiracy theories about the 2020 election fraud as well as questionable claims about ICE being allowed to use force against Minnesota protesters.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has completely misunderstood what global warming means in a bonkers post on social media.\n\nThe U.S. is facing a potentially historically cold period, with the eastern two-thirds of the country expected to experience sub-zero temperatures and heavy snowfall, which could cause major disruption. For the president, that is proof enough that “global warming” is a hoax.\n\n“Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States,” he said on Truth Social. “Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain—WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”\n\nIt is not entirely clear who he meant by “Environmental Insurrectionists.”\n\nThe world’s most powerful man has repeatedly shown he is apprehensive about the existence of climate change, championing fossil fuel policies and peddling conspiracy theories, despite an overwhelming body of scientific evidence that it poses a real and imminent threat.\n\nIt has long been public knowledge that the now-relegated term global warming does not mean that cold temperatures will not occur, but rather that the average temperature inside the Earth’s atmosphere will be higher, disrupting delicate environmental balances.\n\nThe term is now instead regarded as merely a part of the wider phenomenon of climate change.\n\nCold landmasses and warm waters in the Arctic are stretching the polar vortex, dragging cold air further south. When that cold air meets warm, moist southern air, it could cause heavy snow, PBS reports.\n\nOn its website, the American Red Cross said, “Winters are getting warmer and shorter because of the climate crisis. But, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, heavier snowfalls are more likely to occur,” the Guardian reports.\n\nThe BBC reports that “cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York,” could be blanketed with snow.\n\nThe National Weather Service said the weather could “pose a life-threatening risk of hypothermia and frostbite to exposed skin.”\n\nThe storm is expected to reach as far west as New Mexico, with around 230 million people staring down the barrel of 20-degree temperatures as state governors declare emergencies across the country.\n\nTrump’s disregard for the environment is well-documented. On his first day back in the Oval Office last year, he gave an executive order called “Putting people over fish,” where he disregarded the endangered delta smelt as “an essentially worthless fish,” and demanded water from their habitat be taken to fight fires hundreds of miles away.\n\nHe has also waged a long-running war on wind turbines, claiming “windmills” are making whales crazy and killing bald eagles, a point he illustrated on social media by posting a picture of a dead falcon in Israel.\n\nIn September, he gave a speech to the United Nations, where he said climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”\n\nDuring the same speech, he said, “I have a little standing order in the White House,” he said. “Never use the word ‘coal’. Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal’. Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump lashed out at Gavin Newsom for spoiling his appearance at the Davos, Switzerland, summit this week.\n\nThe California governor attended the forum, spending his time criticizing the president and his administration while urging allies to “stand united.” At one point, the 58-year-old claimed he was denied entry into the U.S. hub.\n\nNewsom looked on as Trump addressed political and business leaders on Wednesday, then criticized the president’s “boring, and at times boorish,” speech.\n\n“It was insignificant in its insignificance. He said what we all knew: that he’s not going to invade Greenland,” he told The Guardian.\n\nTrump, who has backed down from his threat of military invasion and tariffs on other European nations, still couldn’t seem to get over Newsom’s appearance.\n\n“Gavin Newscum, as a “Lame Duck” Governor of a Failing State, should not be at Davos running around screaming for the attention of Foreign Leaders, and embarrassing our Country,“ Trump, 79, grumbled on Truth Social. “He made a mockery of himself, and everybody, including his staff, knows it!”\n\nTrump went on to attack the governor, who is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2028, on California-specific issues.\n\n“With a record like he’s got,” Trump concluded, “the ruination of one of the most beautiful places on Earth, where people are leaving in droves, it is unimaginable that he could run for President but, who knows, it’s a very strange World!”\n\nNewsom, 58, responded succinctly to Trump’s 158-word attack.\n\nNewsom also took shots at Trump’s backers who followed the president’s lead in criticizing him.\n\nWhen radio host Bill Mitchell captioned a photo of Newsom, “That look you have when you’re not winning and you know it,” the Democrat fired back: “That look when every MAGA doormat can’t stop talking about you.”\n\nIt was only a matter of time before White House Communications Director Steven Cheung got involved.\n\nCheung, who recently went after Newsom for criticizing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and world leaders at Davos who suck up to Trump, gave his own caption of Newsom’s photo.\n\n“The look of someone who realizes they’re at the point of no return and giving up control to others is the only way to satisfy his home life,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe Newsom bashing continued into the night on Fox News.\n\nWhile Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick did some pearl-clutching about Newsom selling kneepads with Trump’s signature, Katie Miller, the wife of Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, suggested that there was a large amount of voting and welfare fraud happening in his state, and complained that Newsom “still hasn’t turned over his voter rolls or welfare list to us.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted Newsom’s office and the White House for comment.\n\nPreviously, the White House told the Daily Beast, “No one in Davos knows who third-rate governor Newscum is or why he is frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”",

    "description": "The correspondent recounted asking a question to the president in September related to the First Amendment.",
    "fullText": "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl recalled a specific encounter with President Donald Trump when asked if the president has ever made him “fear” for his safety.\n\nDuring an interview with comedian Hasan Minhaj released Wednesday, Karl pointed to an exchange with Trump in September. While standing with other reporters on the South Lawn, Karl asked the president about comments made by Attorney General Pam Bondi in the wake of the assassination of late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s going to go after hate speech? Is that, I mean, a lot of people, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl said, according to a video of the interaction.\n\nTrump replied: “She’d probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It’s hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”\n\n“Would that be appropriate?” Karl could be heard responding in the background, as Trump went on to say, “Maybe they will come after ABC. ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they’ll have to go after you.”\n\nIn his comments, the president appeared to reference how ABC News agreed in December 2024 to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over statements about Trump made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nKarl said he asked the president a “very simple question” and called his initial answer a “shocking moment.”\n\n“So the idea that the president of the United States is suggesting that the power of the Department of Justice could be brought to bear against journalists, who the president of the United States doesn’t believe are fair — that’s a very interesting reading of the First Amendment,\" Karl said.\n\nDuring the interview with Minhaj, Karl also discussed how a theme of Trump’s reelection campaign was vowing to “go after” his perceived political enemies. He pointed to his pardons of Jan. 6 rioters on the first day of his second term, as well as the “hollowing out” of the FBI and DOJ.\n\n“There’s nobody like at the White House now telling Donald Trump, ‘Look, sir, we really shouldn’t do this,’” Karl said. “I mean, people advise him, but it’s like he’s got the people around him who are going to carry out the orders.”",

    "description": "It's like the last few days never happened.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 closed up 0.55% yesterday on good news about U.S. GDP growth and President Trump retracting his threat to impose more tariffs on Europe if he isn’t given Greenland. After a selloff earlier this week, the S&P is again above 6,900 and within 1% of its all-time high. Gold hit another record yesterday, too.\n\nBut futures on the index were down 0.24% prior to the opening bell in New York and markets in Europe sold off slightly this morning after Asia closed mixed, a sign that traders are booking profits after yesterday’s rally. \n\nOn the macro front, Wall Street analysts are bullish. It’s a marked change from the fraught mood of the last few days.\n\nIn fact, Trump’s tariffs are turning out to be a much smaller economic deal than “earlier worst-case fears,” JPMorgan Chase says. Companies have adjusted their pricing and supply chains, and the result is “the realized tariff rate has been much lower at ~11% (versus expectations of 15%,”), according to Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and his team. “Only 14% of S&P 500 companies are highly sensitive to tariffs.”\n\nAnd it could get better if the U.S. Supreme Court decides the president lacks the power to unilaterally enact tariffs, the bank says.\n\n“Prediction markets assign >65% odds that the Supreme Court rules against the government, and those odds have consistently been against the government, especially following the November Supreme Court oral arguments,” Lakos-Bujas told clients.\n\nAnalysts were also cheered by a new upward revision for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of last year, at 4.4%.\n\n“The 4.4% real growth rate is much higher than normal and is likely to moderate over the course of the year, but if we can stay above 3% for the entire year it could lead to double-digit returns in the stock market,” Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management said in an email seen by Fortune.\n\nEY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco was singing from the same hymnbook. “Momentum was driven by resilient consumer spending, robust equipment and AI-related investment, a sizeable boost from net international trade, and a rebound in federal government outlays. The U.S. economy is neither overheating nor stalling—it is adjusting,” he said in a note.\n\nAll of that explains the calm we’re seeing in the markets today.\n\n“For some assets, it was almost like the selloff never happened, with the VIX index of volatility (-1.26pts) back at 15.64pts, which is beneath its levels prior to Saturday’s tariff announcements,” according to Jim Reid and his team at Deutsche Bank.",

    "description": "He did not hold back against the media.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino harshly tore into the media during his first televised interview since departing President Donald Trump’s administration, describing outlets as having “a full diaper all the time.”\n\nBongino, a former Secret Service agent, officially returned to private life earlier this month after serving in his role in the FBI for less than a year. Since his departure, he announced he will return to hosting his self-titled podcast show in early February while becoming increasingly candid on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News late Thursday, Bongino accused the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nEarlier in the day, Axios reported — citing data from the Council on Criminal Justice — that the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900. However, the outlet noted that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade law during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office, indicating it raises questions about whether Trump’s policies have had an impact on the decline.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” Bongino told host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these dumba----.”\n\nHe then pointed to a story from The New York Times, which released interviews with 45 current and former employees who accused the FBI under its director, Kash Patel, of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?”\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge,“ he continued. ”Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country.\"\n\nBongino went on to say that the media is a “big full diaper,” adding he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity declared that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” noting that he was more restrained while working for the FBI.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”",

    "description": "At Davos, the California governor criticized Trump, was blocked from the US pavilion, traded insults, waved kneepads, and fueled 2028 speculation.",
    "fullText": "Gavin Newsom's return to Davos was always going to be loud. It just wasn't clear how chaotic it would get.\n\nOver the course of a few days in the Swiss Alps, the California governor criticized President Donald Trump, was denied entry to the USA House, waved red kneepads at corporate leaders, and traded insults with Trump's Treasury secretary.\n\nNewsom had framed his attendance at the World Economic Forum as a direct challenge to Trump on the global stage.\n\nLast week, his office said he planned to rebut the president's economic agenda, defend \"democratic capitalism,\" and position California as a counterweight to what he called Trump's \"crony capitalism.\"\n\nTrump spoke first, addressing business and political leaders on Wednesday morning. Newsom, watching from the room, criticized the speech shortly afterward.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, including Business Insider's Ben Bergman, Newsom said the audience reaction was muted because Trump spoke down to people, adding that \"had there not been cellphones, I think a few people would have passed out from boredom.\"\n\nAnna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, later dismissed Newsom as a \"third-rate governor\" in comments to Business Insider, saying that it was unclear why he was \"frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.\"\n\nTensions escalated hours later on Wednesday when Newsom was denied entry to the USA House, the official US pavilion at Davos, where he was scheduled to talk in a fireside chat hosted by Fortune.\n\nNewsom's office said the invitation was rescinded at the last minute due to pressure from the White House and State Department.\n\nNewsom blasted the move on X, calling it \"weak and pathetic\" to block a fireside chat. His office said that multiple Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, had spoken at the pavilion earlier that day.\n\nBessent, for his part, didn't hold back. He publicly called Newsom \"economically illiterate,\" \"smug,\" and \"too self-absorbed,\" escalating what had already become a personal feud playing out in front of the global business elite.\n\nNewsom got his biggest moment on Thursday during another scheduled Davos appearance.\n\nIn an onstage interview with Semafor's Ben Smith, he said that the US was no longer governed by the rule of law but by what he called \"the rule of Don,\" accusing Congress, universities, law firms, and corporate leaders of bending the knee to the president.\n\nTo make the point, Newsom brought in bright red kneepads — a prop meant to symbolize corporate capitulation — drawing applause from the audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, acknowledged Newsom in his own Davos remarks on Wednesday. \"We're going to help the people in California,\" Trump said. \"We want to have no crime. I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin is a good guy.\"\n\nThe governor declined a later invitation to return to the USA House for a private nightcap reception.\n\nPolitical experts told Business Insider that Newsom's return to Davos signals ambitions beyond California.\n\nHis decision to confront Trump in front of global business and political leaders has renewed speculation that he is laying the groundwork for a potential 2028 presidential bid.",

He described his strip search in detail, including prison staff searching his mouth and tongue as well as his genitalia.\n\nZhao's pardon has drawn scrutiny, with some onlookers questioning Trump's motives. Binance has promoted USD1, the stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a crypto asset manager backed by the Trump family.\n\n\"The American people deserve transparency regarding whether the pardon power was exercised impartially or influenced by personal financial interests,\" Rep. Robert Garcia wrote in a November letter.\n\nTrump also denied knowing who Zhao is in a \"60 Minutes\" interview following the pardon.\n\nIn his CNBC interview, Zhao also appeared to position himself as removed from the process. Of the pardon procedure, he said, \"I still don't know what the process is.\"\n\nZhao said his motivation for applying for a pardon came from media coverage speculating that he could receive one. After he applied, the administration was a \"black box.\"\n\n\"What people suggested the most is: get in front of Trump yourself,\" Zhao said. \"But I never got in front of Trump. I just waited and waited and waited, and suddenly it happened.\"\n\nHas he spoken to Trump? \"No, not yet,\" Zhao said.\n\nThe closest he's gotten, he said, was Trump's \"Board of Peace\" signing in Davos. Zhao was in the audience, some 30 to 40 feet away from the president who pardoned him.\n\n\"Never talked to him,\" he said. \"Never shook hands.\"",

    "fullText": "Jake Tapper shamed Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday after the White House press secretary lied about President Donald Trump confusing Greenland for Iceland in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland.\n\nPosting a video to his personal X account, the CNN host mocked Leavitt for arguing that the president wasn’t “mixing anything up.”\n\n“I mean, you know that that was filmed, right?” Tapper asked incredulously.\n\nWatch the video of Tapper’s breakdown — which includes the clips in question — below:\n\n“Earlier today, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump, at least three times referred to Greenland, a territory he wants to seize or purchase from Denmark, three times referred to Greenland as Iceland,” Tapper said before introducing Leavitt’s defense.\n\n“When a reporter went on X and pointed this out, the White House press secretary, whose salary your tax dollars pay for, wrote, ‘No he didn’t Libby, his written remarks referred to Greenland as a piece of ice because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here. OK?'”\n\nA claim to which Tapper replied: “Let’s roll the tape.”\n\nSpeaking in Davos on Wednesday, there were unmistakably several instances where Trump said “Iceland” when he meant to say “Greenland.” “When I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy,” he said in one moment; “Our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money,” he said in another.\n\n“This all reminds me of this great, horrifying quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel ‘1984,’” Tapper pondered on his social video.\n\n“‘The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,'” the host quoted. “But we don’t live in 1984 and we don’t have to reject the evidence of our eyes and ears. We know that he confused Iceland with Greenland or Greenland with Iceland. And I mean, you can lie to us if you want, but I don’t know why it’s worth it.”\n\nThe post Jake Tapper Shames Karoline Leavitt for Lying About Trump’s Greenland-Iceland Mix-Up: ‘Let’s Roll the Tape’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump spent two hours on Truth Social attacking his enemies and reposting praise after world leaders ignored his “Board of Peace” ceremony in Davos.\n\nThe 79-year-old president shared almost a post a minute on Thursday, hours after his “Board of Peace” initiative at the World Economic Forum attracted a motley crew of Trump-allied leaders from the Middle East and South America.\n\nBetween 10:38 am and 1:01 pm EST, Trump fired off 51 posts, several of which were screenshots of people agreeing with videos he’d posted seconds earlier.\n\nSubjects covered in the posting barrage include a video of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller bashing Trump’s enemies, a court victory that will allow ICE to use force against protestors in Minnesota, 2020 election fraud conspiracies, threats to sue the New York Times for publishing polls that displease him, and rants against Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith was publicly testifying before Congress about the case he had built against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election when the president wrote, “Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nThe president’s posting rampage comes at the end of a humiliating and widely criticized trip to the World Economic Forum.\n\nAfter giving a speech on Wednesday in which he intimated the U.S. could take control of Greenland, Trump met with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, who apparently talked him down. Trump walked away from the meeting claiming he’d gotten the “framework of a deal” for the United States on Greenland, but didn’t give any specifics.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump suffered a fresh humiliation at the “Board of Peace” signing party.\n\nThe White House hyped the “Board of Peace” initiative, which nations can join for a $1 billion fee, as a coalition of nations that “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”\n\nThough the White House expected representatives from 35 countries at the ceremony, fewer than 20 showed up. World leaders otherwise in attendance at Davos, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, all ignored Trump’s endeavor.\n\nTrump was left signing what critics called a MAGA-fied U.N. charter with the likes of Argentinian President Javier Milei and far-right Hungarian leader Viktor Orban.\n\nTrump called every world leader who signed onto the Board of Peace a “great friend of mine.”\n\nShortly after Trump’s posting spree concluded, his account adopted a different, more optimistic tone.\n\n“Heading back to D.C. It was an incredible time in Davos,” Trump posted at 1:45 pm. “The Greenland structure is being worked on, and will be amazing for the U.S.A., and the Board of Peace is something that the World has never seen before — Very special. So many good things happening! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people involved in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church have been arrested, Trump administration officials said Thursday, even as a judge rebuffed related charges against journalist Don Lemon.\n\nVice President JD Vance, speaking in Minneapolis, urged state and local law enforcement to collaborate with federal officials and said protesters must stop getting in their way.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi posted online that Nekima Levy Armstrong had been arrested. On Sunday, protesters entered the Cities Church in St. Paul, where an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official serves as a pastor. Bondi later posted that a second person had been arrested, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced a third.\n\nThe Justice Department quickly opened a civil rights investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month.\n\n“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,\" the attorney general wrote on X.\n\nCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads an ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.\n\nChurch lawyers praise the arrests\n\nProminent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have argued that compassion for migrant families cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.\n\nAttorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.\n\n“The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,” Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, said in a statement.\n\nThe St. Paul-based nonprofit law firm has taken on religious freedom cases, including filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a Christian counselor who challenged bans on LGBTQ+ “conversion therapy” for kids as a violation of her First Amendment rights.\n\nLevy Armstrong, an attorney and longtime activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a “fundamental moral conflict.”\n\n“You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,” she said Tuesday. “When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renee Good’s, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.”\n\nVance wants local law enforcement to assist federal officers\n\nState and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.\n\nVance arrived in the state less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good’s death a “tragedy of her own making.”\n\nBefore his Minnesota visit, Vance warned the church protesters: “Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so.\"\n\nLater in Minneapolis, he urged state and city law enforcement to help federal immigration officers.\n\n“We’re doing everything that we can to lower the temperature,” Vance said, adding that he wants “state and local officials to meet us halfway.”\n\nGreg Bovino, a U.S. Border Patrol official, said Minneapolis police failed to help federal agents Wednesday who were surrounded by protesters at a gas station. Minneapolis police responded later that they hadn't received any requests from federal agents for assistance on Wednesday.\n\nLevy Armstrong has helped lead protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.\n\nPatel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under a law that prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.\n\nLevy Armstrong, Kelly and Allen have all been booked about 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Minneapolis in Sherburne County Jail, where people in federal custody are usually held.\n\nA message seeking comment was sent to Allen's and Kelly's attorney.\n\nSaint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a board of education member, said it is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters.\n\nAllen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists.\n\nKelly has defended the protest and criticized the church for associating with a pastor who works for ICE.\n\nIn court Thursday, federal magistrate judge Doug Micko granted the women bond and restricted them from traveling outside Minnesota or from going near the church. The government said it would appeal and the women remained in federal custody Thursday afternoon.\n\nLevy Armstrong’s attorney, Jordan Kushner, said he offered for her to turn herself in peacefully, but the Trump administration insisted on arresting her.\n\n“They wanted a spectacle,” Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, said, recalling around 50 agents came to detain her.\n\nArrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the church protest swiftly, but found no basis for a civil rights investigation into Good's death.\n\nAdministration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled toward him. Past administrations, however, have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJudge rejects charges against Lemon\n\nA magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors’ bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, said Kushner, Levy Armstrong’s attorney.\n\nLemon has said he was at the church as a journalist and not a protester.\n\n“Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,” Lemon said in a video posted on social media. “That’s it. That’s called journalism.”\n\nLemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement that the judge’s action confirms Lemon’s work as a reporter was protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt wasn’t immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge’s decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.\n\nCNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.\n\nDurkin Richer reported from Washington. Associated Press reporters Chris Megerian in Washington; Corey Williams in Detroit; Jack Dura in Bismarck, North Dakota; and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed.",

    "description": "The relationship between President Donald Trump and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon has oscillated between public barbs and admissions of respect.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon is known for saying what he thinks. At Davos, the JPMorgan CEO was uncharacteristically constrained when talking about Donald Trump and his policies, striking a cautious balance between criticism and praise. \n\nThis is a familiar dance in a relationship that has swung between mutual respect and open hostility since Trump first took office in 2016.\n\nDimon, who once described himself as \"barely a Democrat,\" has publicly criticized some of Trump's economic and political policies, including on tariffs, while also praising his deregulatory moves and efforts to grow the economy.\n\n\"He was kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China,\" Dimon said in Davos in 2024, while in the same breath saying he didn't like some of Trump's rhetoric.\n\nNow that Trump has filed suit against Dimon and JPMorgan for $5 billion over claims of politically-motivated debanking, here's a look at their relationship over the years.\n\nAlthough he financially supported Hillary Clinton's 2008 run for office, Dimon didn't publicly endorse a candidate that year, in 2012, or in 2016. He said in a memo following Trump's victory that his win reflected a \"deep desire for change\" across the country.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO sat on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that first met in February of 2017 and focused on how government policies affected economic growth. After Trump's inflammatory response to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, members of the council, including Dimon, decided to disband the group.\n\nShortly thereafter, Trump announced that he was disbanding the group in a post on then-Twitter.\n\nTrump said in the recent lawsuit that JPMorgan told him in February 2021 that it was closing his accounts, along with accounts of some of his family's businesses. Trump, along with some other conservatives, has criticized perceived politically motivated \"debanking\" in recent months, claiming that JPMorgan and other banks have shut down the accounts of conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican primaries, Dimon openly praised former UN ambassador Nikki Haley and advised Democrats to support her if they didn't want to face Trump again.\n\n\"Even if you're a very liberal Democrat, I urge you, help Nikki Haley, too,\" he said at the DealBook Summit. \"Get a choice on the Republican side that might be better than Trump.\"\n\nDimon also said he was ready to work with Trump again, should he win reelection.\n\nThe banker's call for supporting Haley drew Trump's ire, with the then-former president calling Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's tone on Dimon changed during a 2024 interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, in which he said he had \"a lot of respect\" for the JPMorgan CEO.\n\n\"He is somebody that I would consider, sure,\" he added when asked if Dimon could be his next Treasury Secretary.\n\nTrump ramped up pressure on Dimon in the lead-up to the 2024 election, posting on Truth Social that Dimon had endorsed him.\n\nDimon denied he'd endorsed Trump through a JPMorgan spokesperson.\n\nThe pair's public relationship grew tense again in the summer of 2025, after Trump signed an executive order for federal banking regulators to eliminate guidance that encourages what he calls \"politicized\" or \"unlawful\" debanking.\n\nTrump told CNBC that JPMorgan and Bank of America had refused to accept his deposits, saying that the financial institutions \"discriminate against many conservatives.\"\n\nTrump's claims of discrimination gave way to his $5 billion lawsuit against JPMorgan and its CEO. The bank denies any wrongdoing related to the closure of Trump's accounts, saying that account closures are sometimes required \"because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company.\"\n\n\"We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" reads a January statement from JPMorgan.\n\nHowever, the suit isn't the only recent point of tension between Trump and Dimon. Dimon has become more outspoken in his opposition to some of Trump's latest economic policies, including lambasting Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest as an \"economic disaster.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans.\n\nIn a January interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Dimon also reiterated his belief in the Fed's independence, which has come into question in recent days amid the Justice Department's investigation into the central bank.\n\nDimon said there was \"absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason\" that he would serve as Fed Chair, but he did say he would \"consider\" the job of Treasury Secretary — if it was offered.\n\nHe'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision, Dimon said.",

    "description": "Casper Frank Møller, CEO of Raw Arctic, explains how his Greenland tourism firm handles global attention and uncertainty amid renewed US interest.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Casper Frank Møller, 28, the CEO and cofounder of Raw Arctic, a tourism business based in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAbout three and a half years ago, my friend Isak and I traveled along the west coast of Greenland to explore. We both love spending time outdoors — Isak is an expert in Arctic hiking and hunting, and I love fly fishing.\n\nWe're also outgoing, and wherever we went, people seeking tourist opportunities would ask us if we wanted to be their guides. That made us realize there was a gap in the market for adventure tours that we really wanted to exploit.\n\nIn 2024, we, along with our third cofounder, established our company, Raw Arctic.\n\nThere are a lot of different tourist companies in Greenland. It's actually a highly competitive market, and you have to find a way to differentiate yourself.\n\nWe decided to go with more expensive, tailor-made tours for adventure-seeking clientele who want to explore the entirety of Greenland.\n\nFor example, we've had customers who charter a helicopter for multiple days and go skiing in the mountains, spending upward of 20,000 pounds (about $26,000) a day.\n\nWhen Trump resurfaced the topic of taking Greenland in early 2025, we saw a rapid surge of interest in tourists wanting to visit. The attention was really good for business in the beginning because it put us on the world map and into people's subconscious.\n\nHowever, this entire situation with the US has raised more concerns because of what we saw in Venezuela. There's way more power behind Trump's words, which has created concerns not only among people in Greenland but the world order.\n\nGeopolitical issues usually have big consequences for tourism in general and for how people spend their money, and we're seeing that at Raw Arctic.\n\nIt's expensive to visit Greenland. Most people aren't booking a quick weekend getaway here, though some do. You can only reach the different cities by sea or by air. It costs at least 200 pounds ($270) per hour just to charter a small boat — though you can reduce the cost per ticket with a larger group — and it takes a lot of time to go from one place to the next.\n\nSome folks are spending their savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to come here. So when there's geopolitical instability, people become more conservative with their money. That's not unique to Greenland, but we feel it very directly right now.\n\nSince the US raid on Venezuela, we've had a lot of people — about 20 to 30 — on standby, saying they're going to wait this out before they make a final decision.\n\nAt the same time, we've continued to grow the business. We've been able to invest in new boats, marketing, and digital solutions.\n\nWe've also expanded beyond being just an operator, running tours directly. We work as an agent across Greenland, partnering with dozens of local guides and operators in smaller coastal settlements.\n\nThat part is important to us. Tourism shouldn't be centralized in the capital. The people who live in these remote areas are the best at showing off their regions, their nature, and their way of life. Giving them a voice and an opportunity is one of our core missions.\n\nFor me personally, the situation with the US has been a mix of feelings. I'm a relatively young guy, and this is my future. It's my time at stake.\n\nOf course, I get concerned about the state of things, but there's some logical part of me that feels secure that the US won't acquire us because it's too big a risk to national relations.\n\nAbout a year ago, I saw a more polarized Greenland with the general elections — one part of Greenland wanted to cut ties with Denmark and achieve rapid independence, and another wanted to stay with Denmark and achieve independence more slowly.\n\nWhen we talk about independence, there are two parts to it. There's one about cultural independence. I think that's what we're achieving at the moment as a people, and that's what the last year has really pushed.\n\nThen there's the economic part. We get about 4 billion Danish crowns ($628 million) a year from the Danish block grant, which stabilizes the Greenlandic economy. I think the economic situation would look different if ties were cut immediately.\n\nWhat I'm now seeing with Trump's interest in the island is a less polarized Greenland. We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?",

    "description": "Real estate investor Grant Cardone said that talks with administration insiders hint at a few things Trump could do next to boost the market.",
    "fullText": "Grant Cardone thinks the Trump administration is gearing up to do more to stimulate the US housing market.\n\nThe longtime real estate investor says he's bullish on housing as the market enters a new year, even as home prices remain high and mortgage rates are elevated.\n\nCardone told Business Insider that he recently spoke with administration insiders about what he thinks can still be done to open up the market to more Americans.\n\nPresident Trump has made affordability a primary focus in 2026 ahead of the midterm elections. In his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, he discussed high housing costs as well as interest rates, stating that the goal of homeownership is out of reach for many Americans.\n\nTrump so far has focused on mortgage rates and housing availability, pitching plans to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac load up on mortgage bonds while also banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\nNext, Cardone thinks Trump could address issues in the tax code to make the market easier to navigate.\n\nHe predicts that the White House will adjust capital gains taxes for home sales to make it less prohibitive to sell a property that has appreciated in value.\n\nCurrently, homeowners can exclude $500,000 in capital gains for married filers or $250,000 for single filers when they sell their home. Cardone expects the caps to be raised, which would make the tax bill much less burdensome and potentially bring more homes to market.\n\nOther commentators have flagged this as a simple fix to the market that can be done with relative ease. Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's Analytics, said last year that the caps should be raised to $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for joint filers.\n\nThe other potential change Trump could make would allow more people to invest in real estate.\n\n\"I think he's going to come out and say, 'hey, I want to extend that bonus depreciation that was approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA),\" Cardone said. \"He's going to extend it to single-family homes.\"\n\n\"Bonus depreciation\" is a mechanism that allows investors to deduct the cost of a property from their taxes. The landmark tax and spending bill signed into law last year allows investors to deduct 100% of qualifying investment properties immediately.\n\n\"When I buy these big assets, I get to write them off basically in year one,\" Cardone explained. \"And when you buy a single-family home, you write it off over 27 years, you get a tax loss spread over that period.\"\n\nCardone thinks this would be significant, as it has never been done in the US and could stimulate more housing market activity by extending buying power to those seeking income-producing properties.\n\nWhile Cardone said his predictions have been informed by talks with administration insiders, a spokesperson denied that any specific policy moves were under discussion.\n\n\"President Trump pledged to put an end to Joe Biden's inflation and affordability crisis, and the Administration is constantly exploring new policy actions to do just that, \"White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told Business Insider. \"Until policy announcements are officially made by the Administration, however, any reporting about potential action is pure speculation.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's ambition to take over Greenland may be on ice for now, but supporters of the Danish territory won't soon forget the affair.\n\nIn particular, Jesper Tønnesen, the Copenhagen shop owner whose MAGA parody hat went viral, told Business Insider he'll continue to raise support for Greenland's right to self-determination.\n\n\"You don't feel that you have any promises, because it can change again,\" he said of Trump's proposed deal with Denmark.\n\nTønnesen's business was thrust into the international spotlight over a red MAGA-style hat he designed late last year in protest of a US takeover of Greenland that read \"Nu det Nuuk,\" a twist on the Danish way of saying \"Now it's enough\" that used the name of Greenland's capital city.\n\nTønnesen said he was inspired by a parody \"Make America Go Away\" hat he had seen earlier, but he felt it was important to make a statement in his native language. The alternate MAGA phrase was also included on a side panel with a Greenland flag.\n\n\"Trump maybe took one step too much,\" he said of the threats to seize the NATO ally's territory. \"We can't communicate with him — we have to say, now it's enough, because we tried.\"\n\nAn initial run of 300 hats didn't get much traction at first, but search interest and copycat products surged last weekend after Trump ramped up his rhetoric over the issue and protesters in Copenhagen and Nuuk took to the streets.\n\nAhead of the protests, Tønnesen and his team made a printed version of the hats to distribute to the crowd, turning the image into an overnight sensation.\n\nE-commerce tracking service JungleScout told Business Insider it has tracked a nearly 900% increase in search volume for the term \"Greenland\" over the past 30 days.\n\nTønnesen said he and his partners are keeping none of the profits from the hats, pledging to donate the money to Greenlandic charities.\n\n\"I have five minutes of fame where I can use this to help Greenland,\" he said. \"That's what it's all about.\"\n\nTrump said this week he has no intention of taking the territory by force and no longer intends to slap tariffs on European countries over the Greenland issue. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump also said an agreement would include \"total access\" for the US.\n\nTønnesen said he has several thousand more hats arriving in the next few days, including a design that says Greenland is \"Already Great.\"\n\nStill, he is aware that the window of public attention can be short.\n\n\"I had the possibility to speak out,\" he said. \"You have to do it when the train is running.\"",

    "fullText": "Jan 22 (Reuters) - General Motors is moving production of a China-built Buick SUV to the U.S., ​its latest move to expand U.S. factory work in the ‌wake of the Trump administration’s tariffs.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said Thursday it is ending China production ‌of the Buick Envision, a midsize SUV that it has been importing to the U.S. for nearly a decade. GM will instead build the next generation of the vehicle at its assembly plant in the Kansas City area ⁠starting in 2028.\n\n“This decision further ‌strengthens GM’s domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs,” the automaker said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nGM has shipped ‍the Envision to the U.S. since 2017 as its only Chinese import. GM has faced a 25% tariff on the vehicles since 2018, and did not win ​an exemption from the tariff during the first Trump administration.\n\nThe Envision ‌became a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.\n\nTariffs on vehicles imported from China increased last year amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing.\n\nLast year, GM announced it would ⁠bring production of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV ​to the same Kansas City-area plant, from ​a factory in Mexico. GM recently began production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt out of the plant for a limited run.\n\nWhen ‍production of the ⁠Bolt ends, GM will convert the plant to make only combustion-engine vehicles.

The ruling from U.S.",
    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”\n\nDuring the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”\n\n“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”\n\nIn his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.\n\n“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment\n\nDuring last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.\n\nAmong the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.\n\nBut in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.\n\nThe decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.\n\nAnother was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nDuring the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country's top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.\n\n“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”\n\nRamya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”\n\n“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at \"unfair, undercut\" prices at which ​Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a ‌U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhile the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required ‌that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.\n\n\"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, ⁠the people of Venezuela will ‌collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price,\" the official said.\n\nChina ‍has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.\n\nThe administration is allowing China to buy the oil at \"fair ​market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices\" at which Maduro sold oil to ‌China to pay debts, the official said.\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.\n\nTrading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and ⁠the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a ​quarter of the $2 billion agreement.\n\nTrafigura completed its first ​crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero ‍and Phillips 66 and ⁠to its refinery in Italy, sources said.\n\nChina's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave ⁠after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Timothy Gardnerin Washington; Additional reporting by Nidhi Verma in New ‌Delhi; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Andrea Ricci )",

    "fullText": "The president wants big tech to pay more for electricity, but he’s curbing renewable projects that could boost supply\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "fullText": "The court’s conservatives appear likely to block trump from firing Lisa Cook—not because they care about principle but because they care about the Fed.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Wednesday in Trump v. Cook, a case that centers on Donald Trump’s illegal attempt to fire Federal Reserve Board commissioner Lisa Cook. The legal arguments should be familiar to anyone who has been watching Trump’s authoritarian takeover of the federal government: Trump claims he has the authority to fire anybody he wants; Cook argues “that’s not how it works, that’s not how any of this works.”\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has generally been game to allow Trump to fire whomever he wants. The court says Trump is entitled to this power under the “Unitary Executive Theory,” a fringe theory that was made up by Republican academics to justify dismantling the regulatory state and that has been adopted by Supreme Court Republicans over the past few years. The theory reimagines every independent agency created by Congress as part of Trump’s personal fiefdom. Based on this view, the Supreme Court has allowed Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board (see Trump v. Wilcox); and it will likely allow him to fire commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (see Trump v. Slaughter. If the theory holds, Trump should be able to fire Cook.\n\nBut here’s the benefit of using a made-up thing like Unitary Executive Theory: The Republicans on the court can make it do whatever they want it to do. While Trump has been busy waving his magic wand and shouting “unitarium executatus!” at the Fed, he’s failed to grasp that the Supreme Court is the author of the entire book of spells. The court can make the spell fizzle out whenever it wants.\n\nUnlike the NLRB and the FTC, Republicans on the court like the Fed. They like its independence. They like what it does. Since Unitary Executive Theory did not exist as a practical thing until Trump decided to take away the independence of all the executive agencies Republicans don’t like, it’s very easy for the Republican justices to say that Unitary Executive Theory doesn’t exist when it comes to the one independent agency they actually care about.\n\nIndeed, Chief Justice John Roberts laid the groundwork for granting the Fed a made-up cloak of protection during the Trump v. Wilcox arguments, which took place after Trump made his first noises about firing Cook. Anticipating her likely firing, Roberts noted that the Fed was a “uniquely structured, quasi-private” independent agency, distinct from all the others. Alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh has made similar statements. This means at least two Republican justices are already poised to allow Trump to run roughshod over every independent agency except the Fed.\n\nWhy? Well, the easy answer is that the Fed has a direct impact on the financial health of the Republicans on the Supreme Court and the donors who’ve bought them. The stability of monetary policy, and its independence from the crazy white supremacist installed in the White House, is important for the stock market, and thus all of the investments rich people have.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that destabilizing the Fed could, without hyperbole, crash the economy. Even beyond the matter of their personal finances, it’s likely that the Republican justices care about that. Remember, before the Roberts court was known as the most pro-authoritarian court in US history, it was widely regarded as the most pro-business court in US history.\n\nPractically speaking, giving Trump personal control over the Fed is bad for business. While the Republicans famously do not care about practicality when it comes to abortion rights or gun rights, when it comes to money? The Republicans care a great deal.\n\nThe majority of the justices’ evident skepticism toward Trump in this case are only really intelligible if you understand both the personal and national implications of the issue in front of the court. The core argument made by the Trump administration was that Cook was fired “for cause,” as is required by statute. The administration claims that the “cause” is an allegation that Cook committed mortgage fraud (she did not) before she was appointed to the Fed. Ostensibly, the justices were arguing over whether this particular alleged fraud is enough of a cause (because not only are the allegations false; they’re allegations over conduct from before she was on the Fed, which is not normally a “for cause” reason to fire somebody from a federal position). The justices were also arguing over whether Cook should have any opportunity to defend herself from these (again, provably false) allegations.\n\nAgain, Trump has fired people based on made-up allegations before. The only reason the court is skeptical about this firing, based on these made-up allegations, is that the ability to fire Fed commissioners at will places the monetary policy of the entire nation at the whim of Trump. We are literally watching Trump trying to push Fed chair Jerome Powell out right now, but he won’t have to push him if the court says the president can just fire Fed officials whenever he wants.\n\nBecause of this, Kavanaugh finally raised the question that he should have raised during every Trump-fires-someone case the court has heard thus far. He asked Solicitor General John Sauer what would stop future presidents from “manufacturing” artificial “cause” to justify firing Fed commissioners whose political positions they don’t like. Sauer said that Trump’s reasons were not manufactured, and that the “for cause” provision protects commissioners from being fired for policy reasons. But everyone knows that the only reason Cook was fired by Trump was policy reasons. Kavanaugh rightly intuited that if Trump can fire Cook, a future Democratic president can just come in and fire all the Trump appointees and install Fed commissioners loyal to the new administration’s monetary policies. Kavanaugh literally quoted himself—from his confirmation hearing, when he threatened retribution on his political enemies—and warned: “What goes around comes around.”\n\nThat’s always been true with these firing cases. Kavanaugh just suddenly cares about it now.\n\nNor is it just Kavanaugh who has suddenly decided to care about the obvious. Here’s what will really shock people who naively think the Republicans on the Supreme Court are committed to their own logic: I think Justice Sam Alito is in play for ruling against Trump. For the first time during Trump’s second reign, he sounded like he was trying to find a way to rule against the president—specifically, to send the case back down to a lower court to have it decide whether the alleged pre-office mortgage fraud was sufficient “cause” for this firing. Roberts and Kavanaugh wanted to end this attack on the Fed now, but Alito (and Ketanji Brown Jackson, to an extent) seemed interested in letting a lower court simply say “this isn’t cause,” as opposed to forcing the Supreme Court to do the dirty work.\n\nThe two justices most aligned with Trump’s position were Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, and that should not be surprising. Say what you will about those two (and I’ve said a lot about how much they suck), those guys are consistent in their belief that the practical consequences of their decisions should be ignored, even when their decisions lead to suffering and death. Thomas and Gorsuch are, like the rest of the justices from both parties, outcome determinative. But in this case, the outcome these two value most is power, not the health of the American economy. If Trump wants to use that power to crash the economy, that’s his problem, not Thomas’s or Gorsuch’s (according to them).\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nStudentNation\n\n /\n\n Colin Warren\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Benjamin R. Barber\n\nStill, they were in the minority. Ultimately, Roberts does not want Trump to have personal control over the Fed, so Trump won’t have it. I also don’t think Roberts wants Trump to be able to impose retaliatory tariffs, so Trump likely won’t have that power either. Roberts does want Trump to be able to kill the NLRB and USAID, so he can. I don’t yet know if Roberts wants Trump to be able to end birthright citizenship, but I guess I’ll find out soon.\n\nI wish Roberts thought immigrants and white ladies in Minnesota were as important as the Federal Reserve. I wish Roberts thought protecting American schoolchildren was as important as protecting American investments. I wish Roberts thought discriminating against a Black woman working at Publix was as important as discriminating against a Black woman working for the Fed. But… he doesn’t.\n\nTrump will lose this case because he’s trying to mess with something the Supreme Court thinks is important. I wish we all could be so lucky as to appear valuable to John Roberts and the Supreme Court.",

    "description": "See how William McKinley's tariff policies that have inspired President Trump's affected everyday Americans in the 1890s.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs have become a defining feature of his second term, central to his strategy for reshaping global trade.\n\nAggressive tariff policies have been rare at the White House in recent decades, but history offers clues about how they can ripple through everyday American life.\n\nThe last time sweeping tariffs were enacted, in the 1890s, it was at the hand of William McKinley, who authored the highly protectionist Tariff Act of 1890, imposing tariffs of more than 50% on many imported goods.\n\nMcKinley, who was the US president from 1897 to 1901, introduced his tariff policies while serving as a congressman. They had far-reaching effects on the economy and were ultimately unpopular among voters, leading him and other Republican congressmen to lose their seats in the 1890 midterms. Even McKinley himself changed his mind on foreign trade by the time he became president.\n\n\"This was protectionist at its height,\" William K. Bolt, a professor of history at Francis Marion University in South Carolina, told Business Insider of McKinley's original policy. \"And there was a significant political backlash against it.\"\n\nTrump has credited McKinley's tariff policies for making America a \"very wealthy country,\" and repeatedly namedropped him on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\n\"In the 1890s, our country was probably the wealthiest it ever was because it was a system of tariffs,\" Trump said in a Michigan town hall in September. \"We had a president, you know McKinley?\"\n\nSince returning to the White House, Trump has pushed an expansive and often unpredictable tariff agenda, from his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs to country-specific threats that have rattled markets and trade partners.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump's desire for the US to buy Greenland has reignited concerns over a potential trade war between the US and its European allies, as Trump threatened eight European nations with a new 10% tariff starting February 1. He has since paused those plans.\n\nOn the other side of the wealth divide, workers and immigrants faced harsh living conditions.\n\nThe rapid increase in industrialization drew masses to America, and immigration, particularly from countries in eastern and southern Europe, changed the face of the workforce, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nChildren, who weren't protected by law from physically challenging labor, had often started contributing to their households by age 10.\n\nIn New York City, the population doubled every decade from 1800 to 1880. Tenement housing, where families packed as many people as possible into apartments by using cheap materials to create walls or add floors to existing buildings, quickly dominated parts of the city. These settlements often lacked indoor plumbing or ventilation, leading to a rapid increase in the spread of illnesses. The cramped conditions also led to many fires in major cities.\n\nJacob Riis' \"How The Other Half Lives,\" a photojournalism book documenting the lives of poor Americans towards the end of the century, exposed the realities faced by millions of people, such as having 12 adults sleeping in 13-feet-wide rooms and child mortality in tenements being as high as one in 10.\n\nAn average family spent nearly 60% of their annual income on food and rent, and laborers — including children — often worked six 10-hour days per week.\n\nOne report of living standards of the time suggested that an average family's dreams would be fulfilled by owning a home valued around $36,000 in today's money, a Sunday dress and suit, a barrel of flour, 5 tons of coal, and $9,000 in today's money in savings.\n\nThe presence of disposable income led to the establishment of department stores and consumerism in the big cities.\n\nFor women entering the workforce, retail stores offered a more respectable field of work than the factory work available to them, which was mostly in textile and garment manufacturing. While job opportunities opened for women, their wages remained significantly lower than men's, who were still seen as the breadwinners of the households, according to the Library of Congress.\n\nPrior to the adoption of the federal income tax in 1913, tariffs were the federal government's main source of funding.\n\nIn an effort to help the economy recover following the Civil War, the government had kept tariffs on foreign goods relatively high compared to pre-war rates, Douglas Irwin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote for the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nHowever, by the late 1880s, a unique problem had arisen: The federal government was taking in too much money from tariffs, resulting in a budget surplus over 40% higher than its spending.\n\nBoth parties agreed to revisit tariff rates in efforts to reduce it, although each side supported a different alternative in what became known as the Great Tariff Debate of 1888.\n\nBorn in 1843 in Niles, Ohio, William McKinley was working as a school teacher when the Civil War broke out in 1861. He enlisted in the Union Army and quickly climbed the ranks. After the war, he attended Albany Law School in New York and began his political career shortly after, being elected to the House of Representatives in 1876.\n\nAuthored by McKinley and later named after him, the Tariff Act of 1890 raised protective tariffs of over 1,500 products by almost 50%.\n\nThe tariff imposed duties on items like tinplate and wool while eliminating tariffs on sugar, molasses, tea, and coffee. The goal of the act was to \"make the duty on foreign-tinplate high enough to insure its manufacture in this country,\" McKinley said in 1890.\n\nIt also protected American workers' wages from competition from cheaper labor abroad.\n\nWhile miners and farmers of crops like corn, wheat, and potatoes benefited from the stimulus to American production and the rise in foreign competitors' prices, some manufacturing was hurt by the price hikes in raw materials.\n\nThe tariffs affected consumer products like shoes, clothes, and canned goods, as well as some other 1,500 products, ranging from chemicals and metals to dairy products and grains, to varying degrees.\n\nUltimately, it was everyday people who ended up paying the price for the tariffs, Bolt said.\n\n\"Consumers had to pay a higher price for the manufactured good they wanted,\" Bolt said. \"So there was in fact a political backlash against the McKinley tariff.\"\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Tariff Act, McKinley's Republican Party lost control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1890, and the Ohio representative himself was ousted as the party lost 93 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOver the next two years, as voters continued to feel the impacts of the measure and other economic instabilities, the party also lost the presidential election and both chambers of Congress in 1892.\n\nAcross the country, economic unrest as prices rose turned workers against vendors and employers, leading to a rise in the labor movement.\n\nAs industries expanded, workers began to unite against industry barons to demand fair work conditions.\n\nAn 1892 strike demanding improvements in working conditions turned deadly after Carnegie Steel-hired security forces exchanged gunfire with the worker coalition.\n\nAcross the country, labor movements gained momentum, with the rising hostility between industry leaders and workers ending in fatal incidents.\n\nIn 1894, the Pullman Strike, after which Labor Day was established, led to dozens of deaths and millions of dollars in damages, pushing then-President Grover Cleveland to legitimize the labor movement by declaring the national holiday.\n\nThe rise in unemployment (which reached 17% by the winter and surpassed 10% for the next half of the decade), along with government spending on Civil War pensions, were some of the factors that contributed to the panic.\n\nFollowing the panic, the Democrats reduced some of McKinley's tariffs with the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act of 1894. Tariffs on some items — including iron ore, lumber, and wool — were nixed entirely, angering US producers of those products.\n\nFollowing the economic troubles, voters blamed President Grover Cleveland and his Democratic party, which didn't regain power in any branch of government until 1910.\n\nShortly after ending his term as governor of Ohio, serving from 1892 to 1896, McKinley ran for president on a protectionist platform that aimed to benefit American industries while discouraging trade with foreign nations.\n\n\"Free trade gives to the foreign producer equal privileges with us,\" McKinley proclaimed in a 1892 speech. \"It destroys our factories or reduces our labor to the level of theirs.\"\n\nMcKinley's tariff plans heavily targeted the import of goods like tinplate, wool, yarn, steel, and sugar in an effort to encourage domestic manufacturing.\n\nWith domestic industries continuing to grow thanks to widespread industrialization and an increase in goods production, American manufacturers saw a need for exports to an international market.\n\nHowever, America's tariffs on foreign imports led other nations to increase their duties on American products, limiting the domestic industries' role in foreign trade and hurting the economy as a surplus of production failed to bring in more revenue for manufacturers.\n\nOnce in the White House, President McKinley's approach to tariffs turned to a reciprocal view that would help export American products and stimulate trade rather than penalize it.\n\nStaying true to his election promise of high tariffs, McKinley supported the Dingley Tariff Act, which raised previously lowered tariffs back to an average of 49% on imported goods, according to Lewis L. Gould, a professor of American history at the University of Texas. However, the act also granted the president the power to negotiate tariff reductions up to 20% or add products to a tariff \"free-list.\"\n\nUsing the tariffs as a negotiating tool with foreign markets, McKinley encouraged nations to lower their tariffs on American goods to allow for more exports.\n\nMajor donations from executives from firms like JP Morgan and Standard Oil ensured that the McKinley presidency remained friendly to business interests.\n\nMcKinley was also in office for part of the Great Merger wave of 1895-1904, in which companies consolidated into larger firms, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Between 1895 and 1904, the average number of firms disappearing to mergers each year was 301; in 1899 alone, as merger activity peaked, this number rose to 1,028, per the NBER.\n\nWhile the Sherman Antitrust Act — a federal law prohibiting businesses from engaging in unfair practices that restrain competition — was passed in 1890, it is understood that the McKinley administration failed to strictly enforce the law to prevent large firms from consolidating into even larger monopolies during this period.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, one out of every eight children was employed by 1870. By 1900, the rate had risen to one in every five, with almost two million kids aged 10 to 15 working full-time jobs.\n\nIn rural areas, young boys (some even younger than 14) often worked at coal mines, breaking up coal with their bare hands or performing farm labor. In cities, many earned an income through newspaper delivery. In towns, both boys and girls often worked at mills or factories.\n\nThe unregulated growth of large firms led to more workers getting involved with the labor movement. Between 1897 and 1904, union membership increased from less than 500,000 to over two million workers, according to the US Department of Labor.\n\nWorkers united to demand fair working conditions, like improved facilities and hours. At the time, the norm for a worker was to work over 10 hours a day in places like factories or mills that exposed them to dangerous chemicals and conditions.\n\nAs the labor movement gained support, tensions between workers and businesses grew more hostile. One 1897 encounter between coal miners and local authorities, which later became known as the Lattimer Massacre, resulted in the death of 19 strikers.\n\nSent to Havana Harbor during the Cuban War of Independence against the Spanish, the USS Maine and its accidental explosion set the stage for America's declaration of war with Spain.\n\nUnverified reports of a Spanish attack on the ship alarmed Americans and quickly built support for the war, which Americans saw as a just cause for Cuban freedom.\n\nOn the night after the explosion alone, the Army received over 100,000 volunteers.\n\nThe Spanish-American war was perhaps the most significant development of the McKinley administration, and might've contributed to the president's shift in tone regarding foreign trade towards the end of his presidency.\n\nThe Spanish-American war greatly expanded America's reach in the hemisphere and beyond.\n\nThe 16-week war and low casualties on the American front helped raise the national spirit following the economic and political instability of the past century.\n\nAmerica's victory in the Spanish-American War and the subsequent annexation of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam ended America's isolationist approach of the 19th century in favor of a globalist view, which was then reflected in the domestic politics adopted by McKinley's leadership.\n\nVictory in the war effectively turned a page in American politics as the country was now emboldened by its newly found global power.\n\nIn a drastic change in views since his Congress days, McKinley openly discouraged the protectionist economy in favor of reciprocal tariffs, saying that \"a policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals.\"\n\nHis speech at the Pan-American Exposition signaled a shift in the Republican Party's views of trade following the war, and opened the door for an expansionist economy.\n\nWhile attending the event, the president was shot by Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American laborer and anarchist. He died from the wounds eight days later, on September 14, 1901.\n\nDespite the economic turmoil of the previous decade, McKinley was widely mourned by the country.\n\n\"It's a great \"what-if\" in American politics,\" Bolt said. \"If McKinley wasn't assassinated, [would] we [have started] to move towards free trade a lot earlier than we did?\"\n\nFollowing McKinley's death, his successor, President Theodore Roosevelt, and subsequent Progressive politics brought upon changes that alleviated the social and economic tensions of the Gilded Age.\n\nPower shifted from the barons and reforms in labor, trust busting, tax policies, and civil rights changed the landscape of American life.\n\nWhile McKinley's presidency is often overshadowed by his successor's, he had a significant impact on setting the stage for a new age in the domestic economy, both through his protectionist tariffs and his undoing of them.",

    "title": "Trump called Greenland a 'piece of ice.' To Greenlanders, it's so much more.",
    "description": "President Donald Trump repeatedly called Greenland a \"piece of ice\" while speaking at Davos. Three Greenlanders gave Business Insider their responses.",
    "fullText": "For over 56,000 people, Greenland is far more than a \"piece of ice\" — it's home.\n\nThat's what three residents of Greenland told Business Insider on Wednesday after President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the island as a \"piece of ice\" and called it \"Iceland\" on several occasions during a speech to World Economic Forum attendees at the Davos Conference.\n\nOn one occasion, Trump took a more complimentary tone and referred to the autonomous territory of Denmark as a \"big, beautiful piece of ice.\" He added that the US \"alone can defend this giant piece of ice,\" calling it a \"core national security interest.\"\n\nTrump isn't the first US president to want to acquire Greenland. In fact, the US has been discussing it since the 19th century. However, residents across Greenland — in the south, the north, and the capital — told Business Insider they don't appreciate Trump's rhetoric.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\n\"Just calling Greenland a 'piece of ice' is so inaccurate,\" 32-year-old Ole Olsvig told Business Insider. Olsvig, an entrepreneur and tourist guide in Qaarsut in North Greenland, called the rhetoric \"outrageous,\" \"disrespectful,\" and \"commoditizing.\"\n\nTechnically, about 80% of Greenland is covered by a giant ice sheet. That's not what concerns Olsvig, though; it's what the remarks imply.\n\nIt erases people and implies disposability, he said. \"Greenland is like being treated as an asset, not a society of people.\"\n\nTrump has spoken of acquiring Greenland since his first presidential term. In his Davos speech on Wednesday, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" about the US taking control of Greenland, saying, \"We need it for strategic, national security, and international security.\"\n\n\"We're not for sale,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer who lives in Qassiarsuk in South Greenland, told Business Insider.\n\nShe added that she thinks Trump wants Greenland for more than just national security reasons — he also wants access to Greenland's trove of natural resources.\n\n\"We have very strict rules in the mining industry, which is good. So even though he really wants to buy Greenland, it's not just like a place he can just buy and then make a mine,\" she said.\n\nAnother point of contention among Greenlanders is that Trump's portrayal of Greenland as a \"piece of ice\" ignores the territory's rich and distinct culture.\n\nGreenland has its own official language, self-governance, and cultural practices, including hunting, fishing, and sled dogs, Olsvig said. \"Greenland isn't just a blank map.\"\n\nKleist added, \"We're not becoming part of America,\" despite Trump's wishes.\n\nThe attention Greenland has gotten on the world stage has had some positive effects, said 28-year-old Casper Frank Møller, the CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, which is based in Nuuk.\n\nFor example, his company saw a surge in interest from tourists at the start of 2025 when Trump re-raised the topic of acquiring Greenland.\n\nHowever, Møller said that the US's raid on Venezuela has caused further concerns among people in Greenland because \"there was just way more power behind the words.\" He estimates that 20 to 30 customers have postponed travel plans to Greenland as they wait out the situation.\n\nHe added that Trump's aggressive approach toward Greenland has actually made the country a little less polarized and more united toward potential independence.\n\n\"We don't want to be American. We don't want to be Danish. We want to be Greenlandic. The question is just, when should we cut the ties?\" he said.\n\n\"We as Greenlandic people, we are democratic, we aim for diplomacy, and we don't want any warfare to be happening here in Greenland. We're looking for diplomatic solutions,\" he added.\n\nMøller, for one, seemed to see some truth in the description of Greenland as a \"piece of ice.\"\n\n\"Greenland for sure has an immense, abnormally big piece of ice in the ice sheet,\" he said. \"It's true.\"\n\nThat said, \"we have some of the most beautiful places on Earth. Some of the most remote, untouched areas that you can imagine,\" he added. \"And I would say, for that big chunk of ice, that's what we call home.\"",

    "title": "Student-loan forgiveness for public servants is at risk under Trump's plan to ax cheaper monthly payments, Democratic lawmakers say",
    "description": "Trump agreed to a settlement that would end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan. Lawmakers raised concerns about pushing borrowers off too soon.",
    "fullText": "Millions of student-loan borrowers could soon be forced off a key repayment plan — and debt relief is on the line.\n\nOn Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Tim Kaine, led their colleagues in raising concerns regarding the Department of Education's proposed settlement to end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan.\n\nOver 7 million borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, which was created by former President Joe Biden and intended to give borrowers cheaper monthly payments with a shorter timeline to loan forgiveness. Litigation halted the plan in 2024, and President Donald Trump's administration recently announced a proposed settlement that would effectively eliminate the plan and require borrowers to transfer to an existing plan with higher payments.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for eliminating SAVE by 2028, and this settlement would accelerate that timeline. The lawmakers wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that borrowers are likely to face \"significant hurdles\" switching to a new plan, and those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program — which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years — are at heightened risk.\n\n\"Forcing these borrowers to transition out of SAVE with little guidance risks further lost time to debt relief and payment increases that could render continued public service untenable,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nBorrowers have not received credit toward PSLF while on the SAVE forbearance. While resuming payments on a different income-driven repayment plan would count toward PSLF, the lawmakers wrote that transitioning millions of borrowers to a new plan in a short timeframe would be a significant administrative burden, and they requested that the Department of Education give borrowers at least six months to switch to a new plan before their next payment comes due.\n\nThe department wrote in its press release that SAVE borrowers \"will have a limited time\" to select a new repayment plan. Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement at the time that \"American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.\"\n\nA slew of changes is on the horizon for student-loan borrowers. While borrowers are still waiting for a court to approve the SAVE settlement, provisions of Trump's spending legislation — including new repayment plans and borrowing caps — are set to be rolled out beginning in July.\n\nThose changes come as over 5 million borrowers are in default on their student loans, following the Trump administration's resumption of collections in May 2025 after a five-year pause. The Education Department announced last week that it is temporarily pausing wage garnishment and tax refund seizures for defaulted borrowers. Still, Democratic lawmakers said in their letter that SAVE borrowers are at risk of defaulting should they face challenges transitioning to a new plan.\n\n\"It is imperative the Department take every action possible to ensure the 7 million borrowers currently enrolled in SAVE are provided with the information and resources necessary to avoid delinquency or default in order to avoid an even bigger default crisis,\" they wrote.",

China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.\n\nThe UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.\n\nBut launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.\n\nTrump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\n\n\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"\n\nTrump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\".\n\n\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nPresident Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.\n\nBut the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.\n\nPutin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nLive: World leaders sign Trump's Board of Peace papers\n\nTrump to meet Zelensky as US envoy says ending war with Russia down to one issue\n\nPutin invited to join US-led Gaza 'Board of Peace', Trump says\n\nWho is on Trump's 'Board of Peace' overseeing Gaza's reconstruction?\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\n\n\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.\n\nBut she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\n\n\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"\n\nShe said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\n\n\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.\n\nDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.\n\nBut Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.\n\nCooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.\n\nBut when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.\n\nAs talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.\n\nTrump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.\n\nBut the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.\n\nThe text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".\n\nThe leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.\n\nThe charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.\n\nLast Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nMore have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.\n\nThe Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) traded higher on Thursday as global risk sentiment improved after US President Donald Trump walked back his plan to impose new tariffs on European allies amid his push to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation (BTC-USD) rose about 1% over the past 24 hours to hover near $90,000 (£66,902), moving in tandem with equities in Asia and Europe. The broader cryptocurrency market cap climbed 2.7% to $3.18tn over the same period, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signalled a diplomatic shift on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying he would not pursue military action to acquire Greenland and had reached “the framework of a future deal” on the Danish territory with NATO allies.\n\nThe remarks injected fresh volatility into crypto markets. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to an intraday low near $87,300 before rebounding back toward $90,000 as traders reassessed US trade policy risks and broader macro conditions. More than $625m in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated over 24 hours, split roughly evenly between longs and shorts across about 150,000 traders, according to Coinglass market data.\n\nAnalysts said the episode underscored how digital assets are reacting more directly to geopolitical and macro headlines.\n\n“Today’s sharp price swings highlight how closely crypto markets are tracking geopolitical and policy developments,” said Rachel Lin, CEO of SynFutures, noting that Trump’s signals on Greenland negotiations and a pause on potential EU tariffs “briefly improved global risk sentiment, prompting a rapid rebound in bitcoin alongside US equities”.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance UK, Lin added that while the move was headline-driven, “they reflect a deeper shift in market structure”, describing bitcoin (BTC-USD) as “increasingly behaving like a macro asset, reacting to changes in policy expectations and broader risk appetite”.\n\nOver the longer term, she said, institutional participation is supporting bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) evolution as “a maturing and globally relevant asset class, even amid elevated volatility”.\n\nGlobal equities rallied as Trump withdrew his threat to impose additional 10% tariffs on eight European countries, including the UK, after receiving what he called the “framework of a future deal” in NATO discussions regarding Greenland.\n\nIn Asia, Japan’s Nikkei gained nearly 2%, while South Korea’s Kospi broke above the 5,000 level for the first time. European markets opened higher, with the FTSE 100 up 0.7% at the open.",

    "description": "\"Let's talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around.\"",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday regarding President Donald Trump’s move to fire Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa D. Cook, with whom the court appeared likely to side.\n\nThe New York Times’s Ann E. Marimow summed up the arguments before the court and reported that “justices from across the ideological spectrum questioned whether the allegations President Trump lodged against Ms. Cook — an unproven assertion that she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office — were serious enough to allow the president to fire her.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered some of the most skeptical questions to Trump Solicitor General D. John Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh went so far during his questioning to suggest that if the court found in Trump’s favor, it would mean the president could fire all independent agency officials “at-will” – ending the “for cause” legal requirement.\n\nKavanaugh argued “the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s a Democrat president…then we’re really at-will removal.”\n\nBelow is a transcript of that exchange:\n\nKavanaugh: For present purposes, you accept the constitutionality of the for-cause removal provision for the Federal Reserve, and that is what protects the independence of the Federal Reserve. What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?\n\nSauer: It protects the governors. Exactly reflecting the plain text of the statute, it protects the governors from removal for policy disagreement or for no reason at all.\n\nKavanaugh: What is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: To preserve the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nKavanaugh: And what is the broader purpose of that?\n\nSauer: Well, there are a number of reasons that are discussed by the amici, and I think not disputed by us, which is that there is, you know, a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of, you know, executive influence, and we don’t dispute that that’s what Congress was doing in that statute. And again, we are not disputing the validity of the for-cause removal restriction here.\n\nKavanaugh: And why is that independence important in your view?\n\nSauer: We don’t dispute the importance of that for many of the reasons that the amici say, but we emphasize that there’s a balance struck here. This is not an ironclad “you can never be removed.” There is a cause removal authorization.\n\nKavanaugh: But on that, in your position that there’s no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines—that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve that we just discussed.\n Sauer: We disagree with that, and I would point to the point you made that this is a low bar for cause. In a sense, it’s a very high bar.\n\nIt is a very strong protection, because it does protect them from the one thing that Congress was apparently most worried about, which is—\n Kavanaugh: But it would be in the view of the president—the president who might have a policy disagreement—and there’s no judicial review, and the president can just define it on his or her own.\n\nSauer: One of the strongest traditions in this court’s jurisprudence is the sort of presumption of regularity to the president’s actions that has applied to this provision, I think, effectively for 112 years, and it continues to do so.\n\nKavanaugh: Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me, just thinking big picture, what goes around comes around. All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there’s a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033. And then we’re really at at-will removal. So what are we doing here? What is—you know, we started—that’s why I started with what’s the purpose of the independence and the for-cause removal. If we accept all these—no procedure, no judicial review, no remedy—you know, that’s what’s going to happen, I think. And then where are we? So do you dispute that that is, you know, the real-world effect?\n\nSauer: I can’t predict what future presidents may or may not do, but the argument strikes me as a policy argument.\n\nKavanaugh: Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around. And I think that’s what we have to make sure we’re—again, that can’t drive the decision necessarily. We have to be aware of what we’re doing and the consequences of your position for the structure of the government.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Kavanaugh Warns ‘What Goes Around Comes Around’ If Court Lets Trump Have ‘At-Will Removal’ Power first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Trump is set to scale back international travel to focus on upcoming midterm elections after an Air Force One malfunction curtailed his sleep as he jetted into Davos.\n\nThe decision was relayed to reporters aboard the aircraft heading to Zurich on Wednesday, and news of it came after an electrical issue on board forced the plane to circle back to Washington, D.C. This ate into the president’s schedule and whittled away the notoriously light sleeper’s opportunity for some shut-eye.\n\nThe president swapped planes back in the capital and continued his journey, heavily delayed, to Switzerland. His second departure, just after midnight, is thought to have added a further three hours to his journey.\n\nTrump, 79, emerged from the second plane in Zurich on Wednesday morning looking frazzled, before slowly descending the stairs. Despite the setback, the president still made it in time to address world leaders in Davos, though his voice sounded hoarse and he appeared to have bags under his eyes.\n\nCNN White House Correspondent Alayna Treene reported that her colleague, frequent Trump target Kaitlan Collins, said his Chief of Staff Susie Wiles relayed the message that the president would be moving away from international travel to tour U.S. cities ahead of November midterms.\n\nWiles told the press pool that Trump’s new intinerary will begin in Iowa on Tuesday, where the president will give a speech on the economy. He will then visit a new destination “every week,” Bloomberg reported, citing Wiles.\n\nIt’s part of an attempt to reverse poor marks on affordability, a main concern of voters that Trump has sought to dismiss as a “hoax” cooked up by Democrats.\n\nTrump’s domestic charm offensive kicked off in Michigan last week. He toured Ford’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn on Tuesday afternoon before delivering a speech at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nHowever, it got off to a contentious start as Trump appeared to flip off a person heard calling him a “pedophile protector” during his visit to the vehicle plant. According to footage of the confrontation, Trump appeared to point at the accuser as he said, “f*** you,” and then gave the person the middle finger as he walked away.\n\nThat followed another speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, last month, where Trump rambled about the brazen U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and called the affordability issue a “hoax” twice.\n\nHis focus frustrated senior White House officials and Republican lawmakers who want the administration to emphasize economic and healthcare concerns, three people familiar with internal discussions told Reuters.\n\nThe White House has been asked to comment on Trump’s revamped travel schedule.",

    "description": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.",
    "fullText": "CNN commentator Maggie Haberman said that the Greenland arrangement being discussed by President Donald Trump and European leaders seems to be one that already exists.\n\nTrump spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday after he spent weeks demanding that Denmark hand over Greenland. The president cited “national security” reasons even though a 1951 treaty allows the U.S. to expand its military presence on the island, where it already maintains a base.\n\nIn his address, Trump said he wants “right, title, and ownership” of the territory. Afterward, the president announced he and European leaders had arrived at a “framework” and a “concept of a deal” regarding Greenland. He gave no specifics, but conservative commentators hailed the mystery agreement as the stuff of a modern-day Metternich.\n\nOn Wednesday’s AC360, Haberman said signs indicate that the deal in question is “something that is already in existence.”\n\n“So, Maggie, is it clear to you what, if anything, President Trump is getting from Denmark in Greenland that the U.S. doesn’t already have de facto control over?” Anderson Cooper asked.\n\n“No. And look, Anderson, we don’t know the answers to these questions,” Haberman replied. “There’s a lot left unsaid. The president didn’t answer this.”\n\nHaberman went on to say that based on what little information has been provided about the “framework,” it appears to be a reflection of the preexisting arrangement among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland.\n\n“As of now, based on what they’re talking about, it looks as if they’re talking about something that is already in existence,” she continued. “And in fact, the U.S. used to have a greater military presence in Greenland. It got scaled back after the Cold War.”\n\nShe noted that in his Davos speech, Trump maligned NATO and questioned if it would ever come to the defense of the U.S. In fact, the only time NATO’s collective defense provision was invoked was on behalf of the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\n“Article 5 [of the NATO treaty] was invoked once, and it was after 9/11,” Haberman said. “And someone who is from New York, it’s surprising that they don’t recall that. And so, he is speaking about this completely in transactional terms. And you can see that this is not over. I understand that [NATO Secretary-General] Mark Rutte is trying to calm things down, but European leaders are still very alarmed. And leaders in Denmark have been very alarmed for weeks and weeks now before this really became much more public.”\n\nThe post Maggie Haberman Says Trump’s Greenland ‘Deal’ Appears To Be ‘Something That Is Already in Existence’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump had a change of heart on tariffs after meeting with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, where he shared an anecdote about his decision to lower the tariff rate on Swiss imports from the 39% he proposed in July. He said meetings with Swiss businesses, including watchmaker Rolex, influenced the decision.\n\nTrump said, \"all hell really broke out\" after he proposed the tariff rate.\n\n\"I was paid visits by everybody,\" he said. \"Rolex came to see me.\"\n\nTrump said that watch brands like Rolex had contributed to a trade deficit with Switzerland.\n\n\"But I realised, and I reduced it because I don't want to hurt people,\" he said of the tariff rate.\n\nAs it stands, there's a 15% cap on the tariff rate for Swiss imports.\n\nHowever, that rate could change again, Trump said. He said he initially planned a 30% tariff on Switzerland, then raised it to 39%, before lowering it to 15%.\n\n\"We brought it down to a lower level. Doesn't mean it's not going up, but we brought it down to a lower level,\" Trump said.\n\nSome US watch sellers have said higher tariff rates could lead Swiss watchmakers to raise prices, which could affect consumers.\n\nRolex didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSwiss business leaders met with Trump last year to discuss the tariffs, and Rolex left him with a desk clock modeled after one of its iconic watches, watch publication Hodinkee reported.\n\nTrump had kind words for Swiss watchmakers at Davos.\n\n\"They make beautiful watches, great watches, Rolex, all of them,\" he said.",

    "description": "From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump touted his affordability agenda at Davos. The numbers are a mixed bag.",
    "fullText": "America's economy has never been stronger.\n\nAt least that's what President Donald Trump told the Davos audience on Wednesday. From gasoline and housing, to healthcare and credit cards, Trump framed his economic agenda as one centered on affordability.\n\nTrump repeatedly credited his policies for lowering everyday costs, and promised more savings in the future. But the reality is slightly different.\n\nAs Americans navigate a brutal job market and climbing cost of living, Business Insider dove into the data behind the president's Davos speech.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The price of gasoline is now below $2.50 a gallon in many states… Soon it will be averaging less than $2 a gallon.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The average price of gasoline in the US was $2.81 a gallon as of January 19, nearly half of what it was during a 2022 high. Gas prices haven't been below $2 since the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs of January 21, AAA reported that ten states have an average gas price at or below $2.50.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Homes are built for people, not corporations. America will not become a nation of renters. We're not going to do that. That's why I've signed an order banning large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump signed an executive order targeting institutional investors this month — but it's unlikely to have a notable impact on housing affordability. These investors only own 2 or 3% of family rental properties in the US, largely in Southern and Sun Belt cities.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgage rates have been trending downward over the past year, though they remain relatively high. Average rent prices have seen consistent, steep growth over the last five years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The cost of prescription drugs is coming down by up to 90%.\"\n\nWhat's happening: The president is negotiating with some pharmaceutical companies to lower the cost of drugs and has launched TrumpRx, a government-run, direct-to-consumer prescription platform aimed at connecting people with cheaper medications. Trump's healthcare plan, released last week, outlines the administration's goals to lower drug prices and insurance premiums while maximizing transparency for Americans.\n\nEnhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expired in December because of Republican opposition in Congress, leading to a spike in premiums for millions of Americans on marketplace plans. January data shows that, with rising costs, at least 1.4 million Americans dropped their healthcare plans between 2025 and 2026.\n\nWhite House Spokesperson Kush Desai told Business Insider that the enrollment decline is \"entirely a result of the Trump administration's commonsense measures to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and remove people who were improperly enrolled on highly-subsidized ACA plans.\"\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act also proposed changes to Medicaid, including stricter work requirements for enrollees and a federal funding reduction of $1 trillion over the next ten years.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\"\n\nWhat's happening: Trump has called on Congress to cap credit card rates that have \"ripped off\" consumers. In the third quarter of 2025, the most recently available data, American credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nThis proposal has received bipartisan support, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders pushing for a similar credit card cap. \"Trump even acknowledge the bipartisan appeal, telling CNBC's Joe Kernen Wednesday that the proposal sounds like something \"the mayor of New York maybe came up with.\"\n\nBank and business leaders are largely opposed, arguing that a 10% cap would prevent companies from adequately pricing subprime credit risk.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump knows he's aligning himself with the progressive left when it comes to credit cards.\n\nDuring an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen in Davos on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that his call for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates isn't a standard conservative policy.\n\nIn fact, he joked that it's something that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, might have come up with.\n\n\"I know it's sort of like… it sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that,\" Trump said with a laugh.\n\nFollowing Mamdani's election in November, the two met in the Oval Office and appeared to share some common ground in remarks to the press afterwards.\n\n\"I'm conservative, but I think I'm common sense, you know?\" Trump said on Wednesday. \"People say, 'Are you a conservative?' I say, 'Yeah, but I'm a common-sense person.' I mean, I do things that aren't necessarily that conservative sometimes.\"\n\nTrump said he respected credit card companies but that consumers can't afford to pay high rates.\n\n\"Whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" Trump said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump called on Congress to pass a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year.\n\nKey Republicans in Congress have been cool to that idea, with House Speaker Mike Johnson telling reporters last week that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy and that credit card companies may \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nMany business leaders have also been critical of the idea.\n\nYet Trump's call has also been met with agreement from some progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom Trump called last week.\n\nIn Congress, Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill that would do just what Trump said, capping credit card rates at 10% for a year.",

    "fullText": "If President Donald Trump gets his way on credit cards, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon predicts chaos — but more on the streets of American towns than in the walls of his own bank.\n\n\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said when asked about President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest rates. \"And I'm not making that up because of our business, we would survive it, by the way. In the worst case, you would have to have a drastic reduction of the credit card business.\"\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon predicted that, if enacted, the cap could strip credit from 80% of Americans. Dimon proposed that the government test the proposal by forcing all the banks in Vermont and Massachusetts to comply, \"and then see what happens,\" causing a ripple of laughter through the audience.\n\n\"The people crying most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said, adding that those hurt will include restaurants, retailers, travel companies, and municipalities, \"because people will miss their water payments.\"\n\nWhatever the president and Congress decide, JPMorgan will \"deal with it,\" Dimon said. He promised that the bank would provide more extensive analysis of the potential effects, and said that he, too, wants greater affordability.\n\nDimon struck a largely conciliatory tone when asked about some of Trump's geopolitical moves — immigration and NATO, for example — which he called \"more qualitative, how it's going to work, what are the pieces, what's their intent.\" But he said he understands the card issue deeply and has a responsibility, of sorts, to speak up.\n\nDimon, like many other big-bank CEOs and business leaders, has previously said that reducing card interest rates could harm customers with lower credit scores. JPMorgan's CFO warned during the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call last week that enacting price controls could \"make it no longer a good business.\"",

Trump made the tariff threats after those countries sent troops to Greenland earlier in January.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said he will levy a new 10% tariff in February on imports from those countries, set to jump to 25% in June \"to protect Global Peace and Security\" because these countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown\" and \"have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\" Trump added that the tariffs will be in effect until a deal to buy Greenland is reached.\n\nThat new round of tariffs could affect a slew of goods, with medicine and cars leading the way. The US imported a total of $365 billion in goods from the eight targeted countries in 2024. That included about $44 billion in pharmaceutical preparations and nearly $40 billion in new or used passenger cars. Some other main imports included aircraft, industrial engines, and toiletries and cosmetics.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the US acquire Greenland, but said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that he won't use force to do so.\n\n\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable, but I won't do that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump briefly addressed high housing costs and interest rates in his Davos speech but did not get into specifics.",
    "fullText": "After making his case to acquire Greenland, President Donald Trump celebrated his own achievements and elaborated on his plans to address the high cost of housing in the US during his hourlong speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.\n\n\"Homeownership has always been a symbol of health and vigor of American society, but that goal fell out of reach for millions and millions of people in the Biden era because interest rates went up so high,\" Trump said. \"Today, I'm taking action to bring back this bedrock of the American dream.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's proposals have included banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes, purchasing $200 billion of mortgage debt to reduce mortgage interest rates, introducing 50-year mortgages and portable home loans, and allowing homebuyers to use their 401(k)s to make a down payment.\n\n\"In 2024, the US built less than two million new homes,\" Trump said, adding that Biden admitted eight million new migrants. \"Those days are over.\"\n\nBut industry watchers and housing policy researchers say the fundamental driver of high housing costs is a shortage of homes — and there isn't a quick fix. Building enough housing to accommodate demand in markets across the US will take many years and require significant action on the state and local levels.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Tuesday cracking down on major investors in homes and asked Congress to pass legislation banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying houses.\n\n\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations, and America will not become a nation of renters,\" Trump said in Davos.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nBut these mega landlords own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, they've slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. The evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\nJenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, previously told Business Insider that the lack of homes in markets across the country is \"number one, two, and three on the list of problems.\" She called a potential ban \"a red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nIn Truth Social posts earlier this month, Trump announced that he had ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds to drive down mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates have since fallen. But industry experts said the impact of the move would likely be somewhat short-term and overshadowed by the ongoing housing shortage and moves by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump didn't provide further details on a plan at Davos, which was teased last week, that would enable Americans to pull from their 401(k)s to make a down payment on a home.\n\nThe proposal was first announced by Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Fox Business last week. \"Suppose that you put 10% down on a home, and then you take 10% of the equity of the home and put it in as an asset in your 401(k). Then your 401(k) will grow over time,\" Hassett told the network.\n\nMona Mahajan, head of investment strategy at Edward Jones, said at the time that the plan may be a good step in the right direction if it gets people thinking about diversifying their asset classes and investing earlier in their careers and home ownership journeys.\n\nUnder current tax code rules, first-time homebuyers have to pay a 10% penalty on withdrawing money before the age of 59 ½ from a 401(k) for a home purchase, with the exception of hardship withdrawals or disability reasons. Over the past few years, Congress has allowed people subject to natural disasters and terminal illnesses to withdraw money from their 401(k)s without penalties.\n\nFor IRAs, they can draw up to $10,000 penalty-free but have to pay income tax.\n\nFinancial experts often discourage people from taking out 401(k) loans for reasons such as a home purchase, as doing so could lead to lost growth opportunities, though workers who do so pay themselves with interest.\n\nIt's unclear whether this plan could have legs in Congress, as it would likely require changes to the tax code.\n\nAnother set of ideas that Trump didn't expand on in Davos involves changes to mortgages themselves.\n\nIn November 2025, Trump and the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, said the administration was exploring a 50-year mortgage option and ways buyers can lock in low interest rates from older mortgages.\n\nThe idea of a half-century-old mortgage has been widely criticized by housing economists, who argue that while 50-year loans would mean lower monthly payments, they would entail much higher interest costs for homeowners over the life of the loan and a much longer road to building equity.\n\nPulte also said the administration was \"actively evaluating\" so-called portable mortgages. These loans would enable homeowners to take their mortgage interest rate with them to a new property.\n\nHousing economists warn that legalizing portable loans could give homeowners who are lucky enough to have an existing mortgage with a low rate an even bigger advantage over first-time homebuyers and others. The dynamic could also drive home prices up by empowering repeat buyers to spend more.\n\n\"Financing is not the solution,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, previously told Business Insider. \"We're in this affordability crisis because there's a housing shortage, so changing the loan terms, having different financing products — it doesn't change the fact there aren't enough homes to go around.\"",

    "fullText": "The \"Sell America\" trade could get worse if global investors are further shaken by Donald Trump's latest tariff threats.\n\nKatie Koch, a former partner at Goldman Sachs and the CEO of the $200 billion asset manager TCW Group, said she thinks investors could be on the verge of \"quiet quitting\" the US bond market.\n\nThat's because many foreign investors feel they're overexposed to the US and are wary of some of the President's new policies — like Trump's threat to slap a 10% tariff on European nations if Greenland isn't up for sale within the next few weeks, she suggested, citing her conversations with other asset managers at the World Economic Forum.\n\nThe shift away from the US could happen quietly, Koch said, as investors looking to unwind their positions won't \"scream it from the rooftops.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to see some quiet quitting of the US bond market, and that I'm worried about,\" Koch said, speaking to CNBC on the sidelines at Davos Tuesday. \"I expect that investors will continue to look to diversify,\" she later added.\n\n\"Sell America\" has been a lingering concern for investors over the past year as markets have taken in Trump's ambitious tariff and geopolitical plans. The worry is that policy uncertainty and fears of higher inflation and rising deficits could cause more investors to dump US assets, a move that, in the bond market, could cause rates to rise as a higher yield is needed to entice investors.\n\nMarkets already saw a \"Sell USA\" day on Tuesday, Koch said, referring to the steep sell-off in US equities and government bonds as investors sought to reduce their exposure to the US. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield, a reflection of long-term interest rates in the economy, jumped 5 basis points.\n\nBonds from countries like Japan, Europe, and various emerging markets now look more attractive for bond investors than US Treasurys, Koch added.\n\nOther market commentators have their eye on how the bond market could react to Trump's policy changes. Bond vigilantes — investors who protest what they see as negative developments in the market by selling Treasurys to drive up yields — threw a major tantrum about the president's Liberation Day tariffs last year, a move that ultimately prompted Trump to walk back many of his tariff threats.\n\nA bigger sell-off in Treasurys could be prompted if the \"sell America\" gains more traction, Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday.\n\n\"The administration's goal is to have lower interest rates to aid US households and businesses, which is hard to achieve if bond vigilantes send rates on the long-end of the yield curve higher,\" Hardika Singh, an economic strategist at Fundstrat Research, wrote in a client note.",

    "description": "Business leaders and CEOs weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders such as Ken Griffin and Matthew Prince have already weighed in on President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that he will not use force to get Greenland, but is \"seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition\" by the US.\n\nTrump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been dominating this year's Davos agenda.\n\nAll eyes were on Trump during his 70-minute-long speech, with billionaire CEOs — including Apple's Tim Cook and Salesforce's Marc Benioff — alongside heads of state filling up Congress Hall to hear what he had to say.\n\nHere is how some of the world's biggest business leaders have reacted:\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Squawk Box on Wednesday, Citadel's CEO and founder Ken Griffin said Trump had an \"important message to deliver to a European audience that, bluntly, needs to do better. Europe's economic growth lags far behind America.\"\n\n\"The commitment of the American people to defend our country runs deep. The commitment of the Europeans to defend their countries — if you look at surveys of the population — is not nearly as strong,\" he added.\n\nGriffin said he thought one of Trump's \"important foundational statements he made with respect to the justification why the US needs unfettered access to Greenland\" was whether Europe would be there for the US if there was another war.\n\nHowever, Griffin said that if the US does decide to \"pursue this path\", discussions \"should take time and be thoughtfully laid out.\"\n\n\"Investors around the world do not want to see an escalation of the stress in global trade that has played out over the last 12 months,\" the Citadel CEO added.\n\nPeter Schiff, the chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, said it looked like \"cooler heads prevailed at the White House.\"\n\n\"So if the US can't buy Greenland instead of taking it by military force, Trump will just hold a grudge,\" Schiff, whose firm managed $1.4 billion last year, wrote on X.\n\n\"While that is a major improvement, it also means that if we do succeed in buying Greenland, we'll massively overpay.\"\n\nSchiff also warned on X that a housing \"crash is coming.\"\n\n\"Trump basically admitted there is a housing bubble in the US. He also admitted his main policy goal is to prevent it from popping,\" Schiff wrote.\n\n\"But once you recognize a bubble, the worst thing you can do is try to sustain it. The sooner it bursts, the less damage it will ultimately cause.\"\n\nCloudflare's CEO appears to have commented on Trump's speech style.\n\n\"Last two times Trump spoke at Davos he stuck extremely close to the teleprompter. Not this time,\" Prince wrote on X.\n\nSpeaking on CNBC's Money Movers on Wednesday, the founder and executive chair of investment bank Moelis & Company, Ken Moelis, said he thought Trump \"made a very good case\" for a deal over Greenland.\n\n\"There was a real sigh of relief that he took military action off the table with Greenland. With President Trump, it's unusual for him to ever take an option off the table, so that was a big sigh of relief,\" he said.\n\nMoelis described Greenland as \"probably the biggest M&A deal in the history of the world\" and criticized Europe's approach to energy policy.\n\n\"You have to look at Europe and say their choices on energy policy have put them in the position they're in right now which is fairly weak economically and in a global position. And I thought he made a very good case for that,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump used his Davos address to press for US control of Greenland, defend tariffs, and frame global politics as a contest of power.",
    "fullText": "It was a speech that was never going to fly under the radar.\n\nPresident Donald Trump used his Davos address on Wednesday to press his case for US control of Greenland, criticize what he described as Europe's economic decline, and outline a series of domestic and global policy priorities — from tariffs and credit card rates to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe speech came after Trump's flight to Davos was delayed following a midair turnaround of Air Force One due to a \"minor electrical issue\" and a transatlantic flight on a backup jet.\n\nIt also came amid mounting backlash from European leaders, rattled markets, and warnings of retaliation that could hit America's biggest economic advantages.\n\nHere are the four biggest takeaways from Trump's remarks:\n\nTrump devoted a significant portion of his speech to Greenland, saying that the US does not plan to use military force and adding that no other country can secure the territory.\n\n\"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force, Trump said.\"\n\nAt the same time, he framed US control of Greenland as essential to global security and openly criticized America's allies.\n\n\"All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,\" Trump said.\n\n\"No nation or a group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States.\"\n\nTrump said US ownership would benefit NATO, even as he questioned the alliance's reliability.\n\n\"This would greatly enhance the security of the entire NATO alliance,\" he said, adding: \"We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.\"\n\nTrump repeatedly returned to tariffs as a central tool of leverage, describing them as a way to get other countries to change behavior.\n\n\"Instead of raising taxes on domestic producers, we're lowering them and raising tariffs on foreign nations,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that tariffs have enabled him to secure concessions that would not have been possible otherwise.\n\n\"Without tariffs, I wouldn't have been able to get it done,\" he said.\n\nAt one point, he described his negotiating style in blunt terms, telling the audience that when tariffs are on the table, the message to other countries is simple: \"You're going to do it fast.\"\n\nTrump used some of his most emotive language when discussing energy policy, particularly renewable power.\n\nHe dismissed green policies as \"the Green New Scam\" in reference to the EU's Green New Deal and called it \"perhaps the greatest hoax in history,\" adding that wind turbines ruin landscapes while losing money.\n\n\"Windmills all over the place destroy your land,\" Trump said.\"Stupid people buy them.\"\n\nHe also accused China of profiting from renewable energy by manufacturing windmills for export while relying on other energy sources at home, suggesting Beijing sells green technology it does not fully embrace itself.\n\nTrump said that parts of Europe have declined economically and politically — without naming specific cities or countries.\n\n\"Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable anymore,\" he said, adding that the changes were \"not in a positive way.\"\n\nHe blamed European governments for weakening themselves through energy and economic policy.\n\n\"They're destroying themselves,\" Trump said of European countries.\n\nAt the same time, he positioned the US as the central force in the global economy and security.\n\n\"The USA is the economic engine on the planet,\" he said. \"When America booms, the entire world booms.\"\n\n\"I'm working every day to ensure our military is very powerful. Our borders are very strong. And above all, our economy is strong because national security requires economic security and economic prosperity,\" he added.",

    "description": "Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel, weighed in on how Trump's economic and geopolitical policies have impacted the US during the World Economic Forum.",
    "fullText": "Hours before President Donald Trump's highly anticipated speech at the World Economic Forum, Ken Griffin, the outspoken billionaire CEO of Citadel, gave his rundown of the US leader's key economic policies.\n\nTrump's tariffs have been \"a negative\" and have left the US economy in a \"pretty unfortunate position,\" said Griffin at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's policy to raise tariffs on imports to the US has \"disrupted long-standing trading relationships\" and led to \"higher inflation,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"We've obviously increased the amount of cronyism in America as corporate CEOs have lined up in Washington trying to argue why their business should be exempted from tariffs, and many have prevailed,\" he added.\n\nCentral to Trump's tariff agenda is the promise that manufacturing will return to America, reducing US dependency on foreign nations for critical items.\n\n\"We have yet to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States,\" said Griffin.\n\nThe Citadel CEO highlighted that Trump is clearly following through on the platform he was elected on and said that tariffs have had some of their intended effects, though he did not specify what these were.\n\nBut one of the main problems with US tariffs is that business leaders are uncertain about how long the policy will stay in place.\n\n\"I think people have a very hard time believing that the current tariff regime's going to persist,\" said Griffin. \"Before you spend hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars to build a manufacturing plan, you really want to believe that the policy that is the anchor of that decision will be permanent in nature.\"\n\nGriffin also gave his two cents on Trump's immigration and geopolitical policies.\n\nNo country's borders should be open to mass immigration, but closing down the Southern border has meant losing a large supply of labor, said Griffin.\n\n\"These are people who did a lot of very, very difficult work, very modest wages, which helped to reduce the level of inflation in the United States,\" he said, adding that he expected housing and food prices to rise in the coming years as a result.\n\nThe bigger problem that Trump's immigration policy has caused for the US is that \"we're potentially losing access to the best and brightest minds from around the world,\" said Griffin.\n\n\"The majority of Silicon Valley is either run by immigrants or children of immigrants,\" he said, and their companies have created \"a tremendous number of jobs in the United States.\"\n\nSpeaking ahead of Trump's speech at Davos on Wednesday, Griffin said he was uncertain about what the US president was hoping to achieve by clashing with Europe over ownership of Greenland: \"What I can't understand is why are we fighting over a piece of rock covered by ice?\"\n\n\"We have frayed our relationship with our European allies in ways that I don't understand or appreciate, but there is a push here to get Europe to step up,\" said Griffin.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump ruled out using force to acquire Greenland, but said that he wants \"right, title, and ownership\" of the nation.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court heard arguments over Trump's efforts to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. The case has broad implications for the economy.",
    "fullText": "Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices expressed wariness with what Justice Samuel Alito described as a \"hurried\" attempt from the Trump administration to oust Lisa Cook from her position as a Federal Reserve board governor — and then to rush her case to the high court when lower courts allowed her to keep her post.\n\nSeveral members of the Republican-appointed majority also expressed sharp disagreement with the Trump administration's claim that judges lack the authority to review a president's power to fire members from the Federal Reserve board.\n\n\"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause, that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, told Solicitor General John Sauer.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision could have broad ramifications for Federal Reserve independence, a cornerstone of American monetary policy and the status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nThe hearing comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell revealed that the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into his handling of the Fed's office renovations. Powell has said the investigation is a \"pretext\" for an attempt to pressure the central bank for political reasons.\n\nPowell attended Wednesday's oral arguments, along with Cook and former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nMembers of the Federal Reserve's board of governors can only be removed for \"cause.\" Trump attempted to fire Cook in August, alleging she had lied on mortgage paperwork and therefore could not be trusted with her role in the Fed, which sets interest rates that influence mortgage lending rates.\n\nCook — an appointee of former President Joe Biden whose Federal Reserve board term ends in 2038 — argued that Trump's real intent was to replace her with an appointee who would more quickly drive down interest rates. Trump did not give Cook an opportunity to explain the apparent discrepancies in her mortgage paperwork before he posted the letter firing her on his Truth Social account.\n\nWednesday's oral argument didn't concern the merits of Trump's allegations about Cook's mortgage paperwork, but whether the judicial branch had the power to ensure Cook could keep her job while additional litigation plays out.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts — in a sentiment echoed by every other member of the Supreme Court except for Justice Clarence Thomas — expressed skepticism at the idea that the judicial branch couldn't have a role in checking the legitimacy of a \"for cause\" firing.\n\n\"If there is any level of cause — and you indicate that there is some level of cause, right? — well, then you can't be right about the idea that a court can't order anybody who's been removed to be reinstated,\" Roberts told Sauer.\n\nKavanaugh, while pressing Sauer, suggested that the Trump administration's position effectively erased the distinction between \"for cause\" and \"at-will\" firing — a notion that all of the Democratic appointees on the court also appeared to agree with.\n\nThe Trump administration's position may open the door for a Democratic president to fire all of Trump's Federal Reserve board appointees using \"trivial or inconsequential or old allegations,\" Kavanaugh said.\n\n\"It incentivizes kind of the 'search-and-destroy and find something, and just put that on a piece of paper — no judicial review, no process, nothing, you're done,'\" Kavanaugh said.\n\nAlito asked about why Cook had to be fired and the lawsuit against her handled in a \"cursory manner.\" He asked Sauer whether Cook's mortgage application had even been entered into evidence in the case.\n\nSauer said he wasn't sure if the paperwork itself had been seen by the district court judge who allowed Cook to keep her job, but that screenshots of the text of her mortgage application were included in social media posts.\n\n\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody — by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit — in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked. \"You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts.\"\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, expressed anxiety about whether removing Cook could risk a recession, as economists have warned.\n\nShe wondered whether a dispute over mortgage paperwork was severe enough grounds to fire Cook, and why Trump didn't make an effort to give her the opportunity to respond to his allegations.\n\n\"Sit down across the table in the Roosevelt room where the president provides Governor Cook with the evidence and waits to hear what her response is, gives her a chance to defend herself,\" Barrett said. \"I mean, that just wouldn't be that big a deal.\"\n\nAfter Sauer finished addressing the justices' questions, Cook's lawyer Paul Clement took the podium. He said Sauer's approach effectively erased the \"for cause\" standard required for firing members of the Fed.\n\n\"If there's no judicial review, then this is all kind of a joke,\" Clement said.\n\nThis is a developing story.

The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.\"\n\nShe was speaking before Trump said on Wednesday that he is seeking \"immediate negotiations\" to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, but that he \"won't use force\". His pursuit of the mineral-rich Arctic territory has caused growing tensions with European allies.\n\nDenmark could play in the World Cup - which will see 78 of the 104 matches staged in the US - if its team qualifies via play-offs.\n\nIn a statement, the chief executive of the Danish Football Association, Erik Brogger Rasmussen, told BBC Sport: \"We are, of course, aware of the current sensitive situation.\n\n\"Like many others, we are following it closely on an ongoing basis.

His shocking admission that the move is linked to a personal gripe over being snubbed for last year’s Nobel Peace Prize has further raised alarm both at home and abroad, with some fearing that at 79 years old, he may simply no longer be up to the job.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story. The president has previously described his cognitive and physical health as “perfect.”",

    "title": "Calls to invoke 25th Amendment grow as Trump tries to acquire Greenland. How does it work, and has it been used before?",
    "description": "The president's unusual text message to Norway's prime minister has prompted growing calls from lawmakers for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.",
    "fullText": "A growing number of lawmakers are calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked to remove President Trump from office after Trump told Norway’s prime minister that his position on purchasing Greenland is tied to not winning the Nobel Peace Prize and he no longer feels obligated to “think purely of Peace.”\n\nThe remarkable exchange happened on Jan. 18, when the Norwegian leader, Jonas Gahr Store, sent a text message to Trump on behalf of himself and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb. The European leaders sent the message in an attempt to “deescalate” the increased conflict over Greenland and the latest tariff threat against the U.S.’s European allies.\n\nIn less than half an hour, Trump responded, writing, “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government, but rather the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The five members of the committee are appointed by the country’s parliament.\n\nTrump doubled down on his intentions to “purchase” Greenland, writing, “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you!” and signing it “President DJT.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts is one of several members of Congress to call for Trump’s removal from office using the 25th Amendment. “Invoke the 25th Amendment,” Markey posted on X, along with a picture of a news headline of Trump’s unusual text message with Store. Additional Democratic House members, such as Reps. Eric Swalwell, Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Yassamin Ansari, have also called for the removal of Trump by invoking the 25th Amendment.\n\nIt dates back to 1963, when Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. There was no plan in place to choose Johnson’s replacement, and there was concern about the procedure if he were to become ill or incapacitated before a new vice president could be named. In 1965, Congress formally proposed the 25th Amendment, and it became part of the Constitution in February 1967.\n\nThe 25th Amendment has four sections. The first three clarify the presidential order of succession and who can temporarily assume the president’s duties. Section 4 gets the most attention: It’s a multi-step process for the vice president and the Cabinet to declare that the president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nInvoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment would require Vice President JD Vance and the majority of Trump’s Cabinet to submit a declaration to Congress that Trump isn’t able to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Doing so would mean an immediate transfer of presidential power to Vance, who would serve as acting president. Trump would have the chance to refute the declaration, which could then be challenged by his Cabinet. Congress would have 21 days from the date of receiving the declaration to formally approve any decision to remove Trump from office.\n\nA two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed in order for Trump to be removed from office. Otherwise, he would regain his presidential powers.\n\nThe first section of the 25th Amendment was invoked when Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in 1974 and was replaced by his vice president, Gerald Ford. Section 2 was used when Gerald Ford, as president, nominated Nelson Rockefeller for vice president, and he was confirmed in the House and the Senate.\n\nSection 3 was used in 1985 when Ronald Reagan underwent brief cancer surgery and Vice President George H.W. Bush assumed his responsibilities. In 2002 and 2007, George W. Bush invoked Section 3 when he underwent medical procedures, and then-Vice President Dick Cheney became acting president.\n\nSection 4 has never been used because the process is so challenging. It’s more difficult to remove a president under the 25th Amendment using Section 4 than under the impeachment process.\n\nThe purpose of seeking impeachment to remove a president from office is to address potential “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”\n\nThe House would require a simple majority to vote on Articles of Impeachment, which are formal written charges against a president. After a trial, the Senate would vote on whether to convict and remove the president from office, which requires a two-thirds vote. The Senate can vote in a separate proceeding to ban the president from holding future office, which would require a simple majority vote.\n\nTrump was impeached twice during his first term in office. The first time was on Dec. 18, 2019, for initiating foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election, and the second was on Jan. 13, 2021, following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In each case, he was acquitted on all counts by the Senate and remained in office.\n\nShould the movement grow to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump due to incapacity or inability to perform presidential duties, invoking it would require a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate. The president would not be barred from holding future office.",

    "description": "The European Union could roll out a never-before-used tool known as a trade \"bazooka\" should Trump move forward with his proposed tariffs.",
    "fullText": "Europe is weighing retaliation if President Donald Trump imposes more tariffs — and it threatens the US's big global advantage.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pushed to activate what's commonly referred to as a trade \"bazooka\" in response to Trump's recent threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on European countries unless they agree to a deal ceding control of Greenland.\n\n\"The anti-coercion mechanism is a powerful instrument, and we should not hesitate to deploy it in today's tough environment,\" Macron said at the World Economic Forum at Davos on Tuesday.\n\nMacron was referring to a tool passed by the EU in 2023 that would allow it to impose tariffs on imports and restrict services from the US.\n\nThe hit to services such as pharma, tech, and finance would be the new blow to the US economy, as tariffs tend to focus on goods. While the US has a trade deficit for goods, it has a surplus for services.\n\nThe US exported $1.1 trillion in services in 2024, according to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, and has exported more services than it has imported for the last five decades, making it the world's leading services exporter. The St. Louis Fed said in its report that it means \"the U.S. can specialize in services and trade with other countries, which leads to greater efficiency and more benefits for consumers.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis also found that the US exported $489 billion in services to Europe that same year.\n\nAlex Durante, a senior economist at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, told Business Insider that these threats are \"uncharted territory,\" and Trump's push to acquire Greenland could put the US' international standing at risk.\n\n\"America really would lose whatever standing it still has in the world if it were to go forward and do something like that,\" Durante said.\n\nWhite House Spokesman Kush Desai told Business Insider that \"the Trump administration has kept its word\" on its trade deal with the EU earlier this year, adding, \"the EU's time would be better spent delivering on these trade commitments.\"\n\nIn his plan, Trump called out eight European countries that opposed US control of Greenland and sent troops to the country, including Denmark, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom, as potential targets for more tariffs.\n\nThose tariffs would be raised to 25% in June if those countries do not agree to the deal, Trump said.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nA Q&A from the EU Commission said that the anti-coercion tool is \"designed to be broad\" to allow for an \"efficient response to an individual case of economic coercion with minimal or no impact on the EU economy.\"\n\nIt could restrict access to European markets for US-based service exporters, such as Big Tech companies and Wall Street firms.\n\nThe trigger for this tool, per the Commission, would be a situation in which a country pressures a member of the EU into making a decision through trade threats.\n\nDurante highlighted the intellectual property issues; the EU could restrict certain IP licenses for US firms. It could similarly limit US banks' access to EU markets, increasing costs domestically.\n\n\"A lot of those sectors, in terms of the tariffs that Trump has imposed, have been insulated from that because of the exemptions,\" Durante said.\n\nIf Trump follows through on his threatened tariffs on EU countries, prices of affected goods would likely increase. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy — a German think tank — found in a recent report that examined over 25 million shipment records that 96% of US tariffs have been paid by US consumers between January 2024 and November 2025.\n\nAnd if the EU rolls out the bazooka, it would take time — the Commission said it would have four months to examine the allegations and up to six months to determine an appropriate response. At the same time, the Trump administration is awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling on the legality of many of the president's tariffs, which could limit the tools that Trump has for future trade threats.\n\nAmerican workers could also be affected, Durante said, because the anti-coercion tool would target \"natively American firms\" and reduce their market access and profitability.\n\n\"When you have this kind of tit for tat policy, the US threatens something, the EU responds, and then we threaten something else even beyond that, it could really get out of hand very fast and make citizens of both the EU and the US worse off,\" Durante said.",

    "description": "Aviaja Fontain is worried that generational trauma will continue in Greenland if the US acquires the territory, which is under the Kingdom of Denmark.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aviaja Fontain, a 40-year-old mother born and raised in Greenland's capital, Nuuk. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Greenland, a territory under the Kingdom of Denmark with a population of around 56,000. Trump said he will impose new tariffs on several European countries, including Denmark, until a deal is reached. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI kept on looking toward the harbor to see if the US Navy was here after Trump raided Venezuela.\n\nThe first few days after the raid, of course, it was scary. I felt like we were all just waiting to get invaded. I kept on looking at the airplanes to see if they were American soldiers.\n\nI'm seeing more Danish officers coming to Greenland now, and they're training in the Arctic or near Nuuk. It feels weird. We're not used to it.\n\nI keep telling myself Trump doesn't have any legal right to annex Greenland because I don't want to be scared. I was going to orchestrate a demonstration in protest, but I'm in school and my exams were taking too much time.\n\nI know Trump says he will treat us with respect, but I don't believe him. He needs to leave Greenland and Greenlanders alone.\n\nMany of us Greenlanders love nature very much, so it's important to us that we can walk in the mountains, where it's so peaceful and quiet. I fear that Trump will try to take over Greenland, search for rare minerals and oil, and all of that will disappear.\n\nWe just want our land to be peaceful. No one is fighting for security, minerals, or anything. We are people. We have rights. We have a culture. You can't just take that and buy it.\n\nThere is generational trauma from when we were first colonized by Denmark. If we're going to be colonized by the US, then there's going to be more generational trauma. What is going to happen with our kids in the future?\n\nMy son said that if something were to happen, he would fight for his country and his fellow Greenlanders. He is 19.\n\nIf it really happens, if the US annexes Greenland, maybe I will have to flee the capital, but I told my mom, \"I don't think I will ever leave Nuuk because we have lived here most of our lives.\"\n\nI think all of us want independence from Denmark, but when we are ready. Maybe in my lifetime. You never know what will happen in the future.\n\nIn response, the White House's Deputy Press Secretary, Anna Kelly, told Business Insider in an email that President Trump's ideas are about bolstering US national security.\n\n\"Many of this President's predecessors recognized the strategic logic of acquiring Greenland, but only President Trump has had the courage to pursue this seriously. As the President said, NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the United States, and Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,\" Kelly wrote.",

    "title": "Who is Lisa Cook? Meet the Federal Reserve governor whose future is in the hands of the Supreme Court",
    "description": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook was at the center of Donald Trump's pressure campaign until Jerome Powell said he was under investigation.",
    "fullText": "Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook's future was already set before the Supreme Court. Then the Justice Department sent subpoenas to the central bank.\n\nWith a criminal investigation hanging over the Fed, Wednesday's oral arguments are shaping up to be a prelude to a potential historic ruling.\n\nThe White House has said it had no role in the subpoenas. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who is expected to be in attendance, has portrayed the investigation as part of a retribution campaign — an argument Cook herself made when Trump tried to fire her in August 2025.\n\nHere's how Cook found herself at the center of a legal showdown with Trump.\n\nLisa DeNell Cook was born in 1964 in Milledgeville, Georgia. Her father, Payton B. Cook, was a chaplain at Central State Hospital. Mary Murray Cook, her mother, was a nurse and the first African-American tenured faculty member at Georgia College and State University.\n\nCook and her sisters were among the first Black students to integrate into local schools. She has said she has scars from when students beat her.\n\n\"I still have scars from that — scar where hair won't grow in my eyebrow and a scar on my leg from having been beaten during that period, during the period of desegregation,\" Cook told NPR in 2020.\n\nThe Civil Rights movement runs throughout Cook's family. Cook's cousin, Floyd McKissick Sr., helped organize the March on Washington.\n\nHer uncle, Samuel DuBois Cook, was a classmate of Martin Luther King Jr. at Morehouse College. In 1966, DuBois Cook became the first Black professor to hold a regular appointment at a white Southern university when he accepted a position at Duke, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford.\n\n\"He instilled in me the deep belief of the Civil Rights Movement that with faith, preparation, and great effort, things could and would be better,\" Cook said, praising her uncle and a host of relatives in April 2024 when she accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Duke University center that bears her uncle's name.\n\nIn 1986, Cook graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and physics from Spelman College, a historically Black, all-women's university. While at Spelman, Cook became the first Spelman student to win the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.\n\nTwo years later, Cook added a BA in philosophy, politics, and economics from the University of Oxford. Cook also studied at the Université Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Senegal. In 2020, she told Finance & Development, the International Monetary Fund's magazine, that a chance encounter while studying in Senegal pushed her into the field of economics.\n\nShe later earned her Ph.D. in economics from the University of California, Berkeley. Her dissertation was on \"External and Internal Credit Markets in Tsarist and Post-Soviet Russia.\"\n\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden nominated Cook to the Federal Reserve. At the time, Democrats narrowly controlled the US Senate. While Federal Reserve nominees are often confirmed with broad, bipartisan support, Cook's nomination faced significant opposition.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who at the time was the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said she was \"grossly unqualified\" to serve on the central bank due to her lack of monetary policy experience.\n\n\"Professor Cook's record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the Fed's work — at a time when we need the Fed focused on fighting inflation,\" Toomey said.\n\nThen-Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, who led the Senate Banking Committee, said that Cook was \"extremely qualified.\"\n\n\"A small but loud minority have wrongly claimed that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the standards for this position — standards that only seem to apply for certain nominees,\" Brown said in 2022. \"Still, she has met and exceeded all of those high bars: she's a Ph.D. economist, she is a tenured professor, and she is sought by organizations around the world for her input and perspective.\"\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Vice President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm Cook. Soon after, Cook became the first Black woman to serve on the Federal Reserve Board in its over 100-year history. She continues to hold this distinction.\n\nIn May 2023, Biden renominated Cook for a full term that lasts until 2038. She was reconfirmed by a 51-47 vote.\n\nIn August 2025, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Justice Department. In a letter to the DOJ, Pulte said he took allegations of mortgage fraud \"very seriously.\" An outspoken critic of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Pulte has repeatedly said that his investigation into Cook is not connected to his criticism of the central bank.\n\nOn August 20, Trump called on Cook to resign. Five days later, Trump publicly posted a letter to Cook saying that he was firing her — the first time in history a president had tried to fire a member of the central bank.\n\nPulte said that Cook indicated that two separate properties she purchased around the same time were both her primary residence. In his letter, Trump cited the allegations as sufficient reason to fire Cook for cause. In a legal filing, Cook's attorneys explicitly denied that she ever committed mortgage fraud.\n\n\"Setting aside the fact that Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud, any such pre-office offense plainly would not have been 'so infamous a nature, as to render the offender unfit to execute any public franchise,'\" the attorneys wrote in a filing earlier this month.\n\nCook's lawyers have also said that the president did not give her sufficient time to respond to Pulte's allegations before her attempted firing.\n\nOn September 9, US District Judge Jia Cobb moved to grant Cook's request to temporarily block Trump's firing.\n\n\"The best reading of the 'for cause' provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the Board of Governors are limited to grounds concerning a Governor's behavior in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties,\" Cobb wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed the ruling, seeking to immediately remove Cook as the case continues to unfold. The Supreme Court ruled in October that Cook can remain on the job, pending oral arguments.\n\n\"The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order,\" Cook's lawyers Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen said in a statement.\n\nTrump still could win the final battle after justices hear the case next year, a position the White House holds.\n\n\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"\n\nThe Fed initially tried to stay out of the dispute. A lawyer for the central bank wrote in a court filing in August that it simply wanted a quick resolution.\n\n\"At this time, the Board merely expresses (1) its interest in a prompt ruling by this Court to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty; and (2) its intent to follow any order this Court issues,\" Joshua P. Chadwick, assistant general counsel for the Fed, said in a court filing.\n\nCook continued to participate in Fed meetings before her case reached the justices, including casting votes on interest rate cuts. Cook's lawyers pointed out that she will likely participate in at least one more Federal Open Market Committee before the Supreme Court issues its ruling.\n\n\"That the status quo has been maintained for months without any apparent problem only confirms that the public interest favors allowing Governor Cook to retain her office while this suit proceeds,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in a November filing.",

    "title": "Trump's workplace harassment fighters are taking on a big new target",
    "description": "The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission has a new focus: White men.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Andrea Lucas, the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, posted a video to X asking an unusual question: \"Are you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex?\" she says to the camera. \"The EEOC is committed to identifying, attacking, and eliminating all forms of race and sex discrimination — including against white male applicants and employees.\"\n\nThe video has been viewed nearly 6 million times, with top comments heaping praise. \"This message gave me hope because I did not think this was ever possible to happen to me in America,\" one user wrote. The video wasn't announcing a new policy; white men have been protected from discrimination just as people of any race or gender under the law. But it capped a year of sweeping efforts to align the bipartisan, independent EEOC with President Donald Trump's culture war on \"woke.\"\n\nThe yearlong campaign began when the president quickly ousted two of the three Democrats on the EEOC last January, leaving it without a quorum for months. The commission also paused processing charges related to gender identity and sexuality for nearly five months; it resumed them with a focus on hiring, firing, and promotions and under heightened scrutiny. Following an executive order from Trump, the EEOC ceased investigating what are known as disparate impact cases, which take on policies that appear neutral on the surface yet can still be discriminatory if they unfairly limit certain groups (a height requirement for a job, say). And in late December, the EEOC filed a request to rescind guidance on harassment that it had published in 2024, which it will vote on this Thursday. EEO Leaders, a group that includes former EEOC officials, said the request is part of the Trump administration's efforts to attack anti-discrimination laws and create confusion around federal laws that bar gender- and sexuality-based harassment. \"It is yet another salvo in this administration's prolonged attack on LGBTQI+ people,\" the group said in a public statement.\n\nNow, Trump's campaign promise to fight an \"anti-white feeling\" in America has materialized at the EEOC. Lucas, who was installed formally as chair in November, told Reuters last month it is her goal to \"shift to a conservative view of civil rights,\" which includes inquiries into DEI programs that the administration argues can discriminate against white men and religious liberty issues. Deborah Vagins, national campaign director of Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender equity in workplaces and schools, says it's an effort underway to \"remake the EEOC in Trump's image.\"\n\nLegal experts I spoke to for this story noted that white men can be subjected to race- or gender-based discrimination, while racial minorities and women are more likely to report discrimination at work. A University of Massachusetts, Amherst analysis of EEOC charges between 2012 and 2016 found that about five in 100,000 male workers filed charges for sex discrimination, and 1 in 100,000 white workers filed charges for racial discrimination. For Black people, that figure jumps to 195 for every 100,000 workers. An analysis of EEOC data from the National Women's Law Center found that during fiscal year 2016, nearly 7,000 sexual harassment charges were filed, 82% from women. \"There is no evidence that there is such overwhelming discrimination against white men that the very, very limited resources of the EEOC should be directed in that direction,\" Vagins says.\n\nCcreated in 1965, the EEOC investigates claims of workplace discrimination and is the primary enforcer of workplace protections codified by the Civil Rights Act. In 2024, the commission won some $700 million for workers through settlements and litigation, often for minority workers who have faced disproportionate discrimination.\n\nAfter the racial and gender reckonings of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, many companies went all-in on public statements cheering diversity and launched DEI programs. Claims that men had become the victims left out of inclusion programs followed. Half of men ages 18 to 29 believe there is \"some\" or \"a lot\" of discrimination against men in the US, according to the Survey Center on American Life, up from about a third in 2019. Trump told The New York Times this month that he believes \"white people were very badly treated\" following the passage of the Civil Rights Act 60 years ago. He added: \"It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people — people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job. So it was, it was a reverse discrimination.\"\n\nWhite men hold an overwhelming majority of CEO roles at Fortune 500 companies. Last year, the gender pay gap widened for a second year in a row. Workplace discrimination and harassment is underreported, but experts tell me that it's difficult to say white men in particular are missing at high rates from the data. A survey of federal workers found that about a third of white men said they have experienced harassment, like bullying or physical intimidation, at work; those who had were more likely than other white men to see systemic race and gender bias at work, and to take action in reporting incidents of bias against their colleagues, according to a University of Michigan study in 2023. There's been little time to see the long-term effects of post-2020 DEI efforts. A Wall Street Journal analysis of 13 million jobs found that the largest public companies' workforces became slightly less white, with Asian and Hispanic workers gaining ground, while half of all senior management roles still belonged to white men. A 2025 Stanford University study that examined how companies hired after facing a DEI-related controversy found that large firms made small changes, increasing the hiring of women and people of color at about 0.8% — mostly into junior positions.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last year that plaintiffs of a majority class, like white or straight people, do not have to meet a higher standard of proof than minorities to win discrimination cases, and the EEOC callout to white men could bring in more cases that were previously unreported. Legal experts I spoke to characterized the video as \"clumsy,\" \"inappropriate,\" and unprecedented, since the EEOC hasn't historically solicited complaints from specific protected classes over others. (The EEOC did not respond to questions I sent for this story). The shift in messaging doesn't mean that other groups are less entitled to fighting workplace discrimination. \"It is a lot of shock and awe, smoke and mirrors, distraction,\" says Nance Schick, an employment attorney and workplace mediator. \"But the law hasn't changed.\"\n\nAs the EEOC looks to take on issues affecting white men, corporate mentor programs that focus on women or people of color could become targets, if they exclude white men from similar mentorship opportunities, legal experts say. In the video, Lucas directs viewers to an EEOC webpage focused on discrimination related to DEI, which it says is \"a broad term that is not defined in the statute.\" She adds that such programs could be illegal if they take any employment action motivated by a worker's gender, sex, or other protected characteristics. The specter of legal action could lead more companies to abandon DEI efforts. With the mounting attacks on DEI, companies must carefully review and audit their DEI programs, which is costly in time and resources, Nonnie Shivers, co-chair of the DEI compliance practice group for law firm Ogletree Deakins.\n\nIn March, the EEOC sent letters to 20 law firms seeking details about their DEI policies. Companies like Target and Amazon immediately scrapped all or parts of their DEI programs as Trump took office. The sudden shifts with the EEOC aren't changes to discrimination law, experts told me. \"Employers should not reflexively comply with unreasonable demands that are not supported by the law,\" says Jenny Yang, a former EEOC commissioner. Companies should \"do their own analysis of the law and the risks,\" she says. \"If they reflexively pull back on important equal opportunity efforts, their workforce will suffer and they could start seeing discrimination complaints from many different groups.\"\n\nThe dropping of disparate impact cases could also shift the type of investigations conducted by the EEOC. These complaints can take the form of barring people with criminal history from jobs unrelated to their convictions, or seemingly standardized tests that may not be so standard across races. They focus on ways that systemic requirements can disproportionately help or hurt groups. They're also vital for evaluating how AI is used in hiring, Yang says, which have been shown to repeat human biases in selecting some resumes over others, like knocking applicants who may have interrupted work histories (resume gaps tend to be more common among women who leave the workforce to care for children). \"The tension here is that it is often difficult to prove intentional discrimination,\" Yang says. \"Discrimination can manifest in much more subtle and complex ways, which disparate impact is important to demonstrate.\"\n\nFor workers subjected to discrimination — all of them, not just white men — there are still protections. \"It remains incredibly critical for employers to update their training modules to be maximally inclusive with examples, quizzes, questions, and other materials to understand the broad nature of the law protecting everyone.\" says Shivers. Whether the EEOC's campaign will uncover wide-ranging discrimination against white men remains to be seen. But Lucas's video leaves no doubt about the direction the EEOC is heading in this year.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "description": "President Trump called the UK's decision to give away the Chagos Islands \"an act of great stupidity\" and a reason for the US to acquire Greenland.",
    "fullText": "That is what President Donald Trump called the UK's decision to give away a group of islands where a strategic military base is located.\n\nThe Diego Garcia military base is a cornerstone of US and allied power projection across the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. As the UK moves to transfer sovereignty of the islands, its strategic importance has turned the base into a political and diplomatic flash point.\n\nThe island's strategic location has long made it especially valuable for US military operations, including long-range bomber missions and naval deployments — a role underscored by satellite images last year showing US bombers operating from the base.\n\nLocated in the Chagos Islands, Diego Garcia became the site of a US-UK military installation after Britain forcibly removed the native Chagossian people in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seven years ago, in 2019, the International Court of Justice ruled that the removals were unlawful and said that the UK should relinquish control of the islands.\n\nThe UK has since reached a deal to transfer the sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, near Madagascar, while allowing Diego Garcia to remain under British control on a 99-year lease, with an option to renew. The arrangement is expected to cost the UK about $136 million a year.\n\nThe UK government's decision was previously praised by the Trump administration as a \"monumental achievement\" that secured \"the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"\n\nTrump's assessment appears to have shifted.\n\n\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday.\n\nHe said there was \"no doubt\" that Russia and China had \"noticed this act of total weakness,\" arguing that the UK \"giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY.\"\n\nHe stressed that the move \"is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\" Trump has been increasingly focused on taking control of Greenland lately. He has argued its needed for Golden Dome, among other reasons.\n\nThe British prime minister's office told the BBC that \"the president explicitly recognised its strength last year,\" adding that the Five Eyes intelligence agencies also approved of the transfer.\n\nTrump said at the White House later on Tuesday that the deal had changed from its original format. \"I think they should keep it,\" he said.\n\nDiego Garcia has been a secretive military installation for the US and UK since the early 1970s. It's extremely remote, far from nearby landmasses, and strategically placed so that the US and UK have air power and maritime reach from the Indian Ocean toward the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Africa.\n\nThe base hosts units from the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force, as well as the UK Royal Navy. Due to its geographical location, Diego Garcia is also critical for refueling operations for military aircraft and vessels. American bombers, such as B-1 Lancers, B-2 Spirits, and B-52 Stratofortresses, have been seen at the base, as well as nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nFrom Diego Garcia, US bombers launched attacks in Afghanistan after 9/11 and against Iraq during the 2003 invasion. And in 1991, the installation was central to US attacks during the first Gulf War. The base was crucial to the logistics operations supporting Middle Eastern missions, keeping aircraft nearby and operational.\n\nThe B-2 bomber holding the record for the longest bombing run in history landed at Diego Garcia after flying over 44 hours from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri in 2001.\n\nIn June 2025, prior to US attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, or Operation Midnight Hammer, experts speculated that a significant B-2 bomber presence spotted at Diego Garcia could be involved in some sort of strike on Iran. Imagery at the time showed a notable force posture there. The actual strike, however, involved a B-2 bomber task force that flew out of the US.",

His methods are causing great tension among his allies, but they agree that the Arctic is an area of risk.\n\n\"I think President Trump is right. Other leaders in NATO are right.

The first: Can the West grow economies fast enough to overcome deficits?\n\n\"That can be one big issue, especially with the rising deficits of the US,\" Fink said.\n\nSecondly, another limiting factor is whether Western economies can make a J-curve of demand happen for AI and other technologies.\n\n\"The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations,\" Fink said. \"If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail.\"\n\nTax us — that's the message from nearly 400 wealthy people, who've signed an open letter addressed to the leaders gathering at Davos.\n\nThe letter's co-signees called out a \"handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth,\" accusing them of harming society as a whole across governance, tech, innovation, and the environment.\n\nThe solution, per the letter, comes down to one thing — taxing the superrich.\n\nSignatories include the actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno.\n\n\"I believe President Trump is going to be about 3 hours late,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a morning presser. \"I haven't seen the updated schedule.\"\n\nICYMI: Trump had to switch planes after an electrical fault was detected on board Air Force One.\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nDavid Steinbach, Hines' global chief investment officer, didn't mince words when describing the overall real-estate environment.\n\n\"It's been a really bad few years, honestly,\" Steinbach told me. \"Really beginning in 2022.\"\n\nRising geopolitical tensions and the siloing of regions can make the environment even trickier. Especially for a company with over $90 billion of assets across 30 countries. Still, Steinbach told me that Hines raised about 50% more discretionary capital year over year in 2025.\n\n\"There's a risk and opportunity, right? The risk is it's now different. And that's probably not changing anytime soon,\" Steinbach said. \"The opportunity is a lot needs to be built now, because you've got supply chains that need to get re-looked. You got very directive investments in-country.\"\n\n\"That's creating a lot of demand as well,\" Steinbach added.\n\nOn the schedule for Wednesday: Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.\n\nTrump ran into some travel trouble en route to Davos late Tuesday. He was forced to switch from Air Force One to a backup plane after an electrical fault was detected on board. Flight maps show Air Force One making a U-turn over the waters off Long Island, then landing back in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe president is now back on the road and on his way to Switzerland.",

García Harfuch said the government has sent 92 people in total.\n\nVideo shared by Mexican authorities shows a line of handcuffed prisoners surrounded by heavily armed and masked officers being loaded onto a military jet at an airport on the outskirts of Mexico City.\n\n“As the pressure increases, as demands from the White House dial up, (Mexico’s government) needs to resort to extraordinary measures, such as these transfers,” said David Mora, a Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s transfer included a handful of important figures from the Sinaloa Cartel, the Beltrán-Leyva cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Northeast Cartel, a remnant of the infamous Zetas based in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, across from Texas. Mexican authorities said that all had pending U.S. cases.\n\nAmong those transferred was María Del Rosario Navarro Sánchez, the first Mexican citizen to face charges in the U.S. for providing support to a terrorist organization, after being accused of conspiring with a cartel.\n\nTrump has publicly entertained the idea of military action on Mexican cartels, language that has only gotten more combative since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela deposed former President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month.\n\nTurning his attention to Mexico shortly after the Venezuela attack, Trump said in an interview with Fox News: “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels.”\n\nLast week, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke with Trump, telling him that U.S. intervention in Mexico was “not necessary,” but emphasizing that the two governments would continue to collaborate.\n\nLast February, Mexico sent 29 cartel figures to the U.S., including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985. In August, a second round saw 26 Mexican cartel figures sent to the U.S. None had the profile of Caro Quintero, but spanning multiple cartels, the figures could help U.S. prosecutors build cases.\n\nAfter the August transfer, García Harfuch said it was a public safety decision, because Mexico did not want them to continue operating their illicit businesses from inside Mexican prisons.\n\nAnother transfer of prisoners to the U.S. had been rumored for weeks. Mexico has sought to assure the Trump administration that it continues to be a willing partner in combating drug traffickers.\n\n\"For the Trump administration and the Trump base, what is going to matter in the end is some wins that Trump can actually bring back and say ‘Look this is what I’m getting out of Mexico,’” said Mora.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump threatened to blow the nation of Iran up if the country’s government did not stop taunting and threatening him amid growing unrest.\n\nIn a clip of his Tuesday evening interview on NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich Tonight released ahead of time, Trump was asked what his response was to what Pavlich described as taunts and threats issued by Iranian leadership aimed at the president.\n\n“Well, they shouldn’t be doing it, but I’ve left notification that if anything ever happens, the whole country’s going to get blown up,” Trump responded.\n\nTaking a moment to criticize his predecessor, President Joe Biden, for not saying anything about the Iranian regime, he then said, “A president has to defend a president. If I were here, and they were making that threat to somebody—not even a president, but somebody, like they did with me—I would absolutely hit them so hard.”\n\n“But I have very firm instructions,“ he continued. “Anything happens, they’re gonna wipe ’em off the face of this Earth.”\n\nTalking about his other geopolitical ambitions, including seizing control of Greenland, Trump argued that controlling the autonomous Danish territory is crucial in order to ensure the effectiveness of his so-called \"Golden Dome\" defense shield, telling Pavlich, “Having Greenland makes it a much more effective golden dome.”\n\n“So you’re saying Greenland is essential for the security of the United States and the free Western world?” Pavlich asked him. “That’s correct,” Trump replied, adding, “And even beyond missile defense, it is so important for the golden dome, it’s so important for just national, and actually international security.”\n\nThe president also made reference to top-secret weapons in his possession, telling Pavlich, “We have weapons that nobody knows about. It’s probably good not to talk about it, but we have some amazing weapons,” in reference to his attack on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nTrump has previously said that if Iran were to follow through on its threats to target U.S. military or commercial bases, “we will hit them at levels that they’ve never been hit before” with a “very, very powerful force.”\n\nWhen asked by a CNN reporter earlier this month if he thought the country took his threats seriously, Trump dismissed the question as stupid, arguing that Iran has “been through it for years with me” and citing the killings of Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Qasem Soleimani and ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as proof.\n\n“I think so. Don’t you think so, CNN? Don’t you think so? Wouldn’t you say that they probably do at this point? After going through it for years with me, being hit—Soleimani, al-Baghdadi—the Iran nuclear threat wiped out. Don’t you think?” he said, referring to the strikes he launched on three nuclear sites in Iran last June.\n\nThe president has expressed support for anti-government protesters in Iran, going so far as to encourage them to take over national institutions and assuring them that help is on the way as concerns mount about crackdowns on protesters, including arrests and unlawful killings.\n\n“Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!! Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY,” he wrote in a Jan. 13 Truth Social post.\n\nHe ended the post with “MIGA!!!,” or “Make Iran Great Again.”\n\nOne day later, he told reporters that he had been notified that Iran had stopped killing protestors and that there were no plans for further executions, providing no source for his claims.\n\nThe Iranian government responded to Trump’s threats with threats of their own, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying, “We are not looking for war, but we are prepared for war.” He added, “We are also ready for negotiations, but negotiations that are fair, with equal rights and mutual respect.”\n\nThe country’s Guardian Council also condemned the “insult and baseless rhetoric of the criminal and foolish” of Trump, and stressed that any transgression against Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei “is considered crossing the red line of the devout people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and will entail heavy costs and serious consequences.”",

The plane is set to be replaced in 2028 by two newer, modified 747-8s estimated to cost over $5 billion in total.\n\nAmid frustrations over delays to the new aircraft, Trump has courted the idea of using another 747-8, gifted to him by the Qatari government, as Air Force One instead.\n\nThe president has said that he plans to keep the $400 million luxury aircraft, which the Defense Department accepted as a gift in May 2025.\n\nThe press pool report sent on Tuesday evening said that Leavitt had joked to reporters that the Qatari jet sounded \"much better\" after the recent technical issue. The report added that the lights in the press cabin went out briefly after takeoff, but that the reason was unclear.\n\nTrump's threats to take over Greenland have been a huge talking point at Davos. He has repeatedly said he wants to buy the semi-autonomous territory, which is governed by Denmark, and is not opposed to using military force to take it.\n\nBefore taking off on Tuesday, the president said in a press briefing that he has a \"lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland\" at Davos.\n\n\"I think things are going to work out pretty well,\" he said to reporters.\n\nHe also said on Saturday that he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, if the European countries do not strike a deal with the US to hand over Greenland.",

    "description": "The order comes with a carveout: build-to-rent properties that were designed to be rental communities will not be affected.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday seeking to limit large Wall Street investors from buying single-family homes, as part of his push to make essentials more affordable for Americans.\n\nThe order details a multi-pronged plan targeting large investors. It includes measures that would restrict institutional investors from buying homes that individuals could purchase, combat speculation in the single-family housing market, and conduct antitrust reviews of acquisitions.\n\nThe order comes with an important exception: build-to-rent properties that were designed and constructed as rental communities. The order also says there may be other \"narrowly tailored exceptions.\"\n\nPer the order, the Treasury Department has a month to develop definitions of \"large institutional investors\" and \"single-family homes.\" Relevant federal agencies have 60 days to look at ways to prohibit the buying of single-family homes by large entities.\n\n\"Neighborhoods and communities once controlled by middle-class American families are now run by faraway corporate interests. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in the order.\n\nTrump first proposed the order in a Truth Social post earlier this month. \"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nA day later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Trump's proposal would not force large entities to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nAfter Trump's Truth Social post earlier this month, shares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6%. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nAmong Trump's efforts to address affordability concerns, the president also called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Banks and business leaders said that the rule would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.",

    "description": "A new report warns the U.S. could lose the ability to sustain combat within weeks of a China war over Taiwan, as munitions run dry, logistics collapse and global markets face a $10T shock.",
    "fullText": "FIRST ON FOX: The Trump administration asked for redactions to a sweeping new Heritage Foundation report modeling a potential U.S.–China war over Taiwan, even though the analysis relied entirely on publicly available, unclassified data, according to the report’s authors.\n\nThe redacted report, TIDALWAVE, warns that the United States could reach a breaking point within weeks of a high‑intensity conflict with China — conclusions that the authors say prompted senior national security officials to seek redactions over concerns adversaries could exploit the findings or use them to identify U.S. and allied military vulnerabilities.\n\nThose conclusions include warnings that U.S. forces would culminate far sooner than China, suffer catastrophic losses to aircraft and sustainment infrastructure in the Pacific, and still fail to prevent a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, nearly a tenth of global GDP.\n\nSKIES AT STAKE: INSIDE THE US-CHINA RACE FOR AIR DOMINANCE\n\nAccording to the report's authors, the AI‑enabled model drew exclusively on open‑source government, academic, industry and commercial information. An unredacted version of the report was provided to authorized U.S. government recipients for internal use.\n\nUnlike traditional tabletop war games, TIDALWAVE employs an AI‑enabled model that runs thousands of iterations, tracking how losses in platforms, munitions, and fuel compound over time and drive cascading operational failure early in the conflict.\n\nAccording to a Heritage spokesperson, the report had been shown to \"high-level national security officials\" who requested some of the specifics be crossed out in black ink before its release to the public. The report still details how quickly U.S. forces could reach a breaking point and why the conflict would carry global consequences.\n\n\"Redactions were made at the request of the U.S. government to prevent disclosure of information that could reasonably enable an adversary to (1) re mediate or ‘close’ critical vulnerabilities that the United States and its allies could otherwise exploit, or (2) identify or exploit U.S. and allied vulnerabilities in ways that could degrade operational endurance, resilience, or deterrence,\" the report said.\n\nA Department of War spokesperson declined to comment on discussions surrounding TIDALWAVE's publication, but added: \"The Department of War does not endorse, validate, or adjudicate third-party analyses, nor do we engage publicly on hypothetical conflict modeling. As a general matter, we take seriously the protection of information that, if aggregated or contextualized, could have implications for operational security.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nAccording to the report’s redacted findings, the U.S. would culminate in less than half the time required for the People's Republic of China in a high-intensity conflict. Culmination is defined as the point at which a force becomes incapable of continuing operations due to the loss of platforms, ammunition and/or fuel.\n\nThe report is explicit that the first 30 days to 60 days of a U.S.-China war determine its long-term shape and outcome, as early losses in aircraft, ships, fuel throughput and munitions rapidly compound and cannot be recovered on operationally relevant timelines.\n\nThe report concludes that the U.S. is not equipped nor arrayed to protect and sustain the Joint Force in a conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific. Rapid platform attrition, brittle logistics, concentrated basing and insufficient industrial surge capacity combine to force an early operational breaking point for American forces.\n\nThe report warns that U.S. reliance on a few large, concentrated forward bases — particularly in Japan and Guam — leaves American airpower dangerously exposed to Chinese missile forces.\n\nIn multiple scenarios, up to 90% of U.S. and allied aircraft positioned at major forward bases are destroyed on the ground during the opening phase of the conflict, as runways, fuel depots, command facilities and parked aircraft are hit simultaneously.\n\nThe report finds that critical U.S. precision‑guided munitions — including long‑range anti‑ship missiles, air‑to‑air interceptors and missile‑defense systems — begin to be unavailable within five to seven days of major combat operations. Across most scenarios, those critical munitions are completely exhausted within 35 days to 40 days, leaving U.S. forces unable to sustain high‑tempo combat.\n\nFuel emerges as the most decisive vulnerability of all. The report makes a critical distinction: the U.S. does not run out of fuel in most scenarios — it loses the ability to move fuel under fire.\n\nCHINA’S MISSILE SURGE PUTS EVERY US BASE IN THE PACIFIC AT RISK — AND THE WINDOW TO RESPOND IS CLOSING\n\nChinese doctrine explicitly prioritizes attacks on logistics vessels, ports, pipelines and replenishment tankers. Even limited tanker losses, port disruptions or pipeline severance are sufficient to drive fuel throughput below survivable levels, forcing commanders to sharply curtail air and naval operations despite fuel remaining in aggregate stockpiles.\n\nChinese ammunition stockpiles of critical munitions begin to be depleted after approximately 20 days to 30 days of major combat operations. However, substitution effects extend China’s ability to sustain combat operations out to months — well beyond the point at which U.S. forces culminate, according to the report.\n\nThe consequences extend far beyond the battlefield.\n\nThe redacted report concludes the U.S. is highly unlikely to prevent massive global economic fallout once a Taiwan conflict begins.\n\nDisruption of shipping lanes, destruction of critical infrastructure and the collapse of Taiwan’s semiconductor production would trigger a global economic shock estimated at roughly $10 trillion, with enduring ripple effects across financial markets, manufacturing and global trade.\n\nThe report comes amid years of concern over U.S. military readiness and industrial capacity, as China rapidly expands its naval forces and shipbuilding base.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates a smaller fleet than planned, while American shipyards face workforce shortages, aging infrastructure and chronic delays — even as China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, continues to outpace the U.S. in producing new naval hulls.\n\nWar Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders have vowed to put the Pentagon on a wartime footing for industrial capacity.\n\nPerhaps most alarming, TIDALWAVE warns that the scale of losses in the Indo‑Pacific would leave the U.S. unable to deter or respond effectively to a second major conflict elsewhere in the world.\n\nA war over Taiwan could open the door to follow‑on aggression by adversaries such as Russia, Iran or North Korea, fundamentally destabilizing the global security order.\n\nThe report is blunt in its assessment: existing Pentagon programs and congressional funding are too slow, too fragmented and too modest to address the scale of the challenge. In many cases, the timeline required to fix critical vulnerabilities exceeds the likely timeline to conflict.\n\nTo avoid what the authors describe as a strategic defeat, the report urges Congress to immediately expand munitions stockpiles, strengthen fuel reserves and distribution infrastructure, harden and disperse forward bases, and accelerate sustainment and logistics reforms. Without rapid action, the authors warn, the U.S. risks entering a conflict it is structurally unprepared to fight or sustain.\n\nWith intelligence warnings mounting that China could move on Taiwan before the end of the decade, TIDALWAVE cautions that the window to correct these deficiencies may be closing faster than Washington is prepared to act.",

    "description": "He isn't known for having the most refined palate, so it's no surprise that President Donald Trump eats this instead of the fancy food at state dinners.",
    "fullText": "A White House insider shared the go-to meal that President Donald Trump likes to fill up on before attending formal engagements with esteemed guests, and to absolutely no one's surprise, it's a burger. In an episode of the Daily Beast's show \"Inside Trump's Head,\" journalist Michael Wolff said the president eats a burger meal prior to attending state dinners. He reportedly pokes at the fancy food he's routinely served on the job, using the strategy of talking constantly to distract other attendees from noticing that he's barely eating.\n\nTrump has a well-documented love affair with fast food, dating back to his first term when he served a spread of burgers and pizza to the Clemson University football team after they won the college national championship. He favored fast food on the campaign trail for his second term, even stopping to pose for a now-famous photo op with McDonald's fries in hand. Trump has reportedly reasoned that eating fast food makes him relatable to average Americans.\n\nThe president's association with fast food earns him both praise and criticism. With his long history of showmanship, some observers, such as the users on Reddit's r/Pics, have even questioned whether his preferences are authentic or endorsed. But as Wolff confirmed, Trump's love for burgers is the real thing — even behind closed doors.\n\nFurther into the episode of \"In Trump's Head,\" Wolff reveals that staff traveling with Trump aboard Air Force One are given care packages of fast food as perks of the job. Apparently, most staff members don't eat the White House food, which Wolff describes as being bland and mass produced in banquet fashion — similar to something served at a wedding. When host Joanna Coles read through a menu of courses served at a 2018 state dinner in honor of French Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron, Wolff replied that Trump would not have touched any of it.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for what President Trump eats in a typical day to end up in the news or even his personal social media, perhaps lesser known is the fact that former presidents and their inner circles also favored burgers and fries. Fast food appears to have been woven into the culture in Washington for decades.
