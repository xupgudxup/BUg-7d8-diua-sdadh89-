    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "Marco Rubio was visibly irritated to be reminded that despite the capture of former president Nicolás Maduro, the dictator’s regime is still in power in Venezuela.\n\n“I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave [Maduro’s regime] intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife,” host Margaret Brennan questioned on Face the Nation Sunday, pointing out others in Maduro’s government who were indicted in the U.S.\n\n“I’m confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn’t you arrest them if you are taking out the narcoterrorist regime?” she asked.\n\n“You’re confused? I don’t know why that is confusing to you,” Rubio responded, with Brennan repeating: “They are still in power.”\n\nThe secretary of state lashed out at the CBS News host, saying that there was already enough “complaining” about the capture of just one Venezuelan politician—and that the military operation was difficult enough as it was.\n\n“You’re going to go in and suck up five people? They are already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people,” Rubio said.\n\n“We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife who is also indicted. That was a sophisticated, and frankly complicated operation.”\n\nAs Brennan agreed with the complexity of the raid, Rubio continued: “It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.\n\n“That’s not an easy mission. You’re asking me why didn’t we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that’s absurd.”\n\nRubio persisted in fawning over the operation, adding: “I do think it’s one of the most, you know, daring, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.\n\n“And today, an indicted drug trafficker—who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela, who we do not recognize, the Biden administration didn’t recognize, sixty-something countries don’t recognize, the European Union doesn’t recognize, and many countries in Latin America don’t recognize—he was an indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested, his wife was arrested—\"\n\nBrennan interjected and once again asked about the co-conspirators left behind. “Right, but the others who were also indicted are still in place, so that is the point of my questioning there. You talked about not being the legitimate president—\"\n\nRubio interrupted in turn, accusing: “So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?”\n\n“No, I’m asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. To your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president,” Brennan responded.\n\n“He was claiming to be the president,” said Rubio, speaking over Brennan again to specify: “He was the top target.”",

He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

The US has one military base, the Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.\n\n\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" Frederiksen said in her statement.\n\nThe Danish prime minister's statement comes after President Donald Trump's former aide, Katie Miller, posted an image on X of a map of Greenland superimposed with the US flag.\n\nThe Sunday post by Miller, who is married to White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was accompanied by the caption, \"SOON.\"\n\nAnd over recent years, Trump has repeatedly talked about the possibility of buying Greenland for US security and to tap into its trove of natural resources.\n\nJesper Møller Sørensen, the Danish ambassador to the US, responded to Miller's post, writing, \"Just a friendly reminder about the US and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such.\"\n\nSørensen added that he expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Sunday Facebook post, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nHe said he would not accept \"fantasies of annexation,\" and said that he found the US's messaging \"completely and utterly unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in August 2019, per a report that month by The Wall Street Journal. Greenland's foreign affairs ministry wrote in an X post in the same month, \"We're open for business, not for sale.\"\n\nIn a congressional address in March, shortly after commencing his second term, Trump said the US would take control of Greenland, \"One way or the other.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance also visited Greenland in March.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Frederiksen did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk joined Donald Trump for dinner during a packed weekend for the president, who was hosting meetings at Mar-a-Lago as his administration announced a US military operation in Venezuela.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a move that drew swift international reaction.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Musk wrote that he had \"a lovely dinner\" with Trump and first lady Melania Trump, adding: \"2026 is going to be amazing!\"\n\nThe photo posted on X shows the three of them seated at a dinner table, chatting. The dinner took place on Saturday evening at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to Fox News.\n\nHad a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS.\n\n2026 is going to be amazing! pic.twitter.com/1Oq35b1PEC\n\nThe dinner comes after a very public cooling of relations between Trump and Musk last year.\n\nIn November, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO attended a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — his first public appearance at the White House since falling out with Trump in June. The guest list included several top executives.\n\nAfter the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. \"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.\n\nThe relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.\n\nBefore the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies. He described himself as Trump's \"first buddy\" after the president's election win.\n\nMusk later played a central role in the administration's effort to cut government spending before leaving the post in May.\n\nTensions escalated after Musk criticized Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" prompting a public back-and-forth between the two men. Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.\n\nIn July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the \"America Party.\"\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk wrote in an X post. Trump fired back on his Truth Social platform, saying Musk had gone \"completely off the rails.\"",

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

Maduro has been indicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges and is now awaiting his first hearing in a notorious Brooklyn jail.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, though, Trump said that with Maduro removed from the country, the US would now look to tap the country's oil reserves.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called Venezuela's oil business a \"bust\" and \"nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping, and what could have taken place.\"\n\nWhile it's home to a fifth of the world's oil reserves, Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global daily crude production.\n\nTake a look at how its reserves compare to other countries.

    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "fullText": "American oil companies have long hoped to recover the assets that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime ripped from them decades ago.\n\nNow the Trump administration is offering to help them achieve that aim — with one major condition.\n\nAdministration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their rigs, pipelines and other seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela now and invest heavily in reviving its shattered petroleum industry, two people familiar with the administration's outreach told POLITICO on Saturday. The outlook for Venezuela’s shattered oil infrastructure is one of the major questions following the U.S. military action that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBut people in the industry said the administration’s message has left them still leery about the difficulty of rebuilding decayed oil fields in a country where it’s not even clear who will lead the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"They're saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’\" said one industry official familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe offer has been on the table for the last 10 days, the person said. “But the infrastructure currently there is so dilapidated that no one at these companies can adequately assess what is needed to make it operable.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested in a televised address Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to pour big money into Venezuela.\n\n“We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,\" Trump said as he celebrated Maduro’s capture.\n\nIt’s been five decades since the Venezuelan government first nationalized the oil industry and nearly 20 years since former President Hugo Chávez expanded the asset seizures. The country has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, but its petroleum infrastructure has decayed amid years of mismanagement and meager investment.\n\nInitial thoughts among U.S. oil industry officials and market analysts who spoke to POLITICO regarding a post-Maduro Venezuela focused more on questions than answers.\n\nThe administration has so far not laid out what its long-term plan looks like, or even if it has one, said Bob McNally, a former national security and energy adviser to President George W. Bush who now leads the energy and geopolitics consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.\n\n“It’s not clear there’s been a specific plan beyond the principal decision that in a post-Maduro, Trump-compliant regime that the U.S. companies — energy and others — will be at the top of the list” to reenter the country, McNally said. He added: “What the regime looks like, what the plans are for getting there, that has not been fully fleshed out yet.”",

    "description": "The US military has experience guarding oil infrastructure, but deploying troops to Venezuela comes with high risks in a dangerous environment.",
    "fullText": "On the heels of a high-stakes mission inside Venezuela's capital that captured its indicted leader to bring him to justice, President Donald Trump said his goal now was to get major US oil companies access to its huge reserves — even if it means deploying US troops.\n\n\"We're going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,\" Trump said in a Saturday press conference at Mar-a-Lago in reply to a question about whether the US military would have a presence there. \"So you may need something, not very much.\"\n\nVenezuela has one of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but deploying US troops to guard its oilfields and aging infrastructure comes with high risks and costs, military experts told Business Insider, and will require a stable security environment. This kind of operation may also require congressional authorization or additional funding.\n\n\"When you put US troops into a foreign country, there is going to be some resistance unless they are invited,\" said Peter Mansoor, a retired US Army colonel and professor of military history at the Ohio State University who is an expert in counterinsurgency warfare.\n\nMansoor, who commanded a brigade in Iraq, said US operations there are instructive, showing why sending US troops into Venezuela is the \"least desirable\" option. Iraqis themselves guarded their energy infrastructure, he said, which proved quite vulnerable to attack during the insurgency: Pipelines were bombed, mortars struck an oil refinery, trucks were hijacked only to have the oil sold on black markets.\n\n\"All of those things happened in Iraq, and they could happen here too if the Venezuelans allow an insurgency to erupt,\" said Mansoor, who is also a senior fellow at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies at OSU.\n\nMuch of Venezuela's operations are now managed by the state-run PDVSA oil company that took on assets that had belonged to US companies. Of US oil majors, only Chevron remains.\n\nVenezuela's future production is as murky as its tar-like extra-heavy crude. This type of oil is a large part of its massive oil reserves and requires a crude upgrader process to make it easier to move, an industry analyst said.\n\n\"All of that requires a lot of upfront investment,\" said Ben Cahill, an energy analyst at the University of Texas at Austin. \"So the Venezuelan oil sector presents some particular challenges. The reserves are enormous, and under the right political transition, and if a different investment regime returns, it is an opportunity that will be attractive to some companies.\"\n\nTo be sure, the US military has plenty of experience with energy infrastructure. Soldiers have patrolled near oil fields in eastern Syria. Warships and cutters guarded oil platforms off Iraq during the war and intercepted oil smugglers. A US task force more recently escorted ships, including tankers, threatened by missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea.\n\nAny US military mission in Venezuela turns on a turbulent situation where it's unclear who's in charge; Trump said at the press conference that US officials would be \"running\" Venezuela for a time.\n\n\"What's unclear here is who is actually the opponent,\" said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"Do we think we're going to have to send troops to go in and seize these oil fields rather than simply having the government of Venezuela change its model for managing them? At this point, it's unclear what exactly the protection is from and who would be doing it.\"\n\n\"So jumping ahead to say that the US military is going to now be protecting a bunch of oil facilities is premature,\" Clark said.\n\nOne thing that makes this national discussion so unusual is that it's so nakedly about oil access, unlike the stated justifications for the Persian Gulf war or the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\n\"The Trump administration has been very open about oil, even though they've tried to position this a little bit in terms of human rights,\" said Paul Poast, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a resident fellow at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs. \"What remains to be seen is how much planning went into the aftermath — which of course the US has a terrible track record with.\"",

Saying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress.",
    "fullText": "DALTON, Ga. (AP) — President Donald Trump says Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a traitor. But for Jackie Harling, who chairs the local Republican Party in Greene’s northwestern corner of Georgia, she’s still “mama bear.”\n\n“Every thought that we had in our minds, she seemed to be very good at verbalizing,” Harling said.\n\nSaying things that no one else would say may be Greene’s most durable legacy as she steps down on Monday, resigning halfway through her third term in Congress. First, it was her embrace of conspiracy theories and incendiary rhetoric, turning her into a national symbol of a political culture without guardrails. Then it was her willingness to criticize Trump, a schism that made her position in Washington untenable.\n\nIn interviews in Greene’s district, constituents described her over and over as a “fighter.” For Republicans like Harling, that was enough.\n\n“We got a lot of satisfaction,” Harling said. “She was our voice.”\n\nIt was less satisfying for an independent like Heath Patterson, who struggled to think of ways that Greene's fame and notoriety made a difference for her district during her time in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“I don’t know of anything that she did do here except, certainly, got her voice heard. But where did we, how did we benefit from that?” he said. “I don’t think we did.”\n\nGreene began clashing with Trump last year, criticizing his focus on foreign policy and his reluctance to release documents involving the Jeffrey Epstein case. The president eventually had enough, saying he would support a primary challenge against her. Greene announced a week later that she would resign.\n\nShe has kept up the criticism since then, including over Trump's decision to strike Venezuela this weekend.\n\n“This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end,” Greene wrote on social media on Saturday. “Boy were we wrong.”\n\nThe split was surprising because, until that point, Greene’s trajectory had mirrored Trump’s own rise to power. She didn’t become politically involved until his presidential campaign in 2016 and first ran for Congress in 2020. Greene considered trying to represent Georgia’s 6th congressional district, which includes the Atlanta suburbs, before relocating to the 14th, where the Republican incumbent was retiring.\n\nShe remained loyal to Trump after he lost to President Joe Biden, promoting his falsehoods about a stolen election. When Trump ran again in 2024, she toured the country with him and spoke at his rallies while wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nHer Georgia district is one of the most Republican-leaning in the state, although it wasn’t always that way. The region once backed Democrats like Zell Miller, a governor and U.S. senator who spearheaded Georgia’s lottery program that still bankrolls college scholarships and early childhood education programs.\n\nBut residents have felt left behind by years of change, said Jan Pourquoi, a Belgian native who emigrated in 1987, became a U.S. citizen and later won local office in Whitfield County.\n\nHis county’s population has grown by roughly by 32% since 1990, which pales in comparison to statewide growth of 74%. As the U.S. becomes more urban, secular, and diverse, Pourquoi said residents believe they’re “culturally oppressed.”\n\n“They see themselves as great Americans, proud Americans, Christian Americans, and that doesn’t fit the American model anymore as they see it,” said Pourquoi, who said he left the Republican Party because of Trump. Greene exemplified the political backlash, which he summarized as “stick it to them — any possible way you can.”\n\nGeorgia leaders, like those in many other states, have spent years drawing congressional districts to pack like-minded voters together. That means in red areas, whoever wins the Republican primary is virtually guaranteed to come out on top in the general election, incentivizing candidates like Greene with more hardline views.\n\nThe political landscape means former Republicans like Pourquoi or independents like Patterson say they have no shot at helping a centrist win.\n\n“I’m kind of square in the middle,” said Patterson, adding that it sometimes feels like he’s “the only one around here who’s that way.”\n\nRepublicans plan their path forward\n\nWhitfield County Republicans gathered at a local restaurant last month for their annual Christmas party, where seasonal decor and a visit from Santa Claus were intermingled with the red, white and blue regalia and a smattering of MAGA paraphernalia.\n\nThere was still deep affection for Greene and plenty of talk about the cultural issues she championed.\n\n“I think it’s just the fact that she was unwavering in ‘America First,’” said Gavin Swafford, who worked on Greene’s initial campaign.\n\nSwafford called her “an accountability representative” because of her clashes with Republican leaders.\n\nLisa Adams, a party volunteer, called Greene “our stand-up person.”\n\n“Look at her stance on transgenderism. That’s a big one,” she said. “Abortion. That’s a big one.”\n\nNone of Greene's inconsistencies — real or perceived — were a problem, they said.\n\nFor example, Greene has praised the Korean-owned solar panel factories in the district even after voting against Biden-era policies intended to boost production. She broke with Republicans, Trump included, and sided with Democrats who wanted to extend premium subsidies for Affordable Care Act health insurance customers.\n\nNone of the Republicans at the Christmas party expressed any interest in taking sides between Trump and Greene.\n\n“I think it’s inevitable when you have two firebrands that are both stubborn,” Swafford said.\n\nAsked whether the district missed having a more traditional lawmaker, the kind who might cut bipartisan deals and bring as much federal money as possible back home, Swafford was unconcerned.\n\n“The biggest thing that Marjorie contributed wasn’t even in legislation,\" he said.\n\nStill, there was also a sense among some that Greene, for all her bare-knuckle politics, could have gone further.\n\nStar Black, a Republican who is running to replace Greene, was already planning a primary challenge before she announced her resignation.\n\n“You had a great representative who was a fighter. Well, you know what? I want to take it one step further,” Black said.\n\n“Not only do you need a fighter,” Black said, “you need someone who is going to listen. You need someone who is going to represent you.”",

    "description": "Financial firms are planning trips to Venezuela to scout out new investment opportunities. Bill Ackman praised the move as \"good for America.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.\n\nHere's what they've been saying:\n\nMyers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the \"centerpiece\" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow \"faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.\"\n\nMyers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nBremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the \"US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'\"\n\nAccompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled \"SOF operation to capture Maduro,\" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned \"plans for future of Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,\" Bremmer added.\n\nIn a separate post, he wrote: \"The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.\"\n\nThe billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that \"The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.\"\n\nGao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in \"the brave new world of international law.\"\n\n\"Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,\" he continued. \"It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.\"\n\nThe Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, \"no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.\"\n\n\"What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?\" Warren wrote. \"The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.\"\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was \"heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.\"\n\nIn another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption \"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.\"\n\nMusk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.",

    "fullText": "Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nU.S. operations on Saturday represented America’s most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation’s 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.\n\nThe middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were being transported on a U.S. warship to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges in New York, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.\n\nProtesters gather in Los Angeles, elsewhere to protest US military action\n\nHundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela.\n\nPeople donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”\n\nA smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.\n\nAftermath of US military operation in Venezuela disrupts Caribbean travel\n\nThe U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy travel time for the region.\n\nElisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.\n\n“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said.\n\nShe spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won’t truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”\n\n“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”\n\n▶ Read more about travel disruptions here\n\nVenezuelans wonder who’s in charge as Trump claims contact with Maduro’s deputy Rodríguez\n\nUncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.\n\nTrump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro’s most trusted aides.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro’s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.\n\n“She’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump’s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.\n\nIn her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”\n\n▶ Read more about the reaction within Venezuela\n\nMaduro’s ouster sparks celebrations among Venezuelans in South Florida\n\nRevelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro’s capture and removal from the country.\n\nFor some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.\n\nPeople gathered for a rally in Doral, the Miami suburb where Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent.\n\nOutside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by others hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”\n\n“We’re like everybody — it’s a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There’s fears. There’s excitement. There’s so many years that we’ve been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”\n\nBlack lawmakers in Congress condemn ‘illegal’ US actions in Venezuela\n\nThe Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”\n\n“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.\n\n“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.\n\nPerson in custody seen gingerly leaving plane believed to be carrying Maduro\n\nAt around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro.\n\nThe person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents.\n\nSeveral agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.\n\nCanadian PM stands by Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to build future\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people.\n\nCarney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nCarney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people’s sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”\n\nSeizing control of Venezuela’s oil presents legal issues for US, law professor says\n\nMatthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela’s resources opens up additional legal issues.\n\n“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela’s oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can’t enrich itself by taking another state’s resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”\n\nBut Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we’ve seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”\n\nJUST IN: Plane carrying deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro arrives in New York following his capture by US, AP source says German leader calls for stability in Venezuela\n\nChancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn’t recognize his presidency after the South American nation’s last election.\n\nMerz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.\n\nHe said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it’s important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”\n\nSchumer says Trump actions in Venezuela ‘reckless’\n\nThe Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.\n\n“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.\n\nRubio hints Cuba could be next after Trump takes Maduro out of Venezuela\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration’s push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro.\n\nVenezuela's UN ambassador says his country has right to self defense\n\nIn a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.”\n\nThe letter from Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.\n\n“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: this is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world’s largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.\n\nTrump says Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as president\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed that Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodríguez had been sworn in as president shortly before he spoke to reporters and added she had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\n“She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,” Trump said.\n\nEarlier, opposition leader María Corina Machado said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump shares photo of captured Maduro\n\nThe president posted a photo on social media showing Maduro wearing a sweatsuit and a blindfold with the caption: “Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima.”\n\nMaduro appeared to be wearing a flotation device around his neck. Next to him was someone wearing a jacket that had a DEA logo.\n\nMaduro also had protective headphones on his ears and appeared to be lifting a water bottle with both arms to drink.\n\nTrump’s action against Maduro contrasts with clemency granted to ex-Honduras leader\n\nTrump’s dramatic action against Maduro is the polar opposite of the clemency he granted to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández.\n\nTrump in December pardoned Hernández though he was sentenced to 45 years in U.S. prison for helping drug traffickers to safely move hundreds of tons of cocaine north through his country to the U.S.\n\nHernández, who enjoyed support from officials in the first Trump administration, was convicted by a U.S. jury in New York — which Maduro is now set to face.\n\nWhen asked in an interview with Politico about the pardon, Trump said, “I don’t know him” and “I know very little about him,” but added that he was told that Hernández “was set up.”\n\n“The country, uh, deals in drugs, like probably you could say that about every country, and because he was the president, they gave him like 45 years in prison,” he said.\n\nJustice Department released a new indictment of Maduro and wife\n\nThe indictment accuses Maduro of leading a “a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking.” It alleges that the drug trafficking efforts “enriched and entrenched Venezuela’s political and military elite.”\n\nU.S. authorities allege that Maduro partnered with “some of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world” to bring tons of cocaine into the U.S., according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities estimate that as much as 250 tons of cocaine were trafficked through Venezuela by 2020, according to the indictment. The drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or via planes from clandestine airstrips, authorities allege.\n\nUN is ‘deeply alarmed’ by the US strike\n\nThe United Nations said it was “deeply alarmed” by the U.S. strikes and reported detention of President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela. It expressed concern that the escalation was a violation of international law.\n\n“These developments constitute a dangerous precedent,” Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said in a statement. Dujarric said the U.N. worried about the larger implications for Latin America and the Caribbean and called on “all actors in Venezuela” to respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\nChina slams US strike in Venezuela\n\nChina strongly condemned the U.S. strike in Venezuela and the action against its president, the Foreign Ministry said, adding the Beijing government was “deeply shocked” and firmly opposed to the operation.\n\n“Such hegemonic acts of the U.S. seriously violate international law and Venezuela’s sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region,” it said.\n\nIt called on the U.S. to comply with international law and the principles of the U.N. Charter, urging it to stop violating the sovereignty and security of other nations.\n\nTrump says a helicopter was hit and ‘a few’ US members were injured in Venezuela\n\nTrump said a helicopter was hit during the operation in Venezuela and a few U.S. members were injured, but he believed none were killed.\n\n“A couple of guys were hit, but they came back and they’re supposed to be in pretty good shape,” he said.\n\nHe said the U.S. lost no aircraft in the operation.\n\n“We got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard but—a helicopter—but we got it back.\n\n“We had to do it because it’s a war,” he added a few moments later.\n\nTrump dismisses criticism he did not seek congressional permission for Venezuela strike\n\nTrump brushed off criticism from U.S. Democratic lawmakers that he did not seek permission from Congress ahead of time and that the strike was illegal. He called his Democratic critics “weak, stupid people” and blaming his political opponents for inflation in the U.S.\n\nHe said the operation in Venezuela was “really genius.”\n\n“All they do is complain,” he said of the Democrats.\n\n“They should say, ‘Great job.’ They shouldn’t say, ‘Oh Gee, maybe it’s not constitutional.’ You know, the same old stuff that we’ve been hearing for years and years and years,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says he proposed to the Mexican president that US take out cartels\n\nTrump said the operation in Venezuela “wasn’t meant to be” a message to Mexico, but then he has proposed to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum that the U.S. “take out” cartels in her country and suggested the U.S. might take action.\n\n“We’re very friendly with her, she’s a good woman. But the cartels are running Mexico. She’s not running Mexico. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he’s asked Sheinbaum numerous times, “Would you like us to take out the cartels?” but she has said no.\n\n“Something’s going to have to be done with Mexico,” Trump said.\n\nTrump says US will decide on what’s next for Venezuela\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in an interview Saturday morning that the United States will be making decisions on what is next for Venezuela after capturing the Latin American country’s president and flying him out of the country.\n\n“We’ll be involved in it very much” as to who will govern the country, Trump said.\n\n“We can’t take a chance in letting somebody else run and just take over what he left, or left off,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News hours after the capture.\n\nMaduro was at his home when he was seized in US operation, party leader tells AP\n\nVenezuelan ruling party leader Nahum Fernández told The Associated Press that Nicolás Maduro and his wife were at their home within the Ft. Tiuna military installation when they were captured.\n\n“That’s where they bombed,” he said. “And, there, they carried out what we could call a kidnapping of the president and the first lady of the country.”\n\nEuropean leaders react to Maduro’s capture by the US\n\n— EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the EU ambassador in Caracas. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”\n\n— Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called for “de-escalation and responsibility. International Law and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected,” Sánchez wrote on X.\n\n— Russia’s Foreign Ministry said it is “extremely alarmed” and called for “immediate clarification,” according to a statement posted Saturday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. The ministry said such actions, if confirmed, would constitute “an unacceptable infringement on the sovereignty of an independent state.”\n\n— British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the U.K. was not involved in the U.S. operation in Venezuela and that he would seek more information from Trump. Without condemning the U.S. action, Starmer said he always believes that international law should be upheld. “But I think at this stage, fast moving situation, let’s establish the facts and take it from there,” he said.\n\nUS indicted Maduro on narcoterrorism charges in 2020\n\nThe Justice Department during Trump’s first term in office charged in the several indictments that Maduro had effectively converted Venezuela into a criminal enterprise at the service of drug traffickers and terrorist groups as he and his allies stole billions from the South American country.\n\nThe coordinated unsealing of indictments against 14 officials and government-connected individuals, and rewards of $55 million for Maduro and four others, attacked all the key planks of what then-Attorney General William Barr called the “corrupt Venezuelan regime,” including the Maduro-dominated judiciary and the powerful armed forces.\n\nOne indictment by prosecutors in New York accused Maduro and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, head of the rubber-stamping constitutional assembly, of conspiring with Colombian rebels and members of the military “to flood the United States with cocaine” and use the drug trade as a “weapon against America.”\n\nRead our news report from 2020 on the charges\n\nRussia calls US action ‘an act of armed aggression’\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it called a U.S. “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela in a statement posted on its Telegram channel Saturday.\n\n“Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, outside intervention,” the statement said.\n\nThe ministry called for dialogue to prevent further escalation and said it reaffirmed its “solidarity” with the Venezuelan people and government, adding that Russia supports calls for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting.",

    "description": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — serving out her final days before stepping down from Congress — ripped President Trump's decision to strike Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) — serving out her final days before stepping down from Congress — ripped President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Venezuela.\n\nIn a post to X on Saturday, Greene lashed out at the administration justifying the move on the grounds that they were looking to combat narco-terrorism.\n\n“I’ve served on the Homeland Security Committee for the past three years,” Greene wrote. “I’m 100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America. Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of U.S. drug overdose deaths and fentanyl comes from Mexican cartels made with chemical precursors from China and trafficked across the U.S. Mexico border. Mexican cartels are primarily and overwhelmingly responsible for killing Americans with deadly drugs. If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn’t the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels? And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America? Ironically cocaine is the same drug that Venezuela primarily traffics into the U.S.”\n\nThe next obvious observation is that by removing Maduro this is a clear move for control over Venezuelan oil supplies that will ensure stability for the next obvious regime change war in Iran.\n\nAnd of course why is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I’m not endorsing Russia or China)\n\nThe congresswoman, in a subsequent post went on to blast the idea of ousting the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, through a military action.\n\n“Regime change, funding foreign wars, and American’s (sic) tax dollars being consistently funneled to foreign causes, foreigners both home and abroad, and foreign governments while Americans are consistently facing increasing cost of living, housing, healthcare, and learn about scams and fraud of their tax dollars is what has most Americans enraged,” Greene wrote. “Especially the younger generations. Boomers and half of Gen X will cheer on neocon wars and talking points, but the other half of Gen X and majority on down see through it and hate it. Americans (sic) disgust with our own government’s never ending military aggression and support of foreign wars is justified because we are forced to pay for it and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, always keep the Washington military machine funded and going.”\n\nGreene added, “This is what many in MAGA thought they voted to end. Boy were we wrong.”\n\nAnd in a subsequent post following Trump’s announcement that the U.S. will “run” Venezuela, Greene expressed her disgust with a facepalm emoji.\n\nhttps://x.com/mtgreenee/status/2007505789108543761?s=20\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Rips Trump’s Strike on Venezuela: ‘MAGA Thought They Voted to End’ This — ‘Boy Were We Wrong’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”",
    "fullText": "On November 2, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that land strikes in Venezuela would require the approval of Congress. She said that if Trump “were to authorize some activity on land, then it’s war, then (we’d need) Congress.”\n\nDays later, Trump administration officials privately told members of Congress much the same thing – that they lacked the legal justification to support attacks against any land targets in Venezuela.\n\nJust two months later, though, the Trump administration has done what it previously indicated it couldn’t.\n\nIt launched what Trump called a “large scale strike against Venezuela” and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, to face charges. And it launched this regime change effort without the approval of Congress.\n\n(Trump in November claimed he didn’t need congressional authorization for land action, but it clearly wasn’t the consensus view in the administration.)\n\nIt appears the mission is, for now, limited to removing Maduro. But as Trump noted, it did involve striking inside the country – the same circumstance some in the administration previously indicated required authorization that it didn’t have. CNN reported back in early November that the administration was seeking a new legal opinion from the Justice Department for such strikes.\n\nAnd Trump in a news conference Saturday spoke repeatedly about not just arresting Maduro, but also running Venezuela and taking over its oil – comments that could certainly be understood to suggest this was about more than arresting Maduro.\n\nLegally dubious strikes inside another country – even ones narrowly tailored at removing a foreign leaders – are hardly unheard of in recent American history. But even in that context, this one is remarkable.\n\nThat’s because the Trump administration has taken remarkably little care to offer a consistent set of justifications or a legal framework for the attack. And it doesn’t even appear to have notified Congress ahead of time, which is generally the bare minimum in such circumstances.\n\nA full explanation of the claimed justification has yet to be issued, but the early signs are characteristically confusing.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah said shortly after the strikes that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him the attack was needed to, in Lee’s words, “protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant” against Maduro.\n\n“This action likely falls within the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,” said Lee, a frequent critic of unauthorized foreign military action.\n\nHours later, Vice President JD Vance echoed that line.\n\n“And PSA for everyone saying this was ‘illegal’: Maduro has multiple indictments in the United States for narcoterrorism,” Vance said on X. “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.”\n\nAt a later news conference, Rubio echoed the line that the military had been supporting “a law enforcement function.”\n\nBut there are many people living in other countries that are under indictment in the United States; it is not the US government’s usual course to launch strikes on foreign countries to bring them to justice.\n\nThe administration also hadn’t previously indicated that military force could be legally used for this reason.\n\nInitially, Trump threatened land strikes inside Venezuela to target drug traffickers – this despite Venezuela being an apparently somewhat small player in the drug-trafficking game.\n\nLater, the administration suggested strikes might be needed because Venezuela sent bad people into the United States.\n\nAnd then, after initially downplaying the role of oil in the US pressure campaign against Venezuela and Maduro, Trump said he aimed to reclaim “the oil, land, and other assets that they previously stole from us.”\n\nThe signals were confusing enough that even the hawkish Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in mid-December indicated the administration lacked “clarity” in its messaging.\n\n“I want clarity right here,” Graham said. “President Trump is saying his days are numbered. That seems to me that he’s gotta go. If it’s the goal of taking him out because he’s a threat to our country, then say it. And what happens next? Don’t you think most people want to know that?”\n\nDespite the focus on the law enforcement operation on Saturday, Trump at the news conference said the United States would now participate in running Venezuela, at least temporarily. And he repeatedly spoke about its oil.\n\n“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure,” Trump said, adding at another point: “We’re going to run the country right.”\n\nAnd even if the administration had offered a more consistent justification, that doesn’t mean it would be an appropriate one.\n\nThe most recent major example of using the US military for regime change is, of course, the war in Iraq. That war was authorized by Congress in 2002. The broader war on terror was authorized by Congress in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nSince then, administrations have sought to justify several military actions in the Middle East using those authorizations – sometimes dubiously. But Venezuela is in an entirely different theater.\n\nWhile many have compared the effort in Venezuela to Iraq, the better comparison – and one the administration apparently intends to make – is Panama in 1989.\n\nLike in Venezuela, Panama’s leader at the time, Manuel Noriega, was under US indictment, including for drug-trafficking. And like in Venezuela, the operation was less a large-scale war than a narrowly tailored effort to remove the leader from power.\n\nThe Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 1980 had concluded that the FBI didn’t have the authority to apprehend and abduct a foreign national to face justice. But George H.W. Bush administration’s OLC quietly reversed that in the summer of 1989.\n\nA memo written by William P. Barr, who would later become attorney general in that Bush administration and Trump’s first administration, said a president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, even if it violated international law to do so.\n\nThat memo was soon used to justify the operation to remove Noriega. (As it happens, Noriega was captured the same day Maduro was: January 3,1990.)\n\nBut that memo remains controversial to this day. It’s also an extraordinarily broad grant of authority, potentially allowing US military force anywhere\n\nAnd the situation in Venezuela could differ in that it’s a larger country that could prove tougher to control with its leader in foreign custody. It also has significant oil wealth, meaning other countries could take an interest in what happens there next. (China has called the attack a “blatant use of force against a sovereign state.”)\n\nIn both the news conference and an interview with Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump invoked the possibility of further military option, reinforcing that this could be about more than just arresting Maduro.\n\nThat also means the questions about Trump’s legal authorities could again be tested – just as he’s already tested them with his legally dubious strikes on alleged drug boats and other actions in the region.\n\nWhat’s clear is that Trump is seeking to yet again test the limits of his authority as president – and Americans’ tolerance for it. But this time he’s doing it on one of the biggest stages yet. And the story of his stretching of the law certainly isn’t over.",

    "description": "John...",
    "fullText": "Senators and House members accuse Trump and his aides of disregarding the Constitution and lying to Congress.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Saturday at 3:21 am, “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country. This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement. Details to follow.”\n\nHours later, during a congratulatory press conference, Trump said that during a period of transition in Venezuela, “we’re going to run the country right.” But he gave only limited details of how the process would proceed, aside from saying, “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground.” Trump dwelt more on talk of prosecuting Maduro and his wife in a New York City courtroom.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi had already taken to social media earlier on Saturday morning with a message :“Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been indicted in the Southern District of New York. Nicolas Maduro has been charged with Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States. They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.”\n\nBut in a brief predawn call with a New York Times reporter, Trump refused to discuss whether “he had sought congressional authority for the operation or what is next for Venezuela.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio later acknowledged that there had been no pre-attack consultation.\n\nAs it became clear that leaders of the Senate and House Armed Services committees had not been consulted on the regime-change attack and as confusion mounted about what would happen next in Venezuela, key members of Congress—who have the constitutionally defined authority to declare wars and to oversee major military actions—reacted angrily to what had transpired in the name of the United States but without the consent of the legislative branch.\n\n“A US invasion of Venezuela to depose its president and arrest him is illegal,” Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, told NPR Saturday morning. Kaine promised to seek a Senate vote next week to declare that Trump should not be waging this “unilateral presidentially declared war against Venezuela” without congressional authorization.\n\nKaine, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement arguing, “President Trump’s unauthorized military attack on Venezuela to arrest Maduro—however terrible he is—is a return to a day when the United States asserted a right to dominate the internal affairs of all nations in the Western Hemisphere. The history is replete with failures, and doubling down on it makes it difficult to the claim with a straight face to other countries should respect the United States’ sovereignty when we do not do the same.”\n\n“Where will this go next?” asked Kaine. “Will the President deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies? Trump has threatened to do all this and more and sees no need to seek legal authorization from people’s elected legislature before putting servicemembers at risk.”\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who has been one of the House’s most consistent critics of undeclared wars, warned that Trump has disregarded the Constitution. “President Trump has repeatedly been told he must consult with and get authorization from Congress to go to war, per US law. While we are only seeing early public accounts of what happened, it is clear he acted without doing that,” Pocan said. “Trump not notifying Democratic leadership, much less rank-and-file members, continues the degradation of the rule of law.”\n\nRepresentative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat who serves on the Military and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs, said, “Trump’s regime change war in Venezuela is flat out illegal and yet another betrayal of the commitments he made to the American people. He said he’d lower prices. He’s driving prices up. He said no ‘new stupid wars.’ He’s starting new stupid wars.”\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) initially went on social media and wrote, “I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”\n\nLater, after receiving a call from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Lee made feeble excuses for the administration, claiming that the assault “likely” was justified by fears of “an actual or imminent attack.” But Washington Post national security analyst Josh Rogan wrote, “The United States has just kidnapped a foreign head of state and bombed a foreign capital using the justification of protecting U.S. personnel from an ‘actual or imminent attack’ according to Senator Lee. Make no mistake, President Trump just committed an act of war against Venezuela.”\n\nThe New York Times adopted a similar view in an editorial headlined “Trump’s Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise.”\n\nAnd Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dismissed claims by the president and the attorney general about the reasons for the regime change. “It’s not about drugs. If it was, Trump wouldn’t have pardoned one of the largest narco traffickers in the world [former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández] last month. It’s about oil and regime change. And they need a trial now to pretend that it isn’t. Especially to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.”\n\nRepresentative Thomas Massie (R-KY) also expressed skepticism. “If this action were constitutionally sound,” Massie wrote on X, “the Attorney General wouldn’t be tweeting that they’ve arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law.”\n\nMaduro, according to election observers, almost certainly lost the 2024 presidential election and then refused to step down. Yet he had recently signaled an openness to meeting with Trump to discuss US allegations about drug trafficking and other issues. Trump has now executed a secret plan to remove the Venezuelan leader, even after Trump’s aides had denied regime-change plans.\n\nSenator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who served as a national security adviser under President Barack Obama, accused Trump’s secretaries of state and defense of lying to Congress about the administration’s intensions. “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn’t about regime change,” Kim said in a statement amid the first reports of US air strikes on Caracas. “I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress. Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.”\n\nKim explained, “This strike doesn’t represent strength. It’s not sound foreign policy. It puts Americans at risk in Venezuela and the region, and it sends a horrible and disturbing signal to other powerful leaders across the globe that targeting a head of state is an acceptable policy for the U.S. government. This will further damage our reputation—already hurt by Trump’s policies around the world—and only isolate us in a time when we need our friends and allies more than ever.”\n\nSenator Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, “We have no vital national interests in Venezuela to justify war. We should have learned not to stumble into another stupid adventure by now.”\n\nSenator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who served in the US Marines from 2002 to 2006 and was deployed during the war in Iraq, bluntly declared, “This war is illegal.” “There is no justification for the United States to be at war with Venezuela. I lived through the consequences of an illegal war sold to the American people with lies,” explained Gallego. “We swore we would never repeat those mistakes. Yet here we are again. The American people did not ask for this, Congress did not authorize this, and our service members should not be sent into harm’s way for another unnecessary conflict.”",

Other officials revealed that intelligence, space, and cyber assets were involved as well.\n\nDuring the press conference, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, involved over 150 aircraft, including fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, helicopters, and drones.\n\nSome assets disabled Venezuelan defenses and provided cover, while others were involved in infiltration and extraction.\n\nThe US president said that the assault targeted \"a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas,\" where Maduro was captured during the night. He added that the US used \"certain expertise\" to turn off the lights in Caracas and that the Venezuelan military was overwhelmed by US forces.\n\nAmong the most important discussion points of the president's press conference is that the US will run Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition.\"\n\nExactly how the Trump administration plans to do this, and for how long, remains unknown. By law, Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, should assume power. Trump added that Rodríguez \"really doesn't have a choice\" but to accept US involvement.\n\nWhen speaking on who would be in charge of this plan, Trump pointed to the officials standing behind him at the conference, including Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Caine.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said, the biggest US oil companies will be going to Venezuela to \"spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"\n\nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves. The US has been seizing and blockading oil tankers in recent months as part of the escalating tension between Maduro and the Trump administration. Trump has said the US built Venezuela's oil industry and intends to take it back, accusing Caracas of using the money to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nDuring the conference, Trump said the US was ready to conduct a second attack, \"a much bigger wave,\" on Venezuela if needed.\n\n\"We actually assumed that a second wave would be necessary, but now it's probably not,\" the president said, pointing to the success of the first attack.",

    "fullText": "US troops and a helicopter came under fire during the operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump said on Saturday, revealing new details about the overnight raid.\n\nTrump, speaking to Fox News, said American forces stormed what he described as a \"very highly guarded\" building, \"like a fortress,\" and closed in on Maduro before he could reach a \"safety space\" surrounded by steel.\n\n\"I think we had nobody killed, I have to say, because a couple of guys were hit. But they came back, and they're supposed to be in pretty good shape,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We lost no aircraft; everything came back — we got it all back. One of them was hit pretty hard — a helicopter — but we got it back,\" the president added.\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions about Trump's comments to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for additional information.\n\nTrump earlier said the US had carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela, capturing Maduro and his wife and flying them out of the country. The operation, he said, was done in coordination with American law enforcement.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York and charged with various drug-related offenses. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" she added.\n\nVideo footage shared on social media showed helicopters flying low to the ground in Venezuela. Caracas said American forces targeted military and civilian areas and strongly condemned the strikes.\n\nSpeaking on Fox, Trump said that the US \"turned off almost all of the lights in Caracas.\" He described the raid as being \"very organized,\" with American forces working under near total darkness.\n\nHe declined to say which American forces participated in the raid. He said only that they're \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nHe said the operation was planned with \"pinpoint\" accuracy, and that the US \"built a house which was identical to the one they went into\" — a tactic similar to what the US did ahead of the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan.\n\nThe US has built up a massive military presence in the Caribbean Sea in recent months, gathering advanced warships, fighter jets, and an aircraft carrier, with the White House repeatedly threatening military action against Venezuela. He accused the country's leadership of facilitating drug-trafficking — claims Maduro rejected.\n\nUS forces have carried out dozens of strikes against alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing over 100 people, and seized multiple Venezuela-linked oil tankers in the region.\n\nLast month, US media reported that the CIA carried out a drone strike inside Venezuela, marking the first known operation in the country since Trump's pressure campaign began. At that time, it was unclear whether he intended to escalate further.\n\n\"We were going to do this four days ago, but the weather was not perfect,\" Trump said of the operation to capture Maduro during his interview with Fox on Saturday. \"We had just the perfect weather.\"\n\nThe president later said that the US is going to be strongly involved in Venezuela's oil industry moving forward.\n\nSeveral leaders of countries in the region quickly condemned the strikes in Venezuela. Democratic US lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for the operation, while some Republicans voiced their support.",

    "fullText": "The US executed targeted, large-scale attacks in Venezuela's capital city, Caracas, overnight.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Saturday American forces struck the country's military, turned off the lights in the city, and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for prosecution in New York.\n\nThe assault news has raised big questions. Here's what we know right now.\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Trump revealed on Truth Social that the US military carried out a \"large-scale attack against Venezuela\" and that the leader had been captured and taken out of the country.\n\nThe US president didn't seek Congressional approval prior to the mission. Congress, however, was notified afterward.\n\nTrump told Fox News he watched the capture of Maduro play out in real time from a room inside his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida alongside military generals.\n\n\"I was told by real military people that there's no other country on Earth that can do such a maneuver,\" he shared during a phone interview with Fox News. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show.\"\n\nTrump said the raid was \"extremely complex,\" more so than the Midnight Hammer operation against Iran's nuclear sites conducted last year. Maduro and his wife were taken to the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima.\n\nTrump said US assets involved included land, air, and sea, including a \"massive number\" of aircraft and troops. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said the apprehension mission, called Absolute Resolve, was based on months of intelligence-gathering, including watching Maduro's patterns of life, and involved all elements of the joint force, from space and cyber assets to traditional combat forces.\n\nThe assault involved 150 aircraft — fighter jets, bombers, electronic warfare planes, intelligence and surveillance aircraft, and helicopters and rotary aircraft — that provided \"layered effects\" to clear the way for the interdiction force to slip in with the \"element of surprise\" into downtown Caracas. Fighters and different drones covered the extraction.\n\nThere were no US personnel or equipment losses, Trump said; however, he did say that troops were hit, along with a helicopter that he said was hit \"pretty hard.\" Caine said the US responded to hostile fire with \"overwhelming\" force.\n\nTensions have been rising for months between Venezuela's Maduro regime and the Trump administration, which has ramped up its rhetoric while increasing military action nearby.\n\nThe US has blamed Venezuela for pushing deadly drugs into the country, as well as using its oil industry, which the Trump administration says the US built and intends to take back, to fund narco-terrorism and other criminal activities.\n\nThe administration has labeled cartels and the Maduro regime terrorist organizations. Trump has also called Maduro an illegitimate leader.\n\nThe US has been launching attacks against alleged drug trafficking boats since September 2025, with over 100 people killed and others missing or captured.\n\nA massive US force presence, including warships and combat aircraft, has been in the Caribbean to combat narcotics trafficking and pressure Venezuela for months.\n\nMore recently, US forces began executing a blockade of oil tankers out of Venezuela in an effort to enforce American oil sanctions, hurting a key Venezuelan export and straining its economy.\n\nMaduro's government said that the purpose of the US attack on Venezuela was to \"seize Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals, in an attempt to forcibly break the nation's political independence.\"\n\nThe US has removed the leaders of sovereign states in the past. For instance, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, or Operation Iraqi Freedom, it captured Saddam Hussein after the Bush administration asserted the Iraqi president had weapons of mass destruction. Hussein was later convicted for crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court and executed in December 2006.\n\nA lack of evidence that Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction led to criticisms against the Bush administration's motives.\n\nMuch earlier, Panamanian military dictator Manual Noriega was also a target of American military forces during the US invasion of Panama from December 1989 to January 1990, partially prompted by his attempt to annul the results of the 1989 Panamanian general election. US courts had charged Noriega with drug smuggling and money laundering, and the Panamanian official was captured in January 1990 and taken to Miami, where he was convicted on most of the charges.\n\nBoth Noriega and Maduro were heads of state indicted by US federal courts, they were accused of using state power to facilitate drug trafficking, and the US could argue in both cases those actions taken against them were law enforcement.\n\nThe US has also conducted military action to kill prominent foreign figures. Exactly six years ago, US military personnel successfully assassinated Qasem Soleimani, a senior Iranian military officer, in a drone strike in Baghdad.\n\nThe US designated Soleimani a terrorist in 2005. In response to Soleimani's assassination in January 2020, Iran launched missiles against US military bases in Iraq, injuring 110 US troops.\n\nMaduro and his wife are on their way to New York. Pamela Bondi, US attorney general, said that Maduro had been charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices, as well as conspiracy against the US.\n\n\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said on X.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump posted a picture of Maduro in custody on Truth Social. The photo showed Maduro aboard USS Iwo Jima.\n\nThe president also added that US oil companies would be returning to Venezuela.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's pressure campaign against Venezuela is reminiscent of the U.S.'s catastrophic invasion of Iraq, as it relies on exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats to justify its actions, potentially leading to the same disastrous consequences.",
    "fullText": "Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard rappelled from a helicopter onto the deck of the Centuries, an oil tanker that had last left port in Venezuela. It was the second Venezuelan-linked tanker detained by U.S. forces in the Caribbean in December, while a third tanker was sought by the U.S Coast Guard.\n\nThe seizures were framed as routine enforcement of sanctions. But to many observers, they looked like something else: a crude show of force that revived uncomfortable memories of how easily oil, security, and moral justification blur when Washington wants war.\n\nAs the Trump administration escalates its pressure campaign against Venezuela, it is becoming increasingly clear that the only lessons America absorbed from its catastrophic invasion of Iraq were the wrong ones.\n\nThe White House’s deadliest error is its indulgence in motivated reasoning. Like the Bush administration before it, Trump’s administration is seemingly placing his enthusiasm for toppling a dictator over facts or strategic planning.\n\nThe administration recently labelled fentanyl a chemical “weapon of mass destruction” — echoing the falsehood that George W. Bush used to drag the U.S. into Iraq in 2003. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has since accused Nicolás Maduro of working with “narco-traffickers and narco-terrorists” — reviving memories of George W. Bush’s unfounded obsession with an alliance between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein.\n\nThis rhetoric comes amid allegations of human rights violations over the administration’s drone campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats from Venezuela. Last month, Trump said he was not ruling out war. It is tempting to conclude that our leaders learned nothing from Iraq. The truth is darker. They learned that exaggeration, fearmongering, and the fabrication of existential threats can still work.\n\nNow that cynical logic is being aimed at a neighbor in the Americas. Latin America is no stranger to Washington’s interventions, but recycling the rhetorical playbook of the most catastrophic blunder in modern U.S. history signals to the region — and to the world — that America remains unable, or unwilling, to control its worst instincts.\n\nPolitical memory is short, but the costs of the Iraq War were enormous. While the initial invasion was swift and militarily successful, what followed was nearly a decade of violent counterinsurgency, in which more than 4,400 American servicemembers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed — mainly civilians.\n\nYet the lesson U.S. leaders appear to have drawn is not that wars like Iraq should be rare, limited and meticulously planned. Instead, they learned that no administration remains in power forever, and that a president can claim the initial victory while leaving the eventual reckoning to a successor.\n\nIn Iraq, shamefully little attention was paid to planning for what came beyond President George W. Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” speech in 2003. The dismantling of the Iraqi state created power vacuums that spawned and nurtured extremist pro-Saddam militias, al-Qaeda in Iraq, and eventually ISIS.\n\nThe deeper lesson was not merely that invasion breeds instability, but that ungoverned spaces accelerate extremist ideology and transnational violence.\n\nThe same dynamic could unfold in Venezuela. Latin America has a long history of insurgency, from FARC in Colombia, the Zapatistas in Mexico, and the Shining Path in Peru. Just as disbanded Ba’athist forces gravitated towards militias and terror groups after 2004, fractured Venezuelan security forces could easily be absorbed into criminal-terrorist ecosystems that already exist. Under Maduro, Venezuela has worked with Colombian guerrilla groups and illicit trafficking networks, while cultivating ties with Hezbollah.\n\nVenezuela presents some risks even greater than Iraq. The Maduro regime is recruiting and arming militias, and preparing troops for a guerrilla war.\n\nWhen Iraq collapsed and the army disbanded, al-Qaeda wasted little time in recruiting newly unemployed soldiers. It is in this space that organizations such as the Muslim World League have sought to intervene globally — not as security actors, but as religious authorities capable of challenging extremist narratives at their root.\n\nUnder the leadership of its Secretary-General, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the Muslim World League has focused on stripping violent movements of religious legitimacy by building cross-sectarian consensus against the politicization of faith. Its 2019 Charter of Makkah — endorsed by more than 1,200 Sunni, Shia, and minority-sect scholars from 139 countries — explicitly rejects religious supremacy, sectarian violence, and the use of theology to justify terror. That effort reflects lessons drawn from conflicts like Iraq, where the collapse of state authority was compounded by the absence of a shared moral framework capable of resisting extremist capture.\n\nVenezuela lacks an equivalent religious or institutional counterweight. An intervention would risk repeating Iraq’s gravest mistake: tearing down a state in an environment already primed for extremist and criminal consolidation.\n\nThe cautionary lessons that should have restrained American power are instead being rewritten as a playbook for war. The administration is selling the illusion of strength for short-term political gain, at the cost of American credibility, stability and lives.\n\nIraq should have ended this way of thinking. Venezuela suggests it never did.\n\nPaulina Velasco is chief of staff for the Los Angeles City Council and a Democratic political strategist. She is also a journalist who has been published in The Hill, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC), and Dallas Morning News, among others.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly ordered his motorcade to stop at a Florida strip mall Friday morning so he could purchase supplies for his $400 million White House ballroom.\n\nWhite House pool reports said the presidential motorcade “arrived at a shopping center in Lake Worth, Florida at 9:46 AM” so Trump could go “shopping at Arc Stone & Tile,” an importer of Italian marble.\n\nWhen pressed, a White House official said that the president “is purchasing lake and onyx, at his own expense, for the White House ballroom.”\n\nAlthough he may pay for the materials himself, conservative publication The New Republic pointed out that the president was shopping for his construction project “on the taxpayer’s dime.”\n\n“Trump has brought his longtime obsession with marble to his second term, pushing for it to appear just about everywhere,” TNR reported, noting that Trump “redid the bathroom in the White House Lincoln Suite entirely in marble, and he has proposed marble armrests for the Kennedy Center, claiming it would be ‘unlike anything ever done or seen before!'”\n\nTrump proudly shared photos of the Lincoln bathroom’s marble makeover replete with gold fixtures, writing on Truth Social in October that the “art deco green tile style” used in the 1940s “was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era.”\n\n“I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble,” Trump continued. “This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”\n\nTrump’s ballroom construction program came under fire immediately after he began tearing down the entire East Wing of the White House. The president initially said the ballroom would cost around $200 million, before revising it to $400 million. Trump has said the ballroom is completely privately funded.\n\nTrump has been staying at his private Florida club at Mar-a-Lago for New Year’s Eve celebrations. He also met there with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe post Trump’s Motorcade Reportedly Stops At a ‘Random’ FL Strip Mall So He Could Buy Marble For His Ballroom Project first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s habit of bragging about acing multiple cognitive tests may have accidentally confirmed everyone’s worst fears about the state of his health.\n\nAppearing on MS NOW, Dr. Vin Gupta discussed the president’s latest boast, the 79-year-old gloating yet again about scoring “100%” on a third cognitive examination in a Friday Truth Social post.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” the president wrote.\n\n“This is not the flex he thinks it is,” Gupta, medical analyst for NBC News and former chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy, said. “You don’t do this every other day and use that as evidence that you’re cognitively there.”\n\n“Those that tend to do Montreal [Cognitive Assessment Tool, or MOCA] tests with that level of frequency, usually we’re worried about the presence of early-stage dementia or cognitive impairment, so he might be ruling himself in to something that he doesn’t want to rule himself into.”\n\nThe president has faced increasing speculation surrounding his cognitive health during his second term, with multiple medical experts and Trump’s own niece suggesting that his decline is readily apparent.\n\nPsychologist Dr. John Gartner has previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that undertaking the same cognitive assessment multiple times suggests that his doctors are not assessing dementia, but monitoring it.\n\n“You could maybe justify giving someone the MoCA once, just on their age, just as part of a physical. If you’re giving it to him three times, that means you’re not assessing dementia. That means you’re monitoring dementia,” Gartner said.\n\nGartner has previously pointed to the president’s increasingly erratic behavior as evidence of his cognitive decline.\n\n“When people develop dementia, they become the worst versions of themselves,” he told the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles in November.\n\n“Whatever personality issues or problems [people with dementia] have begin to deteriorate and they become even more crude, disorganized, aggressive, confused versions of that personality disorder,” Gartner added.\n\nCaginess from the White House has only exacerbated speculation about the president’s health, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly declining to provide journalists or the American public with details of the president’s medical assessments.\n\nAfter the president himself blurted out in October that he had undergone an MRI during a physical examination, the White House initially declined to explain why. Eventually, in December, they claimed that it was a “preventative” measure due to his age—a claim medical experts immediately began to question.\n\n“There really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Dr. Jonathan Reiner told CNN in December. “This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging.”\n\nTrump has also regularly been seen with bruises on his hand—something the White House has blamed on frequent handshakes plus a daily aspirin regimen—and swollen ankles, likely the result of his chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis, both of which have added to concerns about his fitness for office, as has his seeming tendency to take naps during official meetings.\n\nIn January 2025, Trump—who regularly questioned his predecessor Joe Biden’s fitness for office—became the oldest president to take the oath of office.\n\nIn December, he posted a lengthy rant to Truth Social in which he argued that it was “seditious, perhaps even treasonous” to discuss his health.\n\n“After all of the work I have done with Medical Exams, Cognitive Exams, and everything else, I actually believe it’s seditious, perhaps even treasonous, for The New York Times, and others, to consistently do FAKE reports in order to libel and demean ‘THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,’” he wrote in response to a wave of fresh concern about his seemingly declining health.",

    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro reportedly made a statement on television and radio early Saturday as the U.S. strikes against his country unfolded, describing them as an \"attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela.\"\n\nThe remarks came before President Donald Trump announced that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country\" following a \"large scale strike\" carried out by the U.S. military. Attorney General Pam Bondi later said Maduro and Flores were indicted on charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\nIn comments aired on state television and radio, Maduro alleged that U.S. forces attacked civilian and military sites in Venezuela’s capital of Caracas, as well as the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira, according to The Miami Herald.\n\n\"This is an attack against the sovereignty of Venezuela,\" Maduro reportedly said as he stood alongside military and government officials. \"It is an attempt to impose a colonial war and force political change by violence.\"\n\nLive Updates: Trump Confirms Overnight Strikes In Venezuela, Says Us Has ‘Captured’ Maduro\n\nMaduro also described the U.S. actions as a \"grave military aggression\" and violation of the United Nations charter, adding that it threatened peace across Latin America and the Caribbean, The Miami Herald reported.\n\nThe U.S. has been carrying out a military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in recent months.\n\nMaria Corina Machado Emerges As Top Potential Successor After Maduro's Fall\n\nMaduro’s government cast the U.S. strikes on Saturday as part of a larger American effort to seize Venezuela’s oil and mineral reserves, according to The Miami Herald.\n\nThe newspaper reported that state TV broadcasted images of Venezuelan soldiers deploying to strategic infrastructure and officials holding emergency meetings.\n\nAs part of Maduro’s response, he also signed a decree that declared a nationwide state of \"external disturbance,\" which gives his government sweeping powers during emergencies, including mobilizing security forces and limiting certain civil liberties, The Miami Herald added.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Follow here for the latest developments on Saturday, January 3, 2026:\n\nVenezuela's Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello vowed on Saturday that Caracas \"will overcome\" the US military strikes.\n\nSpeaking to a local TV broadcast, Cabello said: \"This is not our first battle ... we have managed to survive under all circumstances.\"\n\nCabello is considered one of the most powerful men in Venezuela.\n\nOil production and refining at PDVSA, Venezuela's state-run energy company, were operating normally on Saturday despite the US strikes, Reuters news agency reported, citing two unnamed sources.\n\nPDVSA's most important facilities suffered no damage from the strikes, two sources with knowledge of the company's operations added.\n\nOne of the sources was cited by Reuters as saying the port of La Guaira suffered severe damage. The port is among the country's largest, near Caracas, but it is not used for oil operations.\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Ministry announced it was seeking a United Nations Security Council meeting to address the US strikes.\n\n\"Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the location of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was unknown, after US President Trump said they were captured and flown out of the country.\n\nThe European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas said the bloc called for restraint after the latest events in Venezuela.\n\n\"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,\" Kallas said in a post on X. \"Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected.\"\n\nThe vice president of the European Commission said she had spoken with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and that the bloc, like many other European countries, was \"closely monitoring\" the situation.\n\n\"The safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority,\" she said.\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei celebrated the news about the US having captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"Freedom advances,\" Milei, a staunch Trump supporter and ally, wrote in Spanish on X, reacting to a post announcing Maduro's capture. \"Long live freedom.\"\n\nGermany was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern, the German Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.\n\nThe ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team was scheduled to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nColombia is deploying military forces to the Venezuelan border, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said. The deployment comes after US strikes on the neighboring country.\n\nThe decision followed a National Security Council meeting held to discuss the US strikes.\n\nPetro condemned the strikes as an \"assault on the sovereignty\" of Latin America, warning of a humanitarian crisis. He said support forces will also be deployed to the border in the event of an influx of asylum seekers.\n\nSpain has offered to mediate for a \"peaceful solution\" in Venezuela in reaction to the US strikes.\n\nThe Spanish Foreign Ministry called in a statement for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in Venezuela.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared \"a new dawn for Venezuela\" after US strikes on the country and the capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\"The tyrant is gone. He will now—finally—face justice for his crimes,\" Landau said in a post on X.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that it was deeply worried over the US \"act of armed aggression\" against Venezuela.\n\n\"In the current ‌situation, ⁠it is important... to prevent further escalation ‍and to focus ​on ​finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,\" the Foreign Ministry said in a ‍statement.\n\n\"Ideological hostility has triumphed over businesslike pragmatism,\" said the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which has defended the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now nearing its fourth year.\n\nIn an audio address on state TV, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the location of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife was unknown. US President Trump said they were captured and flown out of the country.\n\n\"We demand proof of life,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nVenezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez said in a video on Saturday that the country will resist the presence of foreign troops, announcing a \"massive deployment\" of military resources.\n\nHe said some of the US strikes hit civilian areas, adding that Venezuela was compiling data about the victims.\n\nMedia reports cited unnamed US officials as saying Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was captured by US special forces troops.\n\nUnnamed US officials told CBS News that members of Delta Force, a US military top special mission unit, captured the Venezuelan president. This is the same force that killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of the so-called Islamic State, in 2019.\n\nUS President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday that the US had \"successfully\" carried out what he called a \"large-scale\" strike against Venezuela. In a social media post he added that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife were \"captured and flown out of the Country.\"\n\n\"This operation was done in conjunction with US Law Enforcement,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that a press conference on the strike will be held later on Saturday at Mar-a-Lago, Florida, at 4 p.m. UTC/GMT.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s bold claims that his policies delivered an unprecedented jobs boom for American-born workers are at odds with data showing a weaker market than under his predecessor.\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly boasted that all new job gains have gone to U.S.-born workers since he returned to office. “In the year before my election, all net creation of jobs was going to foreign migrants. Since I took office, 100 percent of all net job creation has gone to American-born citizens,” Trump said during an address to the nation last month. “One hundred percent.”\n\nAdministration officials have parroted that rhetoric, saying on X in November that what Trump “is doing for our workforce is nothing short of HISTORIC.”\n\n“While other Presidents allowed foreign workers to flood the job market, President Trump is working to ensure ALL jobs created go to our workers,” the U.S. Department of Labor’s X account posted.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump’s right-hand man, Vice President JD Vance, has been aggressively backing his government’s handling of the economy.\n\nJust last month, against the backdrop of pessimistic unemployment data, Vance graded Trump’s economic performance “A plus-plus-plus-plus.”\n\nHe has also praised the administration for “bringing jobs back to America.”\n\n“We had a policy in this country for 40 years of shipping American jobs overseas... There is going to be a massive exception to that 40-year trajectory of American decline, and that’s the second Trump admin,” he said in discussion with Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle in Washington, D.C.\n\nEconomists, however, are calling Trump’s bluff. Citing data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Washington Post reported Friday that the labor market itself has weakened, leaving U.S.-born workers modestly worse off than they had been under former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\n“The unemployment rate has been rising for both native-born and foreign-born adults,” Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Commerce Department economist, told the Post.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment among native-born workers was higher in late 2025 than a year earlier. The not seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for U.S.-born workers rose from 3.9 percent in November 2024 to 4.3 percent in November 2025.\n\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, Trump’s claims that his immigration policies are creating job market opportunities for U.S.-born workers are “false and based on a misreading of data from the household survey.”\n\n“If anything, the job market for U.S.-born workers is worse so far in 2025 than it was in preceding years,” senior economist Ben Zipperer wrote in September.\n\nIn August, Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and undersecretary for economic affairs at the US Department of Commerce under Biden, accused the president of committing a “multiple-count data felony” in trumpeting a jobs boom for native-born Americans.\n\nTaylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to the Post that “mindless nitpicking doesn’t change the simple fact that President Trump has done more for American workers than any president in history by cracking down on visa program abuses, successfully negotiating new trade deals, securing our border, and carrying out the largest mass deportation of illegal aliens.”\n\nRogers said those policies ensure “American-born workers can finally benefit from our new economic resurgence.”",

    "fullText": "2025 was supposed to be a big year for American manufacturing.\n\nIndeed, boosting US-made goods was a key priority of President Donald Trump's trade war, which led to wild swings in tariff rates on imported products.\n\nNearly a year later, the actual changes to consumer behavior aren't entirely clear.\n\nFor starters, many retailers worked quickly to order merchandise ahead of tariff deadlines and found alternate sources of comparable goods to secure lower duties.\n\nA particular challenge for brands that manufacture products in the US is that many still rely on imported materials or equipment, which have seen cost increases related to tariffs.\n\nOne entrepreneur who wanted to make a better grill scrubber discovered firsthand how hard — and expensive — it was to make a product entirely with an exclusively American supply chain.\n\nAnother gave shoppers the choice between otherwise identical shower heads: an imported version and an American-made one that cost nearly twice as much. No one bought the higher-priced product.\n\nOf course, neither industrial nor consumer behaviors change overnight.\n\nWith enough time and investment, some CEOs believe US manufacturing can make a comeback.\n\nAs things stand now, however, tariffs have largely settled at an average rate of around 15%, and consumers appear to be reluctantly accepting the higher prices. There's also the issue of unresolved legal challenges to much of Trump's authority to apply many of the tariffs that he did.\n\nSo, as a new year begins, will shoppers choose more American-made products, and will that be enough to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing?\n\nTake our survey to help us find out.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump, 79, fired off an early-morning tirade Friday insisting he is in “PERFECT HEALTH” as concerns grow over his apparent mental and physical decline.\n\n“The White House Doctors have just reported that I am in ‘PERFECT HEALTH,’ and that I ‘ACED’ (Meaning, was correct on 100% of the questions asked!), for the third straight time, my Cognitive Examination, something which no other President, or previous Vice President, was willing to take,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n“P.S., I strongly believe that anyone running for President, or Vice President, should be mandatorily forced to take a strong, meaningful, and proven Cognitive Examination. Our great Country cannot be run by ‘STUPID’ or INCOMPETENT PEOPLE!”\n\nTrump has routinely brushed aside suggestions he is in mental decline by boasting about passing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test used to detect cognitive impairment or early signs of dementia. The test involves tasks such as drawing a clock to show a specific time and identifying animals.\n\nDuring a December 2025 speech in North Carolina, Trump also proudly told the crowd how he “aced” such a test.\n\n“The first question is like, ‘What is this?’ And they show a lion, a giraffe, a fish, and a hippopotamus. And they say, ‘Which is the giraffe?’” Trump said.\n\n“I don’t think Joe [Biden] would have gotten the first question right,” he added. “He would say hippo. ‘I want the hippo,’”\n\nThe Daily Beast has been leading the way in reporting on concerns about the president’s health, including frequently documenting how Trump covers large bruises on his hands with makeup and tries to conceal his swollen cankles whenever possible.\n\nIn a remarkably candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published Jan. 1, Trump—the oldest sitting president in U.S. history—was forced to address his health issues and, in doing so, he contradicted previous assurances given to the public.\n\nHe revealed that his second medical exam last year at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center involved a CT scan, not an MRI as previously disclosed. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, Trump’s physician who conducted the exam, told the Journal that the CT scan was performed to “definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues.”\n\nThe White House confirmed in July 2025 that Trump had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition that causes swelling in the lower legs.\n\nTrump told the Journal that he briefly wore compression socks to help with his cankles but stopped because he did not like them. The president also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.”\n\n“They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” Trump said. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?”\n\nTrump blamed the frequent bruising on his hands—which he desperately attempts to conceal with concealer—on his heavy daily aspirin use.\n\nFor months, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has offered a boilerplate response when the Daily Beast asked about the bruises, insisting they are the result of the president “meeting more Americans and shaking their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nTrump also admitted he is so fragile that his hand bled after Attorney General Pam Bondi nicked him with her ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July 2024.\n\n“The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut,” Trump told the Journal of the incident, which reportedly caused alarm among members of his inner circle.\n\nTrump said he applies makeup to his hands whenever he gets “whacked again.”\n\n“I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on. Takes about 10 seconds,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.\n\nThe White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.\n\nBeijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders’ strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance” in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would “further deepen the friendly relations” between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.\n\nTakaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.\n\nThe two exchanged views “mainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.\n\nChina's military drills off Taiwan also came after the Trump administration announced a package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion. If approved by Congress, it would represent the largest such aid to the island ever — a move criticized sharply by China.\n\nBeijing claims sovereignty over the self-governed island and vows to seize it — by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient hardware to deter any attack from the mainland.\n\nTrump on Monday said he was not informed of the exercises in advance but still touted his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTrump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October, shortly after she took office. The two exchanged warm words, and Trump took her with him when he spoke to U.S. troops aboard an aircraft carrier in Japan.\n\nAfter Takaichi's Taiwan comments angered Beijing, Trump called her and said they were “extremely good friends” and that she should call him any time, according to the Japanese leader, without disclosing if the two talked about her remarks.",

    "fullText": "The S&P 500 advanced 16% in 2025, notching double-digit gains for the third straight year.\n\nFederal Reserve research suggests President Trump's tariffs will slow economic growth.\n\nThe S&P 500 trades at the most expensive valuation since the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) added 16% in 2025, marking the third consecutive year in which the benchmark index has recorded double-digit gains. Unfortunately, investors have reason to think 2026 will more challenging. Evidence suggests President Trump's tariffs are hurting the economy, and the stock market just flashed a warning last seen during the dot-com crash in 2000.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nIn 2025, President Donald Trump broke with decades of trade-policy precedent and imposed sweeping tariffs that raised the average tax on U.S. imports to 16.8%, the highest level since 1935, per the Budget Lab at Yale. And Trump -- who once called tariffs \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary -- has made many misleading or inaccurate statements to drum up support for his signature trade policies.\n\nTrump said foreign exporters would absorb the tariffs for the \"privilege of access\" to the American market. However, Goldman Sachs says U.S. companies and consumers collectively paid 82% of the tariffs in October 2025, and 67% of the burden will fall on consumers alone by July 2026.\n\nTrump said tariffs would bring manufacturing work back to America. However, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) says U.S. manufacturing activity has now contracted in nine consecutive months due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs.\n\nTrump said tariffs would protect American workers and create millions of jobs. However, unemployment is at a four-year high and (excluding the pandemic) hiring slowed more profoundly in 2025 than any other year since the Great Recession in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nTrump said tariffs would make America wealthy again and people would be \"very happy\" with the result. However, consumer sentiment in 2025 recorded its lowest annual average since the University of Michigan started collecting data in 1960.\n\nImportantly, U.S. GDP increased an annual 4.3% during the third quarter, the most robust growth in two years. President Trump credited tariffs for the booming economy. However, GDP growth was artificially high because imports (which are subtracted from GDP) were artificially low. Why were imports low? Companies stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs earlier this year.",

    "fullText": "After President Donald Trump expanded the travel ban he put in place during his first term in the White House to 20 more countries and the Palestinian Authority last December, at least three other nations responded in turn with visa bans for Americans.\n\nOn Dec. 26, the West African nation of Niger announced that it was \"completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States.\"\n\nAfter it was included in the list of countries whose citizens are completely banned from entering the U.S. last June, the government of Chad similarly announced that it was acting upon \"principles of reciprocity and suspend[ing] the granting of visas to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nAs of January 2026, 39 countries now face either a full travel ban or restrictions on various types of visas for entering the United States.\n\nThe latest country to respond is the West African nation of Burkina Faso. A landlocked nation sharing borders with six other countries, Burkina Faso announced that it had put in place \"equivalent visa measures to citizens of the United States of America.\"\n\nWhile this currently means a full ban on visas necessary to enter the country, Burkina Faso said it \"remains committed to mutual respect, the sovereign equality of States, and the principle of reciprocity in its international relations.\"\n\nDue to a decades-old history of war coupled with political violence, Western travel into Burkina Faso remains very low; the U.S. State Department currently keeps it at a level four \"do not travel\" advisory over \"organizations [that] continue to plan and conduct terrorist activities.\"\n\nThe latter, along with a high visa overstay rate, were named by the Trump administration as the primary justification for being placed on the travel ban.\n\nSharing a southwestern border with Burkina Faso, Mali has also put in place a reciprocal ban on American travel.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation released a statement saying that any U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nMajor airline launches surprising flight between Las Vegas and Paris\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nThe highest rooftop in Barcelona is in a surprising place\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has publicly humiliated his spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt by contradicting her repeated reassurances and excuses about his health woes.\n\nSince Trump, 79, returned to office last January, speculation has raged over bruising on his hands and about his cognitive ability, particularly after he underwent a mystery scan in the fall—with the Daily Beast leading the way on reporting the president’s various medical issues, including his swollen cankles.\n\nLeavitt, 28, has repeatedly claimed the reason for the discoloration on the back of his right hand—which the president has covered up with band-aids, bandages, and thick make-up—is that as “a man of the people,” Trump “meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other president in history.”\n\nWhile Leavitt has also attributed the bruising to the president’s routine aspirin use, she has often led her responses to questions about Trump’s hands by blaming his handshaking, including when questioned on the matter earlier this month by the Beast’s political correspondent Farrah Tomazin.\n\n“The president is literally constantly shaking hands, the Oval Office is like Grand Central Terminal,” she explained earlier this month.\n\nDays after the bruising appeared to spread to Trump’s left hand—which he does not use to greet people—the president on Thursday gave a revelatory interview about his health to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTrump offered a different reason for the bruising: overuse of aspirin and his thinning skin.\n\nHe told the Journal that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin a day—four times the 81-milligram “low dose” commonly used in daily therapy, per the Mayo Clinic—despite conceding his doctors have urged him to take less.\n\nThis higher-than-recommended aspirin use, Trump said, has become a central factor in the bruising that’s been spotted on his hands. But he told the outlet he refuses to reduce the dose because he’s been on the same routine for decades, and is “a little superstitious.”\n\nTrump also said he wears makeup because he has soft skin, and it bruises when it gets “whacked.”\n\nDiscussing an episode in which Attorney General Pam Bondi, 60, nicked him during a high-five, he told the Journal: “The ring hit the back of my hand, and, yes, there was a slight little cut.”\n\nHe added that he puts makeup on his hands after he gets “whacked again by someone,” saying: “I have makeup that’s, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds.”\n\nTrump also gave more details about his October scan, further embarrassing Leavitt, who has fended off repeated inquiries about it from the White House podium.\n\nShe at first repeatedly answered questions without naming the test and leaning on scripted assurances about his condition. On October 23, she declined to specify what test he received. On November 4, pressed on why Trump had a week earlier described it as an MRI, she said she would “check back,” while insisting he was in “optimal physical health” and framing the Walter Reed visit as a routine follow-up.\n\nWhen asked again on November 12, Leavitt leaned on the language of the doctor’s memo, reiterating that Trump received “advanced imaging” as part of a routine exam and that physicians considered him in “exceptional” condition, without explaining why the imaging was ordered.\n\nLeavitt’s position remained the same until December 1, when Trump’s physician, Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, released a memo describing cardiovascular imaging. Leavitt told reporters the screening was normal and positioned the disclosure as transparency.\n\nEven then, the White House’s preferred shorthand remained “advanced imaging,” rather than a clear, consistent label for what Trump had undergone.\n\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he’d been telling people it was an MRI, but then corrected it: “It wasn’t an MRI… It was less than that. It was a scan.” He complained that getting the test had handed critics “ammunition” because it fueled questions about whether something was wrong.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump and Barbabella ultimately characterized the procedure as a CT scan performed to rule out cardiovascular issues, with no abnormalities found.\n\nLeavitt is quoted in the Journal saying the White House had “often referred to the procedure as ‘advanced imaging,’” while not addressing why Trump didn’t correct the MRI/CT description sooner.\n\nIn the Journal article, Trump also discussed his ‘cankles’ and why he apparently cannot stay awake during public meetings.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Leavitt for comment.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump may now be having trouble walking across flat surfaces.\n\nThe president appeared to be hiding a slight limp as he was filmed walking with his wife, Melania, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe new speculation over the 79-year-old’s health came after he revealed in an interview that he tried compression socks for his swollen ankles and used makeup to cover the bruising on his hands caused by large daily doses of aspirin.\n\nThe popular anti-Trump X account Call to Activism posted a clip of Trump appearing to drag his right leg as he walked down a runway toward the press gathered to snap attendees of his ritzy New Year’s Eve party.\n\nThe account, which has over 1.1 million followers, wrote, ″Trump just showed up at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate New Year’s, dragging his right leg, and quickly adjusted his walk when he realizes the cameras are on. What’s Trump hiding?\"\n\nIn the clip, Trump can be seen slightly limping as he enters the frame, but after a few steps, he adopts a steadier gait before he and First Lady Melania Trump stop to pose for photographs.\n\nViewers were split on whether the clip showed a new medical malady for the oldest president in American history or if it was no big deal.\n\n“It pretty obvious [sic] he is dragging his right leg. If Biden had done that every news station would have this video up all day all time about his health,” wrote one suspicious viewer on X.\n\n“Honestly? Probably nothing,” said a less-convinced X user. “He knows the cameras are always watching, so of course he adjusted. Not every awkward step means there’s something being hidden.”\n\nOn Monday, the nearly octogenarian president had difficulty descending four small steps at Mar-a-Lago. On multiple occasions, he has descended the steps on Air Force One at a snail’s pace.\n\nHe has also been filmed struggling to walk in straight lines and dragging his right leg in public for years.\n\nWednesday’s Mar-a-Lago entrance comes amidst intensified speculation about Trump’s health issues, which the Daily Beast has led the charge in covering.\n\nThese include persistent bruising on his hands, difficulty sleeping through the night and staying awake during the day, and chronic venous insufficiency, which has caused his ankles to swell.\n\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump personally called the publication to complain about the persistent coverage of his health and attempted to set the record straight on some health mysteries that have dogged his second term.\n\nTrump told the publication that he takes quadruple the common dose of aspirin for “cardiac prevention,” and that is what causes the bruising on his hands.\n\nThe piece did not address speculation about Trump’s ambling gait. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the president’s Mar-a-Lago entrance.\n\nWhen the Daily Beast reported on Trump taking a circuitous route between Marine One and Air Force One in September, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the publication, “You must be f-----g blind or stupid, because that was a perfect walk.”",

    "description": "I'm keeping track of Trump's economy right here. Every month. Enjoy!",
    "fullText": "(AKA the unemployment rate, cost of eggs, gas prices, inflation, the Dow Jones, whether citizens received a stimulus check, and Trump's overall approval rating.)\n\nIt wasn't exactly convincing, considering Americans are facing massive insurance hikes in 2026 because Trump and his party recently chose to allow Affordable Care Act subsidies to expire in two weeks. Likewise, our pockets are shrinking as the cost of food and living bloat.\n\nNote: Data on inflation is released a few weeks after each month has ended, so our reports will look at the previous month's numbers.\n\nGetting data on the unemployment rate between September and November has been plagued and vague due to the government shutdown this year. September's numbers were late. October's rate was altogether canceled, and November appears to have come in at 4.6% according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFor someone who brags about a booming economy, the steady increase in Americans searching for work sure doesn't bode well for the president's claims.\n\nAh, the price of eggs. Another cursed number.\n\nFood indexes are also released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and so we won't be getting an October number. I can, however, report that eggs officially dropped under the $3 mark, and you can find a grade A dozen for around $2.86 on average in November.\n\nShifting from a positive to a negative, the cost of beef is still skyrocketing, and I continue to find that giving up red meat this year was one of the best financial decisions I've made.\n\nIf you're looking for a pound of beef, prices jumped to $6.50 on average in November.\n\n(And yes, the government shutdown is still acting as the Ghost of Christmas past, and we will not be getting an October average here either.)\n\nGas is going down, though! I'm sure y'all will flood the comment section with local prices wayyyyy higher than the national average, and wish you saw numbers as low as this, but according to the Energy Information Administration, a gallon of gasoline cost around $3.179 last month.\n\nInflation dropped to its lowest point in months, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2.7% figure has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \"For the inflation report, many economists were caught off guard by the way the B.L.S. handled the distortions, which is part of why they are casting so much doubt on the numbers published today.\"\n\nThe above is fancy speak to say that the government shutdown caused \"distortions\" in the data surrounding inflation, and so it may or may not paint a prettier picture than reality.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones neither rose nor fell in November, according to Stat Muse. So, there's that.\n\nWe're approaching a full year under Trump's second presidency, and there's still no stimulus check in sight for struggling Americans. What happened to those $2,000 tariff dividend checks Trump promised on Truth Social? I haven't heard a single word of it since Nov. 9.\n\nYIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES. YIKES.

YIKES.\n\nTrump's approval rating hit an all-time low for this term. Gallup reports that only 36% of Americans approve of how Trump's second presidency is going. It's looking BLEAK.\n\nIt's not uncommon for me to see comments from conservatives who claim the data presented in this report is \"fake news.\" Usually, I point to the fact that the data is retrieved from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the US Energy Administration, which fall under Trump's own administration. So, if the numbers are \"fake news,\" that would mean these MAGA commenters believe Trump's people are spreading fake news...\n\nI appreciate the readership, regardless. <3\n\nAlso in In the News: 27 Photos Of Donald Trump In 2025 He Probably Reaaaaaally Doesn't Want You To See\n\nAlso in In the News: \"Oh My God\": People Are Not Holding Back AT ALL After Trump Made Another White House \"Upgrade,\" And Hoo Boy, You Gotta See This One\n\nAlso in In the News: Donald Trump Hated His Time Magazine Cover...

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is facing a new legal complaint from a group of government employees who are affected by a new policy going into effect Thursday that eliminates coverage for gender-affirming care in federal health insurance programs.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.\n\nThe complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.\n\n“This policy is not about cost or care — it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the State Department, Health and Human Services and the Postal Service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.\n\nFor instance, the Postal Service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.\n\nThe complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees.”\n\nThe Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.\n\nSenior Trump officials, such as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "The student loan system feels increasingly unstable and that uncertainty is driving more people to look for relief.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is taking a harder line on Americans with student loan debt, and borrowers are feeling it from two sides.\n\nOn the one front, the U.S. Department of Education has slammed the brakes on income-driven repayment (1). In August alone, 327,955 applications were denied, according to a Dec. 15 court filing (2). For borrowers who were counting on those plans to cap their monthly bills and eventually erase remaining balances, the fallout is immediate: higher payments or a limbo-like forbearance where interest keeps piling up while relief stays out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the government is preparing to restart wage garnishment for borrowers in default as early as January (3). Millions of people are already more than 270 days behind on their loans, putting them at risk of having part of their paycheck seized after a 30-day notice.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nOnline, frustration is boiling over. One Reddit user wrote (4), “Mine will be nearly $500 a month which is literally impossible for me to pay. I just laugh at it now because simply no way I can afford that. If I tried, my parents and I would be dead before I pay even a quarter of what I owe. It’s a joke.”\n\nAmid the tightening screws, however, a surprising escape hatch is opening. Student loans have long been considered nearly impossible to wipe out through bankruptcy — but that assumption might be outdated.\n\nBorrowers who pursue bankruptcy relief are succeeding at rates few would have believed just a decade ago. An analysis by University of Utah law professor Jason Iuliano (5) found filers now manage to discharge some or all of their student debt 87% of the time through bankruptcy, up from 61% in 2017, largely due to a streamlined legal process introduced three years ago.\n\n“That’s strikingly high when you think about the narrative being it’s impossible to discharge,” Iuliano told The New York Times (6). His findings were published this month in The American Bankruptcy Law Journal, following 15 years of research.\n\nThe shift comes as financial pressure on borrowers continues to grow. A survey from the Institute for College Access and Success found 42% of borrowers are forced to choose between student loan payments and basic necessities, while 20% are delinquent or already in default (7). Even though the Biden administration canceled $183.6 billion in loans for more than 5 million borrowers, broader forgiveness efforts have stalled (8).",

    "description": "Student-loan borrowers will begin to see the effects of Trump's changes to repayment and borrowing in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "The new year is bringing a host of new changes for millions of student-loan borrowers.\n\nBeginning in July 2026, the student-loan provisions signed into law in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation are set to begin taking effect. Those provisions include rolling out new student-loan repayment plans, new borrowing caps, and eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans, which could result in higher monthly payments for borrowers.\n\nHere's what the Trump administration has in store for student-loan repayment in 2026.\n\nBeginning in July, the Department of Education plans to begin its process of eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan.\n\nThe standard repayment plan would set fixed payments for borrowers over a 10 to 25-year period based on the borrower's original balance. The Repayment Assistance Plan would serve as the income-based option for borrowers; it would set payments at 1% to 10% of the borrower's income, with a minimum monthly payment of $10 and forgiveness after 30 years.\n\nIt's less generous than the existing income-based repayment plan, which forgives balances after 20 or 25 years, and former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which would forgive balances after as few as 10 years of payments.\n\nBorrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2026, will have until 2028 to enroll in RAP before the other plans phase out. Borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, will only have RAP and the standard repayment plan as available repayment options.\n\nIn addition to new repayment plans, Trump's spending legislation eliminated the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nIt also implemented new borrowing caps for borrowers seeking advanced degrees. Graduate students would have a cap of $20,500 a year or $100,000 over a lifetime, and professional students would have a cap of $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime.\n\nThe Department of Education also proposed instituting a revised definition of a \"professional\" program, which included 10 programs that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap, including medicine, law, and dentistry. The new definition was a key point of contention with stakeholders who negotiated the terms with the department because the revised definition leaves out advanced programs like nursing, some of which have tuition that is above the proposed caps.\n\nTrump's spending legislation included eliminating the SAVE plan as part of its phase-out of existing income-driven repayment plans by 2028. However, his administration announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri in December that would end the SAVE plan as soon as the court approves the settlement.\n\nIt means that the 7 million borrowers enrolled in SAVE would have a limited period of time to find a new repayment plan and restart their monthly payments at a higher amount. Additionally, the department said that it would deny pending applications to SAVE, which would include 450,000 borrowers who have expressed interest in enrolling in the plan.\n\nThe Department of Education is expanding eligibility for income-based repayment plans by removing the requirement of partial financial hardship. Prior to Trump's spending legislation, borrowers seeking to enroll in an IBR plan were required to have a monthly payment based on their income that was less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over 10 years.\n\nRemoving that requirement, which the department said would be completed in December 2025, means that borrowers with higher incomes would be eligible to enroll in IBR. Additionally, the department said that servicers would hold IBR applications that would otherwise be denied, and the applications would be processed once the updates to IBR were completed.",

    "fullText": "Trump Media & Technology Group shareholders may be receiving a late Christmas gift shortly after the 2025 holiday season, though the exact date isn't clear.\n\nThe Truth Social parent has announced plans to issue a new crypto to its investor base. In a company statement released on Wednesday, December 31, the company revealed that it will distribute the token in partnership with Crypto.com and that it will operate on the Cronos blockchain.\n\nWhile the statement noted that Trump Media expects each DJT shareholder to receive one token for every share they hold, no specific timing has been provided yet. The company also said that those who receive these tokens may also be given rewards in the coming year, which may include discounts on company products.\n\nThis decision comes at a time when digital assets with ties to the Trump name have struggled significantly and are facing increasing scrutiny from both finance pros and investors. The Trump family lost roughly $1 billion in the recent crypto market meltdown, primarily due to bitcoin's steep decline and the $Trump meme coin falling sharply. American Bitcoin Corp, a company in which Eric Trump is a primary shareholder, has struggled significantly since its September IPO, falling 14% year-to-date.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to struggle, this new crypto offering, intended to reward Trump Media shareholders after a difficult year, may raise some questions. Haonan Li, founder of stablecoin merchant platform Codex, noted that it is entering the market at a less-than-ideal time.\n\n\"Projects like this are entering a much more skeptical market,\" he told Business Insider. \"Investors already have many ways to get crypto exposure, and spreading a strategy across multiple Trump-linked vehicles risks diluting demand rather than concentrating it.\"\n\n$Trump coin's recent performance may also raise concern, as it could be viewed as an indication of instability for the new crypto. The meme coin has fallen 14% over the past month. Meanwhile, the $MELANIA Trump meme coin plunged shortly after its launch in January 2025 and is down 94% for the year.\n\nLi also noted that the world of crypto is ever-changing and with it, the rules that drive the volatile market. In his view, the last crypto cycle was dominated by narratives, as real economic activity was constrained by regulation. But the market has shifted since then and the outlook is starkly different.\n\n\"The lines are blurring, but investors are far more discerning than last cycle, and simply copying what worked before will not be enough,\" he added.\n\nTrump's pro-crypto policies helped boost markets earlier in 2025 as investors viewed it as lending stability to the notoriously volatile asset class, cheering the easing of regulatory roadblocks. But with the year ending on a low note, it is unclear how a crypto created to reward shareholders in a struggling stock will be received.",

    "fullText": "FILE – President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin during a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Aug. 15, 2025. \n\nOn Tuesday, Russian broadcaster and propagandist Vladimir Solovyov said on his show that Russian President Vladimir Putin “achieved a knockout victory” prior to the latest meeting between U.S. and Ukrainian leadership, claiming that a phone call that took place between President Donald Trump and Putin “completely destroyed [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky’s plans.”\n\nTrump met with Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, where he said they were “very close” to a peace deal in the four-year Russia-Ukraine war, adding that there are still “1-2 thorny issues,” one of which is land that remains ”up for grabs.”\n\nZelensky agreed, saying the two leaders agreed on 90% of his 20-point peace plan.\n\nOn Tuesday night’s episode of Evening with Vladimir Solovyov, the Kremlin promoter said, “We have achieved a knockout victory. We prepared on a grandmaster’s level on all the main points, and it worked.”\n\n“Everything was extremely precise, and of course, Zelensky started to melt,” Solovyov added. “He melted down… The mood just wasn’t there.”\n\nAs Trump mentioned on Sunday, he and Putin were on the phone for more than two hours shortly before Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago. He told reporters, “Russia wants it ended, everybody wants it ended,” and that the Russian president “wants to see” a peace deal finalized soon.\n\nTrump also added that he planned to call Putin again after Zelensky’s departure.\n\nAccording to Solovyov’s Tuesday commentary, the phone call between Moscow and Palm Beach “completely destroyed Zelensky’s plans.” He went as far as to insinuate that there was no point in the Ukrainian president even getting off the plane.\n\nJust last Saturday, in a move that directly counters Putin’s alleged willingness to move towards peace, Russia hammered Ukraine’s capital city with missiles and attack drones, injuring at least 11 people and leaving almost a third of Kyiv without heat.\n\nThe post ‘Knockout Victory’: Russian Broadcaster Says Trump-Putin Call ‘Completely Destroyed Zelensky’s Plans’ Before Meeting first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "14 Unflattering Things Trumps’ Staff Have Revealed About Him",
    "description": "Trump's staff has shared these secret (and really unflattering) things about him.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s public persona is loud, forceful, and relentlessly self-assured. But behind closed doors, former aides, advisors, and staffers—many of whom were loyal until they weren’t—have painted a far less flattering picture. Through interviews, books, testimony, and off-the-record accounts, a pattern emerges that’s less about ideology and more about temperament, impulse, and management style. What follows isn’t rumor or partisan caricature. It’s what people who worked closest to him say they witnessed firsthand.\n\nMultiple former staffers have described how Trump would disengage from intelligence briefings if the information contradicted his instincts or preferred narrative. Reports indicate he often skimmed written materials, asked for his name to be highlighted, or redirected conversations toward topics that interested him more. Complex or nuanced information frustrated him, particularly if it required patience or follow-up.\n\nWhat disturbed aides wasn’t disagreement—it was disinterest. Decisions were sometimes made without fully absorbing the underlying facts. For a president, that pattern alarmed staff who understood the stakes. The issue wasn’t skepticism; it was selective attention.\n\nFormer aides have said Trump fostered competition and confusion by giving conflicting instructions to different people. Rather than clarifying chains of command, he often encouraged rivalries and rewarded whoever delivered results—or praise—fastest. This created an environment where loyalty mattered more than coordination.\n\nStaffers described a culture of anxiety, where information was hoarded and alliances shifted constantly. The lack of internal trust made consistent policy execution difficult. Chaos wasn’t a side effect—it was baked into how the workplace functioned.\n\nAccounts from former staff consistently point to Trump’s fixation on optics. He reportedly monitored television coverage obsessively, tracked crowd sizes, and demanded immediate rebuttals to perceived slights. Staff were often tasked with managing not policy outcomes, but emotional reactions to media narratives.\n\nThis preoccupation shaped priorities. Decisions were sometimes evaluated based on how they would “look” rather than how they would function. For aides trying to manage governance, image frequently overrode substance.\n\nFormer staffers have said Trump struggled to separate criticism of his actions from attacks on his identity. Pushback—even internal—was often interpreted as betrayal. This made honest counsel risky, especially when delivering bad news.\n\nAs a result, aides learned to soften language or avoid raising concerns altogether. The feedback loop narrowed over time. Staff who challenged him tended not to last, reinforcing an echo chamber around his preferences.\n\nSeveral former officials have described Trump as highly impressionable in the moment. A persuasive conversation, cable news segment, or trusted voice could dramatically shift his stance—sometimes within hours. Consistency was difficult to maintain.\n\nThis volatility frustrated staff tasked with implementing decisions that might reverse without warning. Policy became fluid not because of new evidence, but because of new influence. For insiders, it created constant instability.\n\nStaff accounts suggest Trump oscillated between detachment and intrusion. He often avoided detailed oversight, then suddenly intervened in minor decisions that caught his attention. This unpredictability made planning difficult.\n\nAides were left guessing which issues would trigger involvement. Large-scale strategy might receive little input, while trivial details drew intense focus. The imbalance weakened organizational coherence.\n\nMany former staffers have said Trump prized personal loyalty above expertise. Advisors who defended him publicly or flattered him privately were often elevated, even if they lacked relevant experience. Conversely, qualified staff who contradicted him were sidelined.\n\nThis dynamic shaped hiring, retention, and internal culture. Competence mattered less than allegiance. Over time, this narrowed the pool of voices willing—or able—to operate effectively within his orbit.\n\nFormer aides have said Trump preferred clear winners and losers, simple explanations, and immediate outcomes. Issues that required nuance, patience, or long-term tradeoffs often lost his attention quickly. Staff learned that presenting layered analysis could backfire if it felt too abstract or unresolved.\n\nThis made governing in a complex global system especially difficult. Problems that didn’t lend themselves to simple framing were either delayed or oversimplified. The discomfort with ambiguity pushed decision-making toward blunt solutions, even when the situation demanded precision.\n\nNumerous staffers have described the shock of being contradicted, corrected, or criticized by Trump in public settings, including press conferences and on social media. Statements made internally would be reversed without warning. Loyalty did not guarantee protection from public rebuke.\n\nThis behavior eroded internal trust and credibility. Aides struggled to represent administration positions confidently, knowing they could be disavowed at any moment. The unpredictability weakened both morale and authority.\n\nStaff accounts often describe Trump approaching the presidency as an extension of branding rather than administration. Rallies, television appearances, and crowd response carried disproportionate weight in shaping his priorities. Governing tasks that lacked spectacle received less enthusiasm.\n\nThis blurred the line between leadership and entertainment. Policy became secondary to audience reaction. For aides focused on outcomes rather than optics, the imbalance was a constant source of friction.\n\nFormer insiders have noted that Trump reacted defensively to information that portrayed him as uninformed, wrong, or at fault. Briefings that contradicted his self-perception were often dismissed or reframed. Admitting error was seen as a weakness rather than a course correction.\n\nThis limited adaptive learning. Mistakes were harder to acknowledge, and strategies harder to revise. Staff learned that protecting ego was often necessary to keep conversations moving forward at all.\n\nMany aides have described the pace of work as relentless and reactive. Emergencies were frequent, often driven by Trump’s own statements or actions. Staff spent enormous energy responding to self-created crises rather than advancing long-term goals.\n\nThe environment left little room for stability or reflection. Burnout was common, turnover high. For many insiders, survival replaced strategy as the primary focus.\n\nFormer staffers have said Trump was quick to claim credit for perceived successes but distanced himself from failures. Blame was often redirected toward aides, opponents, or external forces. Accountability flowed downward, not upward.\n\nThis shaped internal dynamics sharply. Staff learned that proximity to power carried risk as well as prestige. Mistakes—real or perceived—could end careers abruptly.\n\nPerhaps the most consistent thread across post-White House interviews is emotional exhaustion. Even aides who supported Trump’s goals described feeling worn down by volatility, unpredictability, and constant tension. The job demanded not just labor, but emotional regulation.\n\nFor many, leaving wasn’t ideological—it was psychological. The cumulative effect of chaos, loyalty tests, and public exposure took a lasting toll. What staff revealed afterward wasn’t bitterness so much as relief.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is not the first president to want more room at the White House for entertaining, says the longest-serving top aide in the executive residence, offering some backup for the reason Trump has cited for his ballroom construction project.\n\nGary Walters spent more than two decades as White House chief usher to presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush — a role that is akin to being the general manager of the residence.\n\n“All the presidents that I had an opportunity to serve always talked about some possibility of an enlarged area” for entertaining, Walters said in an interview with The Associated Press about his recently published memoir.\n\nTrump has been talking about building a White House ballroom for years, even before he entered the political arena. In July, the White House announced a 90,000-square-foot space would be built on the east side of the complex to accommodate 650 seated guests at a then-estimated cost of $200 million. Trump has said it will be paid for with private donations, including from him.\n\nThe Republican president later upped the proposed ballroom’s capacity to 999 people and, by October, had demolished the two-story East Wing of the White House to build it there. In December, he updated the price tag to $400 million — double the original estimate.\n\n“So there's always been construction going on around the White House,” Walters said.\n\nOther presidents bemoaned the lack of space for entertaining\n\nWhen Walters was on the job, the capacity of the largest public rooms in the White House was among the first topics he discussed with the incoming president, first lady and their social secretary, he said. The presidents he served all talked about the limited number of people the White House could handle.\n\nWhen set up for a state dinner, the State Dining Room can hold about 130 people: 13 round tables each with seating for 10, Walters said. The East Room can accommodate about 300 chairs — fewer if space is needed for television cameras.\n\nTrump complains often that both rooms are too small. He also has complained about the use of large tents on the south grounds, the main workaround for big events such as ritzy state dinners for foreign leaders. Walters said the tents had issues.\n\n“When it rained, the water flows downhill and the grass became soggy, no matter what we tried to do,” Walters said. “We dug culverts around the outside of the tent to try and get the water.\" Tents damaged the grass, requiring more work to reseed it, he said.\n\nWalters admitted it was a bit jarring to see the East Wing torn down, and said he had fond personal memories of the space. “I met my wife at the White House and she worked in the East Wing, so that was a joy for me,” said Walters, 79.\n\nHis wife, Barbara, was a receptionist in the visitors office during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. The couple recently celebrated 48 years of marriage.\n\nBroken bones alter usher's career trajectory\n\nWalters owes his place in history as the longest-serving White House chief usher to the misfortune of a broken ankle.\n\nHe was 23 in early 1970, honorably discharged from the Army and looking for a job that would allow him to finish college at night. The Executive Protective Service, a precursor to the U.S. Secret Service, was hiring and accepted him.\n\nBut shortly before the graduation ceremony, Walters broke an ankle playing football. He could not patrol out of uniform, wearing a cast and hobbling around on crutches, so he was given a temporary assignment in the White House Police Control and Appointments Center. He stayed for five years.\n\n“This injury also changed the course of my career,” Walters wrote in his memoir, “White House Memories: 1970-2007: Recollections of the Longest-Serving Chief Usher.” He gained an ”in-depth knowledge of the ways and security systems of the White House that would ultimately greatly benefit me in my future role in the Usher's Office.\"\n\nA few months after being promoted to sergeant in 1975, he learned of an opening in the Usher's Office. He applied and joined as an assistant in early 1976.\n\nA decade later, he was elevated to chief usher by Reagan, who gave Walters the top job in the residence overseeing maintenance, construction and renovation projects, and food service, along with administrative, financial and personnel functions. He managed a staff of about 90 butlers, housekeepers, cooks, florists, electricians, engineers, plumbers and others.\n\nWalters retired in 2007 after 37 years at the White House, including a record 21 years as chief usher. He served under seven presidents, from Nixon to George W. Bush.\n\nIn that time, Walters saw a broad swath of presidential history: the only president who ever resigned, an appointed vice president become the only unelected president, a president be impeached and stay in office, a father and son become president and the Supreme Court decide the most closely contested presidential election in U.S. history.\n\nHe's often asked what he liked most about his work and “without hesitation I say it is getting to know and interact directly with the president, first lady, and other members of their family. It was an honor to get to know them with my own eyes and ears,” Walters wrote.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump excoriated Colorado Governor Jared Polis and a Republican district attorney from the Centennial State on Wednesday, even going so far as to instruct them to “rot in hell.”\n\n“God Bless Tina Peters, who is now, for two years out of nine, sitting in a Colorado Maximum Security Prison, at the age of 73, and sick, for the ‘crime’ of trying to stop the massive voter fraud that goes on in her State ( where people are leaving in record numbers!),” began Trump in a post on Truth Social. “Hard to wish her a Happy New Year, but to the Scumbag Governor, and the disgusting ‘Republican’ (RINO!) DA, who did this to her (nothing happens to the Dems and their phony Mail In Ballot System that makes it impossible for a Republican to win an otherwise very winnable State!), I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell. FREE TINA PETTERS!”\n\nPeters, the former clerk for Colorado’s Mesa County, is serving nine years in prison for seven state-level charges pertaining to election interference back in 2020. Using her public capacity, Peters gave an associate of MyPillow CEO and Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Mike Lindell access to Mesa County election software. The counts against her include three of “attempting to influence a public servant” and one of criminal impersonation.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump claimed to have pardoned Peters in another Truth Social post that read:\n\nFor years, Democrats ignored Violent and Vicious Crime of all shapes, sizes, colors, and types. Violent Criminals who should have been locked up were allowed to attack again. Democrats were also far too happy to let in the worst from the worst countries so they could rip off American Taxpayers. Democrats only think there is one crime – Not voting for them! Instead of protecting Americans and their Tax Dollars, Democrats chose instead to prosecute anyone they can find that wanted Safe and Secure Elections. Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest. Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the “crime” of demanding Honest Elections. Today I am granting Tina a full Pardon for her attempts to expose Voter Fraud in the Rigged 2020 Presidential Election!\n\nPeters is unable to be pardoned by the president for state-level crimes.\n\nThe post Trump Tells ‘Scumbag’ Governor and ‘Disgusting’ ‘RINO’ to ‘Rot in Hell’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital.\n\nThe National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\n\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\n\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.\n\n“While this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation’s capital for generations to come,” the officials added.\n\nThe Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety. The Kennedy Center added Trump's name this month after the center's board of trustees — made up of Trump appointees — voted to change the name of the performing arts space designated by Congress as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. Trump is also in the midst of a construction project to build a ballroom on the White House's East Wing, and he has put his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace.",

    "fullText": "You won't be able to record any New Year's Eve festivities on a Trump phone.\n\nThough Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump — the president's two oldest sons — initially said that the gold-colored smartphone would come out in August, a Trump Mobile customer service representative told Business Insider that the phone won't be shipped until the end of January 2026, a delay they partially attributed to the recent government shutdown. The development was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nThe brothers first announced Trump Mobile, the line of Trump-branded smartphones, on June 16, the 10-year anniversary of President Donald Trump's first presidential campaign launch. The $499 gold-colored T1 smartphone largely resembles modern Android devices, and was originally advertised as being made in the US — drawing questions from the tech community on how the company would hit that price point without relying on foreign part or supply chains.\n\nWithin days of the launch, the \"MADE IN THE USA\" wording was removed from the Trump Mobile website. The phone is now simply described as \"brought to life right here in the USA\" and made with \"American hands.\" Trump has previously threatened Apple with tariffs if the company doesn't shift iPhone manufacturing to the US, though some think that fully recreating the production domestically is nearly impossible.\n\nTrump Mobile is also offering the \"47 Plan,\" which would provide services like unlimited texting, calling, and data, roadside assistance, and even tele-health services, for $47.45 per month — a reference to Trump's status as both the 45th and 47th president of the United States.\n\nAmid its missed launch window, the company has also started selling secondhand phones from Samsung and Apple for between $369 and $629.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump Mobile's X account has lain dormant for four months — the last post the company made was on August 27.\n\nSwitch to the service you deserve & keep the phone you love!\n\nMore than unlimited talk, text & data—your plan includes:\n\n🩺💻 24/7 Telehealth\n🚗🛠️ Roadside Assistance\n📱🛡️ Device Protection\n🌎📞 International Calling\n\nSame phone. Same number. Way better service.… pic.twitter.com/c8V4BdJFSt\n\nDespite the delay in the release, Trump Mobile is still accepting pre-orders for $100, with the remaining $399 charged when the phone finally arrives.",

We just had the longest one on record and now it looks like we're going to be walking into the new year with the possibility of another one. Uh, then, can you game that one out, too?\n\nYeah, happy to. I don't think that we're going to get another shutdown. I generally tend to think that we won't shut it down. The Democrats proved their point in the 45-day shutdown uh earlier this year, and I don't think the language we're getting from leader Schumer is indicative of another shutdown.\n\nUm, one of the things that I would really suggest point out is it's not necessarily about a policy win, you know, the ACA subsidies are going to expire. So you're going to be paying more for your healthcare next year. 200 bucks if you're below 40, up to $920 if you're over the age of 60. That's going to happen starting, well, I guess tonight.\n\nUm, and as we get into the end of this year, that's what the conversation is going to be, but because there's no consensus on moving forward and Democrats have made their point and Republicans are you know, guaranteeing that there will be votes and we're going to have this conversation, we'll talk about it, but I don't think we're going to shut it down. So, my odds are 25%. I think fade that. I I don't think we're going to shut down going into February.",

    "description": "The monument would be a centerpiece of the White House’s plans for America’s 250th birthday.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said in an interview Wednesday that construction of his long-teased Triumphal Arch is expected to begin “sometime in the next two months.”\n\nThat would put the start date ahead of July 4, 2026 — as the White House ramps up preparations for the nation’s 250th anniversary next year.\n\n“It hasn’t started yet. It starts sometime in the next two months. It’ll be great. Everyone loves it,” Trump told POLITICO when reached by phone from Mar-a-Lago. “They love the ballroom too. But they love the Triumphal Arch.”\n\nThe proposed structure — modeled loosely on European victory monuments — is one of several high-profile projects Trump has personally championed as part of the semiquincentennial celebrations, a sprawling effort expected to include national and local events across the country.\n\nThe president has at times displayed a model of the proposed arch in recent months. There have been plans to build it by the Lincoln Monument, on the other end of a bridge leading to Arlington National Ceremony.\n\nTrump has framed the project as a patriotic landmark meant to honor American history and military service, though critics have raised questions about cost, aesthetics and whether the executive branch has the authority to unilaterally move forward with such construction in Washington.\n\nHe has also promoted an Ultimate Fighting Championship event on White House grounds on June 14.\n\nAsked who he would want to fight at the White House UFC match, Trump deferred to UFC President Dana White, a longtime ally, to make the selections. “Well, Dana’s picking them. He’s the best fight picker there is, right?” Trump said. “He’s going to pick all of the top fighters. Going to be all championship matches. It’ll be the best ever, I think. Really incredible.”\n\nTrump said there could be “many matches, like 10,” suggesting the event would be a championship-level showcase rather than a single bout.\n\nIn a separate interview with POLITICO last week, Trump spoke about the Republican Party’s plans for the midterms, arguing the election will be about “pricing.” He also cast himself as the final decisionmaker for any peace deal in Russia’s war on Ukraine.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "title": "Kennedy Center reportedly changed rules before vote to add Trump’s name",
    "description": "Bylaws that would limit voting to Trump-appointed trustees appears to reveal long-held renaming plan",
    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.\n\nThe bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.\n\nTrump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).\n\nJust prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.\n\nThe center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.\n\nRoma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”\n\nDaravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”\n\nEllen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.\n\n“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.\n\nThe disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.\n\nAs artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — U.S. immigration officials do not plan to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia again as long as a judge’s order banning it stands, according to a Tuesday court filing.\n\nThe plans by President Donald Trump’s administration are the latest in the saga over the Salvadoran citizen’s case that has become a lightning rod for both sides of the immigration debate as he fights to remain in the U.S. after a mistaken deportation to his home country, where he was imprisoned.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement did make clear they would detain Abrego Garcia if the order was lifted, Liana J. Castano, assistant director for field operations, wrote in the filing.\n\nTrump officials have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record. The administration brought him back to the U.S. in June under a court order, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this month questioned whether government officials could be trusted to follow orders barring them from taking Abrego Garcia back into immigration custody or deporting him.\n\nA Justice Department push to indict\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Abrego Garcia revealed that high-level Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.\n\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in federal court to the human smuggling charges. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive, arguing the Trump administration is targeting him as punishment for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.\n\nTo support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022.\n\nAbrego Garcia had recently been in immigration custody for three months before Xinis ordered his release on Dec. 11. In that time, the government said it planned to deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.\n\nIn her Dec. 11 order, Xinis found that immigration officials had no viable plan to remove Abrego Garcia from the U.S. and said he could not be held indefinitely. She issued a separate order barring ICE from re-detaining him, at least for the time being. After a hearing on the issue, Xinis ordered the government to file the brief they released Tuesday outlining whether they planned to detain Abrego Garcia again.\n\nAbrego Garcia's human smuggling case stems from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee where he was pulled over for speeding with nine passengers in the car. State troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.\n\nThe newly unsealed Dec. 3 order from U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw compelled the government to provide some documents to Abrego Garcia and his attorneys, although it does not give a lot of detail on their contents.\n\nClaims of a ‘vindictive’ prosecution\n\nEarlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Abrego Garcia could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Abrego Garcia because he had won his wrongful deportation case.\n\nRob McGuire, who was the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Abrego Garcia.\n\nIn the unsealed order, Crenshaw writes, “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in DOJ and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr. McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established DOJ practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”\n\nThe email referenced was from McGuire to his staff saying Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” according to Crenshaw's order.\n\nThe order also shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, contacted McGuire about Abrego Garcia's case on April 27, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Abrego Garcia's favor on April 10.\n\nOn April 30, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the Deputy Attorney General's Office, according to the order. Singh and McGuire continued to communicate about the prosecution. On May 18, Singh wrote to McGuire and others to hold the draft indictment until they got “clearance” to file it. “The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.\n\nA hearing on the motion to dismiss the human smuggling case on the basis of vindictive prosecution is scheduled for Jan. 28.",

    "fullText": "TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday said his country’s answer to an attack would be harsh, which appeared to be in response to a warning by U.S. President Donald Trump over reconstruction of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging,” Pezeshkian said on the social media platform X.\n\nPezeshkian did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Trump suggested the U.S. could carry out military strikes if Iran attempts to reconstitute its nuclear program. Trump made the comment during wide-ranging talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\n“Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,” Trump said during a news conference with Netanyahu after their meeting. “And if they are, we’re going to have to knock them down. We’ll knock them down. We’ll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that’s not happening.”\n\nThe two leaders discussed the possibility of renewed military action against Tehran months after a 12-day air war in June that killed nearly 1,100 Iranians including senior military commanders and scientists. Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 people in Israel.\n\nTrump suggested Monday that he could order another U.S. strike against Iran.\n\n“If it’s confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,” Trump said.\n\nPezeshkian said Saturday that tensions between the sides already had risen.\n\n“We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don’t want our country to remain stable,” he said.\n\nIran has insisted it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60%, which is a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the largest protests in three years entered a third day Tuesday after the country’s currency plummeted to a record low against the U.S. dollar. The head of the Central Bank resigned on Monday.\n\nAccording to witnesses and videos on social media, rallies took place in Tehran and other cities and towns. Police fired tear gas in some places. Near a market in downtown Tehran, footage showed people pushing back police and security forces and throwing stones at them.\n\nUniversity students also rallied inside campuses on Tehran University and other major universities, witnesses said.\n\nPezeshkian met a group of businessmen to listen to their demands, media reported.\n\n\"The administration will not spare any effort for solving problems and improving situation of the society,” Pezeshkian said. He also assigned Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni for talks with protesters.\n\nThe head of the country’s tax department, Mohammad Hadi Sobhanian, also said the government will revise its tax arrangement in favor of businesses, dropping penalties for delay in paying taxes.\n\nThe government announced the closure of offices and banks on Wednesday for managing energy consumption during the winter days, to be followed by weekly holidays on Thursday and Friday. Saturday also is a religious holiday in the country.",

    "description": "Cabinet Office accused of cover-up after release of official papers referring to the King’s brother blocked",
    "fullText": "The Cabinet Office’s redaction of files relating to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been compared to the controversial treatment of the Epstein files.\n\nAndrew Lownie, a biographer of the former prince, said the decision to remove parts of the documents after they were released to journalists was “panicky”.\n\nMr Lownie, the author of Entitled, said: “It’s a bit like the Trump redactions (in the Epstein files). They’re slightly panicking and they do things without realising the consequences, trying to leave it or to play it down.\n\n“I think there’s just a huge panic. Anything to do with Andrew is being excised from the record because they’re worried about what it might reveal.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office was accused of covering up for the royal family after it emerged that official papers which refer to Andrew have been withheld from the National Archives.\n\nThe annual release of government papers under the 20-year rule to the archives in Kew, southwest London, includes a No 10 file from 2004 and 2005 on royal visits.\n\nThe version made available to journalists under embargo, so they could prepare stories in advance, included minutes of a meeting where officials discussed the travel plans of royals – including the then Duke of York, when he was a UK trade envoy.\n\nHowever, the minutes were later redacted from the file before it was released to the public.\n\nThe Cabinet Office, which is responsible for transferring the files to the National Archives, blamed an “administrative error”, saying they had never been intended for release.\n\nHowever, Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said there was no justification for withholding the documents, especially since Andrew has been stripped of his royal status amid continuing controversy over his links with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nLabour MP Rachael Maskell also urged the government to provide clarity on why the files were not published.\n\nMr Lownie said all files relating to Andrew’s time as trade envoy up to 2005 should be released and called for parliament to investigate.\n\nHe told the Times: “A huge cover-up has gone on [concerning] Andrew’s excessive expenditure, little of it profiting the country, and it continues. I believe there needs to be a full parliamentary investigation into Andrew’s decade as special representative.”\n\nEarlier this month, Andrew, who has always denied any wrongdoing, was formally stripped of his last remaining royal titles following controversy over his links to Epstein.\n\nThe redacted files showed discussions by senior palace and Foreign Office officials about Andrew’s travel plans as a UK trade envoy – which earned him the nickname “air miles Andy” – with visits to China, Russia, southeast Asia and Spain.\n\nOfficials also raised the issue of whether the Football Association would be prepared to pay for him to attend the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal as a royal representative.\n\nAlison McClean, a researcher at the University of Bristol, also told the paper that the three exemptions cited by the Cabinet Office, designed to protect documents containing communications with the sovereign, as well as personal data or confidentiality, were “questionable”.\n\nMcClean added: “It seems to demonstrate how even the most innocuous material concerning even minor members of the royal family is being routinely withheld. In this case it is especially worrying that information on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities as a UK trade representative are being blocked from release to the National Archives, as this relates to his role as a public servant rather than as a member of the royal family or, indeed, as a private citizen.”\n\nThe Cabinet Office said: “All records are managed in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act. Any release is subject to an extensive review process, including engaging expert stakeholders.”",

    "description": "The president took to Truth Social hours after the Kennedy family announced their tragic loss to share posts from MAGA supporters mocking the political dynasty",
    "fullText": "In the hours following the death of Caroline Kennedy's daughter Tatiana Schlossberg, President Donald Trump took to social media to mock the famous political family\n\nOn Truth Social on the afternoon of Dec. 30, Trump shared screenshots of MAGA supporters insulting the Kennedys for their response to his recent decision to add his own name to the Kennedy Center\n\nMembers of the family have claimed that Trump is barred from renaming the center \"by federal law,\" however, work crews have already added his name above JFK's on the historic memorial site\n\nAs the Kennedys mourned the untimely death of Tatiana Schlossberg — the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy — Donald Trump took to social media to share posts mocking the famous family.\n\nTatiana, the middle child of Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg, died on Tuesday, Dec. 30, at age 35, just over a month after publicly sharing that she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.\n\nThe news was shared by the social media accounts for the JFK Library Foundation, on behalf of Tatiana's family, which included her husband, Dr. George Moran, and their young children, Edwin and Josephine.\n\n\"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,\" read the post, which was signed by \"George, Edwin and Josephine Moran, Ed, Caroline, Jack, Rose and Rory.\"\n\nTrump did not directly mention Tatiana's death in his social media deluge following her death. Instead, he shared screenshots of MAGA supporters mocking the famous political family for their recent responses to his decision to add his name to the Kennedy Center, a historic performance venue in Washington, D.C., which was dedicated as a memorial to JFK following his assassination in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.\n\n\"The Kennedy Family have LONG neglected the Kennedy Center, btw,\" claimed one. \"They don’t raise money for it. They never show up. And the only Kennedy who has been there recently is a member of Trump’s cabinet.\"\n\n\"The Trumps have always been supporters of the arts. The Kennedys are supporters of the Kennedys,\" read another.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced on Thursday, Dec. 18, that the board of the historic venue had \"voted unanimously\" to rename the building to the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\" The following day, work crews added \"The Donald Trump and\" above the previously-existing lettering, which read, \"The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nHowever, controversy quickly arose among members of the Kennedy Center board and the family itself. Tatiana's brother, Jack Schlossberg, wrote on X that \"microphones were muted\" during the conference call where the board voted, and the outcome was \"NOT unanimous.\"\n\nJack's claim aligned with comments made by Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, who serves as an ex-officio member of the Kennedy Center board. Following the vote, Beatty took to X with allegations that she and other opponents of the vote were muted on the call and were not allowed to vote their differing opinions.\n\n\"For the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move,\" Beatty, 75, wrote. \"Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship.\"\n\nIn her video message, she continued, \"Clearly the Congress has a say in this. This center, the Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"\n\nOther Kennedys have approached the matter from a legal standpoint. \"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" wrote Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe Kennedys have yet to respond to Trump's latest attacks. The only family members who have posted to social media in the hours following Tatiana's death have been those sharing loving tributes, like Caroline's cousin, Maria Shriver, who was directly mocked in some of Trump's screenshots.\n\n\"I return to this space today to pay tribute to my sweet, beloved Tatiana, who left this earth today,\" Shriver wrote on X. \"I return to this space to pay tribute and honor her loving and supportive family, who came together and did everything they possibly could do to help her. I return to this space heartbroken because Tatiana loved life. She loved her life, and she fought like hell to try to save it.\"\n\n\"I cannot make sense of this. I cannot make any sense of it at all. None. Zero,\" she continued. \"My heart has always been with my cousin Caroline ever since we were little kids. My entire being is with her now. What a rock she has been.\"\n\n\"Those of us left behind will make sure Eddie and Josie know what a beautiful, courageous spirit their mother was and will always be. She takes after her extraordinary mother, Caroline. May we all hold Tatiana’s family in our collective embrace not just today, but in the days ahead, and may each of you who read this know how lucky you are to be alive right now. Please pause and honor your life. It truly is such a gift.\"",

    "fullText": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) — The United States and Ivory Coast signed a health deal Tuesday requiring the U.S. to commit $480 million to the West African nation’s health sector as part of “America First” global health funding pacts that mirror the Trump administration’s foreign policy.\n\nThe signing in Ivory Coast’s capital of Abidjan covers areas such as HIV, malaria, maternal and child health, and global health security. It is the latest agreement the U.S. has entered with more than a dozen African countries, most of them hit by U.S. aid cuts, including Ivory Coast.\n\nU.S. aid cuts have crippled health systems across the developing world, including in Africa, where many countries relied on the funding for crucial programs, including those responding to outbreaks of disease.\n\nThe new health pact is based on the principle of shared responsibility with Ivory Coast committing to provide up to 163 billion CFA francs ($292 million) by 2030, representing 60% of the overall commitment, according to Ivorian Prime Minister Robert Beugré Mambé.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Ivory Coast Jessica Davis Ba said the U.S. government is moving “beyond the traditional aid approach toward a model focused on trade, innovation, and shared prosperity.”\n\n“Today, our bilateral cooperation is entering a new phase. We are implementing the America First global health strategy,” the ambassador said.\n\nThe Trump administration says the new “America First” global health funding agreements are meant to increase self-sufficiency and eliminate what it says are ideology and waste from international assistance. The deals replace a patchwork of previous health agreements under the now-dismantled United States Agency for International Development.\n\nIn Ivory Coast, USAID had invested $115 million to support sectors such as health, education and aid for refugees mostly fleeing violence in neighboring Sahel states.\n\nAnalysts say the new approach to global health aligns with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pattern of dealing with other nations transactionally, using direct talks with foreign governments to promote his agenda abroad.",

    "description": "Artists are canceling shows after Trump’s name went on the Kennedy Center. Ric Grenell denies the link and threatens critics to silence dissent.",
    "fullText": "The renaming of the Kennedy Center triggered immediate fallout. Artists canceled performances. Longstanding relationships fractured. Programming began disappearing from the calendar. Ric Grenell’s response has been to insist none of this is his doing, and to threaten those who say otherwise.\n\nAfter the Trump-appointed board voted to add President Donald Trump’s name to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, cancellations followed quickly. A veteran jazz ensemble walked away from New Year’s Eve shows. A Christmas Eve jazz concert that had run for nearly two decades was called off. A New York dance company withdrew anniversary performances at a cost of $40,000. These were not symbolic gestures. They involved real money, professional risk, and decisions artists did not make lightly.\n\nGrenell, the Kennedy Center’s interim president/executive director and a senior Trump loyalist, responded by denying the causal relationship everyone could see. He insisted that adding Trump’s name “depoliticized” the institution. He also insisted that artists who withdrew were “far-left political activists,” acting for political reasons. In Grenell’s telling, the renaming did nothing, and the reaction proved everything.\n\nThat position requires believing that politics entered the Kennedy Center only when artists objected to the renaming, not when the renaming happened.\n\nGrenell did more than deny causality. He escalated. After Chuck Redd, the longtime host of the canceled Christmas Eve jazz concert, pulled out, Grenell publicly threatened him with a $1 million lawsuit. The message was unmistakable. Question the takeover and face consequences.\n\nThis is the point where denial turns into intimidation.\n\nThe artists who canceled did not issue partisan manifestos. The Cookers, a veteran all-star jazz septet featuring musicians with decades-long careers, spoke about jazz’s roots in freedom of expression. Doug Varone, the founder of a nationally respected contemporary dance company scheduled to mark its 40th anniversary at the center, described withdrawing as financially devastating but morally clarifying. These statements point in the same direction. The artists responded to a change in the institution itself, not to some abstract ideological grievance.\n\nGrenell’s response reframes that reality. By labeling dissenting artists extremists, he shifts attention away from the political act that set everything in motion. By threatening legal action, he discourages others from making the same connection publicly. Denial becomes policy, and enforcement follows.\n\nGrenell insists the arts are now “for everyone.” His actions define the terms of inclusion. Artists remain welcome as long as they perform without objection and accept the renaming as settled. Compliance is the price of neutrality. Artists who withdraw their labor are recast as political saboteurs. In this framework, politics is invisible when exercised by those in charge and intolerable when named by those affected.\n\nThe cost of this strategy is no longer theoretical. It is visible on the schedule. Performances have vanished. Institutions do not lose artists this way when they are perceived as neutral ground. They lose artists when trust breaks.\n\nGrenell has shamelessly argued that Trump “saved” the Kennedy Center. That claim is now testable. A saved institution does not hemorrhage programming weeks after a rebrand. A healthy cultural center does not require threats to maintain compliance. A revitalized stage does not grow quieter.\n\nThe political renaming backfired. The cancellations were the response. Grenell’s denial and intimidation are the attempt to erase that sequence.\n\nThe calendar keeps the record anyway.\n\nThe post The Trump-Kennedy Center Backfired. Ric Grenell Is Gaslighting Everyone first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "US presidents have each redecorated the Oval Office in their own unique ways since it was first built in 1909.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 100 years since the Oval Office was first built under President William Howard Taft. Throughout that time, US presidents have each made different design choices to redecorate the formal workspace.\n\nSome presidents, like President George H.W. Bush, have brought in their own furniture to replace the Resolute Desk. Others, like President Donald Trump, have reinstated vintage Oval Office pieces while adding their own personal flair.\n\nTake a look at how the Oval Office has changed through the years.\n\nInspired by the White House's oval-shaped Blue Room, the president's formal workspace was designed by architect Nathan C. Wyeth.\n\nTaft's Oval Office featured an olive-green color scheme.\n\nThe Oval Office was moved to the southeast corner of the White House.\n\nRoosevelt kept a variety of items on his desk, including photos of his sons, ceramic animal figurines, and an appointments easel with his daily schedule, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nTruman decorated the Oval Office with the turquoise rug and matching curtains. The walls were painted a lighter seafoam green.\n\nThe Resolute Desk, made of wood from the British ship H.M.S. Resolute, was gifted to President Rutherford B. Hayes by Queen Victoria in 1880. Previous presidents kept the desk in the second-floor office of the White House Residence and the Broadcast Room, according to the White House Historical Association.\n\nHe also redecorated the Oval Office with white drapes with red trim, evoking the American flag.\n\nNixon's Oval Office rug, in the same blue color as the American flag, was designed by first lady Pat Nixon.\n\nFord's decor included the wheel from the SS Mayaguez, an American container ship that was seized by Cambodian forces in 1975 and rescued at Ford's direction.\n\nThe clock, built between 1795 and 1805, has remained in the Oval Office under every subsequent president since 1975.\n\nOtherwise, he left most of Ford's decor.\n\nThe rug featured the presidential seal in the center with sunbeams emerging from the middle, surrounded by a border of olive branches.\n\nThe Resolute Desk was moved to the Residence Office.\n\nHockersmith designed the yellow curtains and the blue rug with the presidential seal. Clinton also chose to bring the Resolute Desk back to the Oval Office.\n\nThe rug featured a sunbeam design with the presidential seal at its center, reminiscent of Reagan's rug, and a lone star in a nod to Bush's home state of Texas.\n\nThe quote on the border of the rug read, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n\nHe also brought back Clinton's gold curtains and chose a new off-white wallpaper.\n\nBiden hung portraits of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMany of the gold decor pieces in Trump's Oval Office came from the White House collection, but Trump also imported some statuettes from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nTrump also added flags representing different branches of the US military and additional presidential portraits, with President George Washington in the prominent center spot above the fireplace mantle.",
