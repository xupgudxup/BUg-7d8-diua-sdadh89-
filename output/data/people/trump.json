    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "description": "Mark Zandi told Business Insider that the idea to cap credit card interest would hurt borrowers, while Trump's mortgage plan could raise home prices.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has floated some big ideas to make life more affordable for everyday Americans in the last week, but one veteran economist has his doubts that they'll make much of a difference.\n\nIn fact, he sees the plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest as potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nTrump revealed plans to bring down mortgage rates and make credit card debt cheaper. For mortgages, he said he had directed \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion of mortgage bonds, while his plan for credit cards entails capping interest at 10% for a year.\n\nThe president framed both plans as being in the interest of US consumers, but Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi thinks that both moves could end up having the opposite effect.\n\nZandi spent much of 2025 sounding the alarm over Trump's policies, which he said could push the US toward a recession, and he's remained pessimistic so far in 2026.\n\nZandi posted on X that the news of Trump's housing market plan has already pushed fixed mortgages down by 10 to 20 basis points. While that sounds like good news for borrowers and is likely exactly what Trump wants to see, the sudden dip in rates could ultimately drive home prices up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this will do little to make homebuying more affordable, as while the lower rates will support housing demand, given the severe housing shortage, it will also result in higher house prices, all else equal,\" he said.\n\nZandi also warned that Trump's intention to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pile up mortgage bonds could pose further complications. He said it would effectively weaken a safeguard imposed on the two mortgage giants following the 2008 housing market crash that was meant to keep them from posing a systemic risk to the economy.\n\nZandi also said he had issues with Trump's credit card idea.\n\nHe told Business Insider that while he sees little chance that Trump's plan for a cap on credit card interest rates would clear legal hurdles, the move would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.\n\n\"Only consumers with high credit scores would avoid having their credit lines reduced or eliminated altogether,\" he said. \"That's because banks and other credit card lenders simply won't be able to profitably extend credit cards at a 10% rate to many Americans.\"\n\nZandi predicted that higher-income households would benefit from lower rates middle and lower income people would be shut out.\n\nAnalysts at UBS echoed Zandi's perspective on credit card rate caps, arguing that caps on credit card interest could harm not just lower-income consumers but the broader economy, as it would mean less spending. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman responded with a similar argument, stating that he thinks such a move would be a mistake.",

    "title": "Trump’s Slash-and-Burn Economy Is Devastating Black Women",
    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

    "description": "The market reaction to Trump's latest attack on the Fed wasn't as sharp this time.",
    "fullText": "Even by his own market-moving standards, President Trump has been on a real tear lately.\n\nIt's been just over a week since he sent oil stocks surging by imploring US drillers to invest in the revitalization of Venezuela.\n\nAnd it's only been a few days since he stirred up volatility in defense stocks by first demanding they stop buybacks and dividends, then smoothing things over by pledging $1.5 trillion in military spending.\n\nThe Trump administration's latest major market disruption started on Sunday, on news the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to the Fed over a testimony from Jerome Powell on building renovations.\n\nIf there's one thing the market has shown in recent years, it's that it doesn't like any sort of challenge to Fed independence. The standard rebellious response to this, over time, has been the \"Sell America\" trade, which sees traders dump US stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar.\n\nWhat transpired on Monday was hardly the most drastic \"Sell America\" event we've had (and we've had a few at this point). But it still sets high stakes for the three asset classes in question:\n\nAfter an initial knee-jerk reaction sharply lower, major US indexes finished the day slightly higher. It was a more muted reaction than we've seen after past Fed attacks.\n\nPerhaps investors are already invoking the TACO trade, and expecting Trump to \"chicken out\" and temper his stance. It's also possible that, at this point, they're simply used to Powell brushing off Trump and forging ahead. Plus he also only has four months left in his term.\n\nA client note from the JPMorgan Securities trading desk stressed caution around stocks in the wake of the DOJ subpoenas. The firm said the latest threats make the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on Trump's ability to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook even more important.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose as much as 4 basis points on Monday before paring the increase. This is a common reaction under the \"sell America\" trade as investors dump US-denominated debt. Still, like with stocks, the reaction was minor.\n\nGiven the lack of reaction, attention is instead focused on last week's December jobs report. The data prompted JPMorgan's chief US economist to adjust his rate-cut forecast. He now expects zero cuts in 2026, and a rate hike in 2027.\n\nIf the \"Sell America\" narrative persists in any form — and if the market eventually agrees the Fed's rate-cut voyage is truly over — expect yields to rise again.\n\nThe dollar index — which assesses the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — fell as much as 0.5% on Monday. Divesting from the dollar is a core element of the \"Sell America\" trade.\n\nThe dollar is fresh off being the worst-performing major currency of 2025. While a weak currency comes with some positives — like a nation's exports being worth more — it can also reflect a lack of faith in its financial system.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump isn't backing down from his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, even as an increasing number of fellow Republicans express a desire to cool tensions.\n\n\"Well, he's billions of dollars over budget,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday morning before departing for a trip to Michigan. \"So, he's either incompetent or he's crooked. I don't know what he is, but he certainly doesn't do a very good job.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Powell released an extraordinary video statement, confirming that he is under a criminal investigation for testimony he gave before Congress about renovations to the Fed's headquarters. Powell said that the probe was being conducted in retaliation for his repeated defiance of Trump's wishes regarding the independent central bank's setting of interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a nearly two-minute video released by the Fed.\n\nPowell and the Fed have repeatedly denied that there is anything untoward about the cost overruns for the $2.5 billion renovations. In July, Powell accompanied Trump on a tour of the site where the pair sparred in front of reporters about the project.\n\n\"You just added in a third building is what that is,\" Powell said in July after Trump cited a figure that was higher than other estimates. \"It was built five years ago.\"\n\nAn FAQ on the Fed's website said the project has been costlier than expected due to a number of factors, including changes to the design, a larger-than-expected amount of asbestos, and the increase in the cost of materials.\n\nTrump told NBC News he had no knowledge of grand jury subpoenas being sent to the Fed. Amid a firestorm, US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said that the Justice Department had no alternative but to subpoena the information.\n\n\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro said in a statement posted on X on Monday night.\n\nIn 2017, Trump nominated Powell, who was already a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, to lead the central bank. Since then, Trump has soured on Powell and at times has mused about firing the Fed chair, though legal experts have disputed whether any president would have the power to do so.\n\nThe criminal probe into Powell could prove costly for the White House. Powell's term as chair is up in May. For months, Trump has conducted a public search for his replacement. In a closely-divided Senate, Trump cannot afford to lose Republican support for any potential nominee.\n\nAfter Powell's statement was released, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said he would not support any Trump nominee until the investigation \"is fully resolved.\" Tillis serves on the Senate Banking Committee, where Republicans hold a 13-11 majority. If Tillis remained opposed, the committee could deadlock — likely stalling the nomination or, at the very least, requiring Republicans to take the rare step of changing the chamber's rules.\n\nBeyond Tillis, a handful of other Republicans on Capitol Hill have also decried the criminal probe. All three living former Fed chairs, including Reagan appointee Alan Greenspan, have lined up behind Powell, as have the current leaders of central banks around the world.",

    "fullText": "MS NOW host Rachel Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.\n\nThe second term of Trump’s presidency has seen a steady erosion of support over issues like the Epstein files and rebukes from federal courts over a raft of policies. But those rebukes have picked up pace recently.\n\nOn Monday night’s edition of MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, the host ticked through the latest of them. She then gloated that Trump “is losing all the time and everywhere now”:\n\nYou might not have seen the headline today that today a federal court blocked the Trump administration from cutting energy funding just for blue states. This is billions of dollars Congress appropriated for clean energy projects of various kinds all over the country.\n\nTrump administration decided, and they admitted this — they decided that just in blue states, just in states that didn’t vote for Trump, they would cut all of that funding. They’d leave the funding in place in states that voted for Trump. They would cut it in states that didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nA federal court today ruled that that is illegal and stopped the Trump administration from doing that. That ruling today came after another federal court today stopped Trump from shutting down a big offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Trump’s shutdown of that project, according to the courts today, was also illegal.\n\nAnd so, yet another federal court blocked Trump on that as well. So that work on the wind farm will be able to go ahead. Both of those rulings today follow.\n\nLast night, yet another federal court blocking Trump, this time from cutting funding to the American academy of pediatrics. This is a doctor’s group of pediatricians group that criticized the flock of ducks level insane quackery at Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services under RFK Jr.\n\nTrump responded by canceling federal grants for the American Academy of Pediatrics. A judge has now ruled that that was illegal retaliation. And so, Trump is blocked from doing that. That funding has to be reinstated.\n\nThat ruling comes after another federal judge just blocked Trump from cutting off federal election funds to states in retaliation for them not changing their election rules in ways that Trump wants. The judge said, quote, “the Constitution assigns no authority to the president over federal election administration.” And so, Trump got blocked on that one, too.\n\nShall I keep going? I could keep going. Another federal court just blocked Trump from freezing billions of dollars for childcare and social services for kids, again, in Democratic run states, as some kind of punishment against those states for electing Democrats, punishing them for that by cutting off the temporary assistance to needy families program.\n\nBecause, you know, you know, what would Jesus do? Trump was also just blocked from a — from doing that by yet another federal court.\n\nIt`s almost like he is losing all the time and everywhere now. There may still be people in America who are shocked that Trump keeps breaking the law over and over again, blatantly and insistently. The courts no longer appear to be shocked by that, and the courts now are just telling him no very bluntly, every single day, and often multiple times a day.\n\nAnd it’s not even just the courts, as I know you are aware, last week in one 48-hour stretch, we had a Senate vote for a War Powers resolution to block Trump from any further military adventurism. In Venezuela, five Republican senators crossed over to side with Democrats to pass that War Powers resolution. It was enough to advance that it’s going to get another vote in the Senate this week.\n\nThat came right on the heels of 17 Republicans in the House breaking ranks with Trump and siding with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act to try to, at least temporarily, undo the disastrous decision Trump and Republicans made in their so-called big beautiful bill. The decision to send tens of thousands of American families’ health insurance rates through the roof.\n\nSeventeen Republicans crossed over, defied Trump and joined with Democrats to pass that health care matter in the House.\n\nNow it`s going to come to the senate. Trump is now whining about how he might have to veto it if and when it passes in the senate as well, because he definitely wants to make sure that people’s health insurance premiums double or triple in cost for nothing other than something that he personally did. He apparently wants that.\n\nI mean, what we’ve just seen in Congress is one of the worst rebukes Trump has had from congressional Republicans since he has been back in office this whole disastrous year.\n\nWatch above via MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nThe post MS NOW’s Rachel Maddow Taunts Trump Over Blizzard of Defeats: ‘Losing All the Time and Everywhere!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Sources in touch with Bondi told the Journal that she was growing increasingly concerned about Trump’s complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department has brought charges against several Trump antagonists, but prosecutors have faced substantial setbacks.\n\nThe government is appealing November’s dismissals of its cases against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey after a judge ruled that Trump had illegally appointed Lindsey Halligan, the attorney who obtained those indictments.\n\nSince that ruling, the Trump administration has tried and failed on two separate occasions to persuade a grand jury to indict James.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, was indicted in October for allegedly mishandling classified documents. A trial date has yet to be determined.\n\nYet another investigation was revealed on Sunday. The Justice Department is now probing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about the bank’s building renovation.\n\nAccording to Trump, Bondi is also coming up short when it comes to the Epstein files, which have long cast a shadow over his presidency. That the government has produced less than 1 percent of its files, despite a law requiring their release last month, has only intensified scrutiny over the Trump-Epstein relationship and the president’s handling of it.\n\nThe Journal cites two officials who said that Trump agreed with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles’ assessment to Vanity Fair that Bondi “whiffed” on the issue.\n\nTrump’s obsession with the 2020 election has also led him to demand more from the Justice Department, according to the report.\n\nLast month, Trump resorted to issuing a symbolic pardon of Tina Peters, the former Colorado county elections clerk convicted of seven state charges, including tampering with voting machines. Peters remains in prison serving a nine-year sentence.\n\nTrump has occasionally confronted Bondi directly about his list of grievances, officials told the Journal.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House provided statements from Trump, Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—all praising Bondi.\n\n“Pam is doing an excellent job,” said Trump.\n\n“She has been my friend for many years,” he added. “Tremendous progress is being made against radical left lunatics who are good at only one thing, cheating in elections and the crimes they commit.”\n\nThe Justice Department, in a brief statement, did not address the substance of the Journal’s report, telling the Daily Beast merely that Bondi “is focused on executing President Trump’s directive to Make America Safe Again.”",

    "fullText": "As the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement nationwide, a wave of high-profile arrests — many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video — has pushed one legal question into the center of the national debate: When can federal immigration agents lawfully enter private property to make an arrest?\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency in cities like Minneapolis, where thousands of federal agents are operating on the streets amid protests, confrontations and a fatal shooting, sharpening scrutiny of the legal authority immigration officers rely on when they arrive at the front door.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is a legal distinction largely unfamiliar to the public but central to immigration enforcement.\n\nMost immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only criminal warrants signed by judges carry that authority. Legal experts say the administration’s aggressive enforcement push, combined with public awareness of those limits, is increasingly turning door-knock encounters into flashpoints, fueling confrontations that are now playing out in cities across the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the limitations on the warrants that authorize most immigration related arrests.\n\nImmigration warrants typically don't authorize entry onto private property\n\nAll law enforcement operations — including those conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means law enforcement is required to have a warrant before searching one's private property or arresting someone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nBut not all warrants are the same. Typically, arrests carried out by Department of Homeland Security agencies are authorized by administrative warrants — sometimes known as immigration warrants — not judicial warrants.\n\nJudicial warrants are issued by a court and signed by a magistrate or a state or federal judge. These warrants allow a relevant law enforcement agency to apprehend a specified individual in any context — regardless of whether the person is on public or on private property. In other words, law enforcement is legally allowed to enter and search a home or business to make the arrest without the consent of the property owner once a judge signs off on the arrest.\n\nThat means people can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant.\n\nThere are limited exceptions, some of which include if someone is in immediate danger, an officer is actively chasing a suspect or if someone is calling for help inside the residence. But those exceptions don't apply in routine immigration arrests, legal experts say.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former ICE acting director, said officers are trained on what circumstances legally justify forced entry. But as the scope of ICE's work has expanded, and more Border Patrol agents have begun conducting the work of ICE officers, there is a greater chance that agents will misapply the rules, he said.\n\n“Your risks of all of these types of incidents increase dramatically when you take officers out of their normal operating environment and ask them to do things that they have not been trained to do, because it’s not part of their core missions,” Sandweg said.\n\nMounting tensions in Minneapolis\n\nThe thorny legal distinction between judicial and administrative warrants came to the fore on Sunday when immigration law enforcement raided a private home to make an arrest in Minneapolis, after clashing with protesters who confronted the heavily armed agents. Documents reviewed by The Associated Press revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge that authorized the raid on private property.\n\nWhen asked, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin didn't provide a legal justification for the forced entry and arrest of the man, who is a Liberian national with a deportation order from 2023. She said his arrest was part of the administration's efforts to arrest “the worst of the worst” and added that he had that a criminal history including “robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.\"\n\nMcLaughlin didn't specify whether he was convicted of any of those crimes, or whether his arrest was related to any criminal activity.\n\nVice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, Heidi Altman, said she couldn’t comment on that specific raid, but said that generally an officer entering a home without consent or permission could result in serious consequences.\n\n“That is not just an illegal arrest. It’s numerous illegal actions by the officer themselves that could open up liability, not just for being sued, but potential criminal actions under state law as well,” she explained.\n\nBut in the current political climate, Altman said, it isn’t clear if there are any realistic avenues for accountability since the federal government would be responsible for investigating such a breech.\n\n“There are layers of federal laws and regulations and policies prohibiting this kind of behavior. But then the second layer is: Is the federal government going to impose consequences?\" she said.\n\nOn top of that, immigrants have less recourse after an illegal arrest or search, since the illegally obtained evidence can still be used in immigration court. It’s called the exclusionary rule, Altman explained, and the consequences that the officer may face would not undo the immediate consequences immigrants could face if they are quickly deported.\n\n“As those legal challenges come and people are facing very, very quick detentions and deportations on the basis of these illegal arrests, there’s very little recourse in actual immigration court proceedings that allows people to have a judge disregard evidence or the actual arrest, even if it was done in this very violent, illegal manner,” Altman said.\n\nICE has long relied on “knock and talks\" to make apprehensions, informally requesting residents to leave a home without giving any indication they plan to make an immigration arrest. As outlined in a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal, officers tell their targets that they need them to step outside to answer a few questions. In one case, they told a woman that they were probation officers looking for her brother.\n\nIn response, activists, lawyers and local governments have launched “know-your-rights” campaigns around the country, attempting to educate people on the legal nuances of the extremely convoluted legal framework that is supposed to govern immigration law enforcement.\n\nMany groups have published fact sheets and infographics on social media, while others facilitate meetings that go over constitutional protections that immigrants have — regardless of legal status — in interactions with federal agents.\n\nOften groups will instruct immigrants to request to see a warrant before opening the door if an immigration officer knocks. The trainings also typically emphasize that an immigrant can refuse to open the door if law enforcement only has an administrative warrant.",

    "description": "Americans' debt loads are at record highs, resurfacing a decadeslong debate on how to prevent companies from maximizing profit at consumers' expense.",
    "fullText": "Americans are racking up credit card debt, and it's costing them even more to get rid of it.\n\nIt's a piece of the affordability debate that has caught the attention of both parties.\n\nIn a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. He wrote in a Truth Social post that he would call for the cap to begin on January 20.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen.\n\nWarren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she \"told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"\n\nHowever, beyond the mechanics of the proposal, the underlying sentiment — that credit card companies have \"ripped off\" consumers by charging excessive interest — is an issue that has plagued the US for decades as debt loads continue to rise.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nTrump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move.\n\nIn February 2025, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that \"working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon.\"\n\nEven as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances.\n\nIt's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said.\n\n\"Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that,\" Rust said.\n\nAt the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nThere's limited legal recourse for consumers. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.\n\nOversight over the industry is lacking, especially after the Trump administration moved to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB conducts oversight of the industry and found, in a 2023 report, that credit-card companies charged consumers over $105 billion in interest in 2022, helping to boost their profit margins from 4.5% in 2019 to 5.9%.\n\nSome credit-card companies took issue with Trump's proposal. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the \"cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans. Banks typically use higher interest rates to compensate for customers who might not be able to pay back their loans.",

    "description": "The criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to further complicate Donald Trump's timeline for naming his replacement.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's search to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has taken a major turn in the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Powell confirmed an explosive report that he is facing a criminal investigation related to his prior testimony to Congress about the $2.5 billion renovation to the Fed's headquarters.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell said that the probe was in retaliation for his decision to ignore Trump's wishes on rate cuts.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.\n\nTrump told NBC News that he had nothing to do with the grand jury subpoenas sent to the Fed, adding that Powell is \"certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.\"\n\nNews of the probe has complicated Trump's path to replacing Powell, whose term ends in May.\n\nHere's where Trump's search stands and who is on top of his list.\n\nKevin Hassett, one of Trump's top economic advisors, has long been considered a likely pick to replace Powell.\n\nAs of January, Hassett is tied with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, at 40% for the odds of being Trump's pick at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nAsked about the criminal probe into Powell, Hassett said it made sense to investigate why the Fed's renovations overran their initial cost estimates. (The Fed has said costs went up due to changes in design, the increase in cost of materials, and unforeseen complications such as a larger amount of asbestos than anticipated.)\n\n\"I think that it's really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that,\" Hassett told reporters outside the White House on January 12.\n\nBefore joining Trump's orbit, Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020.\n\nIn October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman \"Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.\" Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold.\n\nTrump has long praised Warsh, the other Kevin on his shortlist to replace Powell.\n\nIn December, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Warsh was at the top of his list.\n\n\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both—I think the two Kevins are great,\" he told the publication. \"I think there are a couple of other people that are great.\"\n\nMonths earlier, Trump told reporters that Hassett, Warsh, and current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller were \"the top three.\"\n\nIn leading prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, Warsh's odds surged in mid-December, then shrank, and are now trending higher once again.\n\nBack in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017.\n\nWarsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House.\n\nDrawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street.\n\nFrom the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\n\n\"The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them,\" Warsh told CNBC in July. \"So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.\"\n\nFed Gov. Christopher Waller, who currently serves alongside Powell on the central bank, has previously said that he thought his interview went well.\n\nIn late November, Waller told Fox News he was pleased about his conversation with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led Trump's search process.\n\nIn mid-December, CNBC reported that unnamed senior administration officials said Waller had a \"strong interview\" with Trump himself.\n\nDespite optimism in the press, Waller's odds have collapsed in leading prediction markets. As of January, Waller is under 10% at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nWaller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's.\n\nIn December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times.\n\nIn July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years.\n\nThere's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist.\n\nRick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman was once thought to be a potential contender, but hasn't received the same buzz as other hopefuls in recent months.\n\nIn 2018, Trump appointed Bowman to the central bank.\n\nAfter confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision.\n\nBowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official.\n\nIn September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent.\n\nTrump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names.\n\nCNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James \"Jim\" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention.",

    "fullText": "A picture is worth a thousand words. A video makes a statement.\n\nFacing down the threat of a potential criminal indictment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn't write a press release.\n\nInstead, he turned to the camera, literally, to respond to what he described as the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nThe choice was out of character for Powell, who's known for measured, not reactionary, responses during his Fed tenure. But the video enabled Powell to project calm while also signaling the significance of the moment, communication and leadership experts told BI's Ana Altcheck and Tim Paradis.\n\n(If you need a refresher, here's the backstory on Powell's Senate testimony that's the basis for the DOJ probe.)\n\nPowell's response is worth examining as President Donald Trump continues to pick fights across the business world. Look no further than the oil industry, where Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela after its CEO said the country is currently \"uninvestable.\"\n\nIt's a strategy we've seen before from Trump.\n\n\"Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen,\" writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nIt's also part of a new form of capitalism that Trump is ushering in, including the government sometimes taking stakes in individual companies and leaning on public offices meant to remain independent. We're following it all this year with our series on \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nEven if Trump wins the battle with Powell, he could still lose the war on rate cuts\n\nHeading into the year, investors expected two standard cuts from the central bank in 2026. Now JPMorgan is questioning if we'll even get one.\n\nStrong job and GDP growth, coupled with inflation sitting above 3%, has JPMorgan predicting the Fed will hold rates steady for the entire year. And that's even if Trump installs a Fed chair who's more keen to cut rates.\n\n\"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist.\n\nAs if things couldn't get worse, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has an even starker prediction: a rate hike.\n\nSløk said the massive amount of AI-led borrowing means companies issuing more bonds. The increase in investment-grade bonds could draw investors away from the Treasury market, potentially forcing rates higher.",

    "fullText": "The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "Greenland’s leaders and residents have hit back at President Donald Trump’s takeover talk, saying they are tired of being treated like a prize to be claimed.\n\nGreenlandic MP Per Berthelsen told the Financial Times: “They are treating us as if we were merchandise in a shop. I have difficulties seeing the difference between the way the Americans are acting towards Greenland, and Russia, where you can see that the interest is to make their [territory] bigger.”\n\n“We are not for sale. We don’t want to be Americans, we want to be Greenlanders,” Berthelsen, a former Greenlandic foreign minister, told the Financial Times.\n\n“I don’t want to live in an American empire,” resident Maja Overgaard said in the same report, while fisherman Helte Johannsen dismissed Trump outright: “I don’t think that Trump knows anything about Greenland.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his threats to take over Greenland after the U.S. kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in an unprecedented military move, and said it would run the country during a transition period.\n\nDuring a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Sunday, the president was asked whether he was still planning U.S. military action against Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“If we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will,” Trump said. “And I’m not letting that happen.”\n\nWhen asked if Greenland could “offer” him anything, he said, “Sure, I’d love to make a deal with them, that’s easier. But one way or the other, we’re gonna have Greenland.”\n\nTrump made a similar threat in a speech to Congress in March.\n\nOn Sunday, he clarified his approach: “Look, we’re talking about acquiring, not leasing, not having it short term. We’re talking about acquiring. And if we don’t do it, Russia or China will. And that’s not going to happen when I’m president.”\n\nHe repeated the threat Friday, telling reporters, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and added he would “do it the hard way” if a deal could not be reached.\n\nDenmark and Greenland have consistently rejected the idea, warning that U.S. military action could threaten NATO and emphasizing that Greenland is not for sale.\n\nLast week, Greenland’s government and opposition issued a joint statement: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, home to around 56,000 people mostly near Nuuk, is largely covered by ice but holds strategic and economic importance. Its location makes it vital to U.S. military early-warning systems, and melting ice has opened access to valuable resources, such as rare-earth minerals, drawing growing international interest.\n\n“It’s not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats—if you can call them that—from a giant like the US,” Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, told the BBC last week.\n\n“The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.”\n\nA 2025 Verian poll showed that only 6 percent of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9 percent undecided.",

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns.

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "description": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits",
    "fullText": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits different verdicts depending on who views it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have defended the agent and branded 37-year-old Renee Good a domestic terrorist. Local leaders and protesters across ​the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.\n\nSince the shooting last Wednesday, Reuters ‌has spoken to six Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 - part of a group of 20 whom Reuters has interviewed monthly since February - to better understand how they assess an incident caught on video that has been viewed by millions.\n\nEach of these half-dozen voters, ‌who vary in their assessments of Trump's immigration policy and overall performance, came away from the video with the same conclusion: The agent feared for his life and his decision to shoot Good was justifiable.\n\nTheir verdict mirrors that of the Trump administration. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters hours after the incident that Good had refused agents’ orders to move and then “proceeded to weaponize her vehicle.” Trump said on social media that the woman \"ran over the ICE Officer.\"\n\nMany Americans disagree. Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis this weekend to decry the killing and the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, called the Trump administration's assessment \"bullshit.\" Frey said the video showed an \"agent recklessly using power that resulted ⁠in somebody dying, getting killed.\"\n\nBut the video left all six voters convinced that ‌the agent shot Good because he thought she was trying to kill him. All expressed sympathy for the stressful conditions under which ICE and other law enforcement officers work, and many blamed Democratic leaders for inflaming anti-ICE sentiment, thereby making agents fear attacks from members of the public.\n\nAmanda Taylor, 52, an insurance firm employee near Savannah, Georgia, ‍who considers herself \"always pro-police,\" said the agent was \"protecting the community and protecting himself\" when he fired at Good.\n\nTaylor, who voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 and has had mixed feelings about Trump's economic policies and governing style, said the moment in the video when Good defied agents' orders to stop her car showed the agent she was a potential public threat.\n\n\"If they're running from you, what else are they gonna do?\" she said.\n\nThe first videos to widely circulate showed two ​masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at a perpendicular angle on a Minneapolis street. As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed ‌and then began driving forward, turning to the right.\n\nAnother officer, since identified as Jonathan Ross, was positioned in front of her car on the left. He drew his gun and fired three times, with the last shots aimed through the driver's side window. How much contact the car made with the officer, who stayed on his feet, has been widely debated.\n\nSeveral other voters also argued that Good's own actions led to her death. \"When I saw the video only one word came to mind, and that is 'disrespectful': another person failed to respect the law,\" said Herman Sims, 66, a night operations manager for a trucking company in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\"We won't ever know what would have happened if she kept going. Would she have run over someone else in the street blocks away?\" Sims said.\n\nChad Hill, 50, a supervisor at a nuclear power plant near his home in northwestern Ohio, ⁠also said the ICE agent was \"100% correct\" to use deadly force against Good once she had ignored officers' orders to ​stop.\n\n\"Putting a vehicle in drive and moving it toward a law enforcement officer is the same as drawing and pointing a gun,\" ​Hill said. He added that the \"political landscape in liberal cities has demonized ICE agents\" for merely doing their jobs.\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind it was self-defense,\" said Jon Webber, 45, a Walmart retail worker in Indiana who fully supports Trump's immigration crackdown. \"The moment she threw her car in [drive] and revved up, even if she was trying to ‍avoid the ICE agents, she came way too close.\"\n\nEven ⁠voters who had mixed feelings about the administration’s deportation drive felt the agent should not face legal consequences.\n\nDon Jernigan, 75, has previously told Reuters that some footage of ICE raids reminds him of Nazi Germany. But after viewing video of this incident, the Virginia Beach retiree said he thinks the ICE agent who shot Good should not be prosecuted, just retrained.\n\n\"When he was out of the way ⁠and she was beside him, yes, indeed, he shouldn't have shot at her,\" said Jernigan. \"But at that point, he didn't know. All he knew was somebody tried to kill him.\"\n\nAlthough Lou Nunez, 83, shares Jernigan's qualms about the aggressive tactics some ICE agents have ‌used during raids, he said he would not prosecute the one who shot Good. The Des Moines-based veteran said the officers \"work in a pressure-cooker situation\" and that the onus was on ‌Good to follow their orders.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.",

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Trump called for interest on credit cards to be capped for a year. UBS thinks that would end up hurting credit availability for some borrowers.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's idea to cap credit card interest could have far-reaching unintended consequences, UBS said on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was calling for a one-year, 10% rate cap for credit card interest, stating that the industry has been taking advantage of consumers.\n\nThe idea sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.\n\nWhile investors reacted to the latest threat to lenders' bottom line, UBS said that Trump's plan would have a negative impact on Main Street despite its intention to relieve high borrowing costs for many Americans.\n\nUBS analyst Erika Najarian said that the proposed credit card rate cap would likely backfire, as it would likely reduce consumer spending and curtail lending to certain borrower groups.\n\nNajarian said that credit card providers are more likely to dial back the availability of credit to certain borrowers, rather than simply offer cheaper credit.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that a 10% credit card rate cap would cut off credit availability to those that need it most: middle- and lower-income Americans,\" she added.\n\nThe team of analysts at UBS said that while they see a low likelihood of the plan becoming law, the overall impact on credit availability would be felt by both investors and consumers.\n\n\"According to the Boston Fed, the aggregate credit card spend by annual household income was as follows in May '25: 1) <$39k: ~$26bn; 2) $59-83k: ~$37bn; 3) >$121k: $175bn. Based on Boston Fed data, this means 26% of credit card spend, at least, would be at severe risk, implying a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP on average. Additionally, credit card spending accounts for nearly half of Visa's payment volume and more than half of Mastercard's. The kind of pullback predicted by UBS could severely compromise US economic growth.\n\nNajarian isn't the only finance pro to suggest that Trump's credit card rate cap plan could backfire. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman described it as a \"mistake\" and claimed that millions of credit cards could be cancelled as a result.",

Lower courts have found those tariffs to be illegal, and bettors on prediction market sites like Polymarket and Kalshi currently put the odds of a ruling against Trump at around 70%.\n\nIf that happens, the US may have to refund the billions of dollars in revenue that the government has collected from the IEEPA tariffs.\n\nTrump argued that the amount was worth \"Trillions of Dollars\" when accounting for investments that US companies have made to avoid tariffs.\n\n\"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about potential tariff refunds over the weekend, when he told Reuters that it \"won't be a problem if we have to do it.\"",

    "description": "The Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent from the president. The Justice Department investigation into Jerome Powell could change that.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump wants Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to do something Powell doesn't want to do.\n\nNow, Trump's federal prosecutors are now investigating Powell.\n\nThat's the shortest version of the news story that broke Sunday night, when Powell released an extraordinary statement and video, which I urge you to watch and read for yourself.\n\nKey quote from Powell, who Trump picked as Fed chair in 2017: \"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n(Trump told NBC on Sunday that he didn't have any knowledge of the investigation and that the DOJ wasn't trying to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. If you find that hard to believe, you might point to the fact that the investigation was reportedly authorized by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News anchor who is a longtime Trump ally.)\n\nAs Powell notes, using the threat of a criminal prosecution — fueled by a pretext — to pressure the Fed, which is meant to be independent of the White House but accountable to Congress, is unprecedented.\n\nBut the pattern most definitely has precedent in the Trump administration: Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen.\n\nIn this case, it's about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to lower rates. And more broadly, about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to answer to him.\n\nThat's why, prior to investigating Powell, he has also tried to remove Fed member Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee the Trump administration has accused of mortgage fraud. Cook fought Trump in court, and later this month the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case — and eventually rule on whether Trump can remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\n\nIt's easy to see many other examples of Trump trying the same thing. Trump, for instance, insisted that political enemies like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James should be prosecuted for … something. And when a Trump-appointed prosecutor declined to bring charges, Trump had him replaced with another appointee who would. Both of those cases have been dismissed by a federal judge, who said Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-installed US attorney who brought the cases, had been unlawfully appointed. The DOJ is appealing.\n\nOftentimes, the reactions to Trump's pressure campaigns amount to a shrug — Democrats complain, Republicans usually back him (or say nothing), and markets move around a bit before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nMaybe this time will be different: The Fed is supposed to be an institution that investors care about as a steady, guiding hand that doesn't swing wildly with political winds. Markets can ignore a lot of political ugliness; pressure on the Fed is harder to dismiss.\n\nThe broader pattern Powell is underlining goes well beyond monetary policy or even political score-settling. The administration has repeatedly paired aggressive action with a justification that is often strained at best. Prior to the raid that removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump and his proxies repeatedly insisted that Maduro and his country were killing countless Americans by bringing fentanyl into the US — which is not true. Last week, Kristi Noem, Trump's head of Homeland Security, said the shooting of a Minneapolis woman protesting an ICE raid was justified in part because she was a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\nSome of you will look at Trump's behavior and find something in there that you like, in an ends justify means formulation. Maduro was a terrible leader, so maybe you think that making up reasons to depose him doesn't matter much. Maybe you like Trump's deportation agenda, and aren't worried about him using masked agents with guns on city streets to make that happen.\n\nGive it time. We're still just a year into the second Trump administration, and his impulse to act without restraint has yet to find real pushback. \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me,\" he told The New York Times last week, when asked about the relevance of international laws and treaties. A president with an infinite target list and unchecked power is never finished.",

The White House did not provide additional information when reached by Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China and the United Arab Emirates are Iran's major trading partners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to reach a trade deal with China after both countries backed down from a tariff war in 2025. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the trade volume between China and Iran reached $13.37 billion in 2024, with China exporting $8.93 billion worth of goods to Iran and importing around $4.44 billion from the country. More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity shows that China exported $456 million and imported $208 million from Iran in October 2025.\n\nTrump's targeting of Iran comes as the country is experiencing mass protests against its government. Iran's crackdown on protesters has left hundreds dead and thousands arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.\n\nTrump has expressed support for the protesters and threatened the possibility of US involvement.\n\n\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"The USA stands ready to help!!!\"\n\nTrump's announcement also comes as the Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on the legality of the tariffs his administration has imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1970s-era law typically used by the President to impose sanctions.\n\nScott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, said in a petition to SCOTUS that the federal government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion in tariffs to American businesses should the duties be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nTrump also wrote in a post on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.\n\nThe approximately 15-minute call came after Sheinbaum said Friday she had requested dialogue with the Trump administration at the end of a week in which he had said he was ready to confront drug cartels on the ground and repeated the accusation that cartels were running Mexico.\n\nTrump has repeatedly offered to send the U.S. military after the cartels and Sheinbaum has always declined, but after the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.\n\n“He (Trump) asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrump “still insisted that if we ask for it, they could help” with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. “We told him, so far it’s going very well, it’s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch.”\n\nSheinbaum said Monday the two leaders agreed to continue working together.\n\nMexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente spoke Sunday with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for “tangible results” and more cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico shared those results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and fentanyl overdose deaths.\n\nExperts still see U.S. intervention in Mexico as unlikely because Mexico is doing what the U.S. asks and is a critical economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to do more.\n\nSheinbaum said the two leaders did not speak about Cuba, which Trump threatened Sunday. Mexico is an important ally of the island nation, including selling it oil that it will need even more desperately now that the Trump administration says it will not allow any more oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba.",

    "description": "Stocks, bonds, and the dollar fell amid the DOJ's investigation into Powell. Credit card stocks plunged after Trump said interest should be capped.",
    "fullText": "The \"sell America\" trade is seeing a revival on Monday.\n\nInvestors were reacting to developments over the weekend, including a proposal to cap credit card interest rates and the Department of Justice's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMajor indexes were down in early morning trading, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points as investors took in the news.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Monday:\n\nThe Justice Department's probe relates to the Fed Chair's testimony last year about the renovation of the Fed's office buildings, a project Trump has criticized for its cost.\n\nTrump, who said he has decided on his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term ends his May, said he had no knowledge of the probe when speaking to NBC Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe market has a complicated reaction to situations when it appears that Trump is applying pressure on Powell. The president has demanded that the Fed chief lower interest rates for years, including in his first term. The concern is that if rates are lowered prematurely, it could backfire and cause inflation to flare up again, which would force the central bank to turn hawkish and potentially hike rates down the road.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction among investors is something markets have seen before.\n\n\"All these moves suggest a possible return of the 'sell America' trade,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note on Monday, referring to the broad sell-off in US assets in 2025 as investors fretted over tariffs and the health of the economy.\n\n\"Investors rushed to cut their exposure to US assets,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note, pointing to concerns about the Fed's independence. \"Investors were also rattled by the Fed Chair's robust response,\" he added, referring to the video statement from Powell released on Sunday.\n\nHere were the moves investors saw Monday morning.\n\nTreasury yields were up as US debt securities faced selling pressure. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield climbed two basis points.\n\n\"Treasury yields are higher, and the curve is steeper amid fresh attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence,\" John Canavan, a lead analyst at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors have shed Treasurys in other times when the president has meddled with the Fed or threatened Powell. Yields spiked last April when Trump first said he could fire the Fed chair, with the president tempering his views following big bouts of selling in the Treasury market.\n\nGold, which acts as a hedge against inflation and a haven during bouts of geopolitical turmoil, soared to records, rising 2% and breaking through $4,600 for the first time on Monday.\n\nThe precious metal is up 4% from levels at the start of the year and just recorded its best-ever annual run since 1979, around the time inflation began to soar in the US.\n\nDemand for safe havens looks \"strong,\" particularly as investors continue to weigh tensions between the US and other countries, like Venezuela and Greenland, Trade Nation's Morrison said.\n\nOther metals that typically rally alongside gold, like silver and copper, were also up.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, declined 0.4% on Monday, a possible sign that investors are reducing their exposure to dollar assets due to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"The investigation into Mr Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy, an unfavourable backdrop for the greenback,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The broader fear is that the move could continue to erode Fed autonomy, which may raise long-term inflation expectations and be bearish for the greenback,\" Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, wrote in a note.\n\nThe financial sector was rocked after Trump proposed that credit card interest rates be capped at 10% for a one-year period in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration. AFFORDABILITY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\n\"Trump's proposal to cap credit card rates at 10% for a year added another layer of uncertainty, particularly for banks,\" Morrison added.",

    "description": "Meta named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman. She previously advised President Donald Trump and worked at Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "Meta has a new president — and she's a former advisor to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tech giant named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman on Monday. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April before resigning in December.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as a deputy national security advisor to Trump. The president applauded her appointment on Truth Social: \"A great choice by Mark Z!!\"\n\nPowell McCormick is the second former Trump official appointed to a Meta leadership position in 2026. Last week, the company hired C.J. Mahoney, a deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, as its chief legal officer.\n\nHere are three things to know about Dina Powell McCormick:\n\nPowell McCormick worked as a Trump advisor during his first term, with a focus on the Middle East.\n\nShe had a personal tie to the region. Powell McCormick was born in Cairo, where her father was a captain in the Egyptian army. In 1977, her family moved to Dallas.\n\nDuring her stint with the Trump administration, Powell McCormick oversaw a $200 billion US-Saudi arms deal, spearheaded Trump's Middle East tour, and was considered to take over as Trump's chief of staff or representative to the United Nations.\n\nShe left the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nPowell McCormick also served under President George W. Bush. She started in a personnel role, before rising to senior White House assistant and assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAt the time of her resignation in 2007, Powell McCormick was the highest-ranking Arab American in the Bush administration.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell McCormick went to Goldman Sachs, where she was hired as a managing director.\n\nPowell McCormick shot up in stature, making partner in three years. Her rapid rise sparked some bitterness among Goldman's underclass, according to The New York Times and Vanity Fair.\n\nUnder her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women program. She also oversaw the 10,000 Small Businesses program and served as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nPowell McCormick was popular among some of Goldman's biggest names, including Anne Black, the former president of Goldman Sachs Gives and current managing partner at JP Morgan.\n\n\"She was really a steadfast champion for me and others of us on the team, who were all promoted thanks to her,\" Black told Vanity Fair. \"She elevated my game, inspired me to be creative and bold, and expected us to show results.\"\n\nPowell McCormick left Goldman Sachs in 2023.\n\nWhile Powell McCormick no longer works in politics, she's still involved through her husband: Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick.\n\nThe couple wed in 2019. Soon after, Dave began eyeing a Senate run, and Dina became involved in the campaign. She made trips to Mar-a-Lago with her husband and appeared in several ads.\n\nDave ended up conceding the Republican nomination to Mehmet Oz — also known as television's Dr. Oz — in the 2022 race. Oz lost the general election to John Fetterman and was later appointed by Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nIn 2024, Dave ran again, narrowly winning a Senate seat and beating incumbent Bob Casey. Dina accompanied him to his swearing-in.",

    "fullText": "All three living former chairs of the Federal Reserve rushed to Jerome Powell's defense after the current Fed chair said he is under criminal investigation.\n\nThe former chairs, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, led the central bank under presidents of both major political parties, dating back to Greenspan's first appointment by President Reagan in 1987.\n\nThe statement is also signed by five former Treasury secretaries, including former Secretary Hank Paulson, who was President George W. Bush's final full-time leader of the department. Three other Treasury secretaries, Yellen, Jack Lew, and Timothy F. Geithner, served under President Obama. Former Treasury Secretary Richard Rubin served under President Clinton.\n\nThe entire statement is included below:\n\nOn Sunday night, Powell said that the Federal Reserve had received grand jury subpoenas related to his testimony before the Senate in the summer. A subpoena is not an indictment, but it does demonstrate the extent to which the Justice Department is willing to pursue the case.\n\nFor months, Trump and the White House have argued that Powell misled Congress in his discussion of the renovations to the Federal Reserve building. In July, Powell led Trump and reporters on a tour of the $2.5 billion renovation, although the episode did not end the tensions between the pair.\n\nIn his statement, Powell said that the criminal investigation was \"not about Congress's oversight role\" but rather retaliation for the Fed's repeated decisions to hold interest rates steady before voting to lower rates in September.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell (a power that no president may have over the central bank chair) and has engaged in a very public search for Powell's replacement. Powell's term runs through May.",

    "description": "Venezuela is home to the world’s largest reported oil reserves. The country’s other commodities have also caught the Trump administration’s attention.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says US companies will now have access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. But the country’s other commodities have also caught his administration’s attention.\n\nVenezuela has unverified amounts of minerals, metals and potentially rare earth elements, experts say. These raw materials are indispensable for industries from defense to technology, and the administration has repeatedly stressed their importance for US national security.\n\nBut while Washington might aspire to secure Venezuela’s critical elements, it’s a tall order, experts say, and wouldn’t do much to bolster America’s supply chain.\n\nThe quantity and economic viability of Venezuela’s mineral resources are uncertain. Companies also face major risks mining in Venezuela without sustained security guarantees.\n\nMany of these regions have guerrilla soldiers and armed groups engaging in illegal gold mining, experts say. Energy-intensive rare earths mining can also harm the environment.\n\n“There is an awareness within the administration that even beyond oil, there’s wider natural resource value in the country,” said Reed Blakemore, director of research at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center.\n\n“However, if we’re talking about the conditions under which we are able to exploit those mineral resources and bring them to market, it’s a much more challenging story,” Blakemore said. “And even, frankly, more challenging than the oil story.”\n\nEven if US companies were to try to mine Venezuela’s rare earths, getting them out of the ground is just one part of the process. Those materials are usually sent to China for refining.\n\nChina accounted for over 90% of global rare earths refining in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. The country maintains a virtual monopoly in processing and refining the materials due to decades of government subsidies, industry expansion and lax environmental regulations.\n\nRare earths have become a major sticking point in US-China trade tensions. Beijing last year implemented some export controls on rare earths during trade spats, raising concerns about America’s lack of secure supply chains for these critical materials.\n\n“China still holds near-singular capacity to process rare earth metals, and that industrial and geopolitical edge cannot be overcome overnight,” said Joel Dodge, director of industrial policy and economic security at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.\n\nThe US Geological Survey designates 60 “critical minerals” vital to economic and national security.",

    "fullText": "Some billionaire CEOs and banking groups balked at President Donald Trump's proposed one-year 10% cap on credit card interest.\n\nIn an X post on Saturday, Noto wrote that the cap could encourage consumers to shift from credit cards to personal loans.\n\n\"If this is enacted—and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is—we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending. Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap,\" Noto wrote. \"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill.\"\n\nNoto wrote that personal loans could be an alternative for consumers looking to address debt.\n\n\"Also if this scenario plays out, underwriting discipline and borrower education become even more important,\" Noto wrote.\n\nTrump called for the cap in a Truth Social post on Friday, writing that his administration would \"no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies\" charging interest rates of 20% to 30% or more.\n\nEnacting the proposed cap would require an act of Congress. Additional details about the proposed cap haven't been released, but it has drawn concern from various corners of the financial world.\n\nBill Ackman, the billionaire CEO and founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, called the decision a \"mistake\" in a now-deleted X post on Friday.\n\n\"This is a mistake President,\" Ackman wrote. \"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid.\"\n\nAckman shared a separate X post on Saturday, writing that reducing credit card interest rates was a \"worthy and important\" goal, but still disagreed with the cap.\n\n\"My concern about capping rates at 10% is that doing so will inevitably cause millions of Americans to have their cards cancelled as credit card companies lose the ability to adequately price subprime credit risk,\" Ackman wrote. \"Consumers denied credit cards will be forced to turn to loan sharks whose rates and terms will be vastly worse for borrowers.\"\n\nSeveral banking associations — including the American Bankers Association and the Consumer Bankers Association — also criticized the proposed cap in a joint statement on Friday.\n\n\"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the statement said. \"We look forward to working with the administration to ensure Americans have access to the credit they need.\"",

    "fullText": "Republican Senator Rand Paul says President Donald Trump is shooting himself in the foot with his aggressive posturing towards Greenland.\n\nTrump has escalated his threats to take over the mineral-rich island, telling reporters Friday, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not.” The 79-year-old president said he would “do it the hard way” if he couldn’t strike a deal to acquire the territory.\n\nOn Sunday, Paul warned that Trump’s “denigrating” saber-rattling is backfiring by alienating GOP lawmakers in Washington and people in Greenland.\n\n“Let’s say you wanted to buy Greenland—and I’m not disputing that that might be something we might want,” the 63-year-old Kentucky senator said on ABC News’s This Week. “You don’t get there by angering and denigrating the people who live there and saying, ‘We’re going to march the Marines in and take it if you don’t sell it to us.’ It doesn’t make them very willing to sell to us.”\n\nPaul continued, “So really, if your goal is somehow we’re going to rattle the saber, then they’re going to sell it to us, I think it’s having the opposite effect. I think you’d be hard-pressed to find someone in Greenland for it, but you’d also be hard-pressed to find somebody in Washington who’s for a military invasion on either side of the aisle.”\n\nThe senator, one of the few Republicans who regularly challenges Trump, appears to be correct.\n\nGreenland’s party leaders issued a joint statement Friday night rejecting Trump in response to his latest assertions that the U.S. “needs” the island, a semi-autonomous territory within the Danish kingdom, and his refusal to rule out the use of military force.\n\n“We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people,” the statement said. “We would like to emphasize once again our wish that the United States’ contempt for our country ends.”\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has also rebuked Trump, reminding him that the U.S. has “no legal basis to annex” the territory.\n\nIn Congress, several GOP lawmakers, including Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, and Maine Senator Susan Collins, have openly condemned talk of the U.S. taking over Greenland.\n\nPaul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CBS Mornings last week that U.S. military action “won’t happen under my watch.”\n\n“I will do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland,” he said.\n\nABC News’s Martha Raddatz asked Paul on Sunday, “Do you actually think he would use military force, or are we overreacting to that?”\n\n“I would hope not,” Paul replied, reiterating his belief that Congress should decide if the military is deployed, whether in Greenland, Venezuela, or Colombia.\n\n“It’s about whether or not the people get a say in whether we go to war,” added the senator, who was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act last week. The resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nA White House official previously told the Daily Beast that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela.\n\nIn a Sunday press gaggle on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump which oil companies have made commitments to investments in Venezuela, and if Exxon has done so.\n\n\"I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out. I didn't like their response. They're playing too cute,\" Trump said to the reporter.\n\nHe said that he did not like Exxon's response to his $100 billion plan to invest in the Venezuelan oil industry. On Friday, Exxon's CEO, Darren Woods, told the president that he does not think Venezuela is currently ripe for investment.\n\n\"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela — today, it's uninvestable,\" Woods said in the meeting with Trump and oil executives at the White House.\n\nHe said that Exxon, which is based in Texas, has a long history in Venezuela, having operated in the country twice. He said the company has had its assets in Venezuela seized on both those occasions.\n\nWoods said that significant changes need to happen in the country to consider reentering, but he was confident the Trump administration could work with the Venezuelan government to implement those changes.\n\nHowever, other oil executives were more optimistic. Chevron's vice chairman, Mark Nelson, told Trump that the company plans to increase its current production with oil partners in Venezuela by 100% \"effective immediately.\"\n\nTrump's comments about Exxon come more than a week after US military forces launched a strike in Venezuela and captured the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. Maduro is being tried by a New York court for drug trafficking and weapons charges.\n\nExxon's stock price has remained largely flat after the bell on Friday. It's up more than 16% in the past year.",

    "description": "The investigation, which centers on renovations of the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, signals an escalation in the long-running clash between President Trump and the chair.",
    "fullText": "The U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia has opened a criminal investigation into Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, over the central bank’s renovation of its Washington headquarters and whether Mr. Powell lied to Congress about the scope of the project, according to officials briefed on the situation.\n\nThe inquiry, which includes an analysis of Mr. Powell’s public statements and an examination of spending records, was approved in November by Jeanine Pirro, a longtime ally of President Trump who was appointed to run the office last year, the officials said.\n\nThe investigation escalates Mr. Trump’s long-running feud with Mr. Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly. The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair — even though he nominated Mr. Powell for the position in 2017 — and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nMr. Trump told The New York Times in an interview last week that he had decided on who he wants to replace Mr. Powell as Fed chair. He is expected to soon announce his decision. Kevin A. Hassett, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, is a front-runner for the top job. While Mr. Powell’s term as chair ends in May, his term as a governor runs through January 2028. Mr. Powell has not disclosed whether he plans to stay on at the central bank beyond this year.\n\nIn a rare video message released by the Fed on Sunday, Mr. Powell described the investigation as “unprecedented” and questioned the motivation for the move, even as he affirmed that he carried out his duties as chair “without political fear or favor.”\n\n“This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,” he said. “It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.”\n\nHe warned that the investigation signaled a broader battle over the Fed’s independence. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\nA spokesman for Attorney General Pam Bondi did not comment on the investigation but said Ms. Bondi had “instructed her U.S. attorneys to prioritize investing any abuses of taxpayer dollars.”\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s investigation into Mr. Powell underscores Mr. Trump’s larger clash with the Fed. Other broadsides have included an effort to oust Lisa D. Cook, a governor at the central bank whom Mr. Trump tried to fire over allegations of mortgage fraud. Presidents are able to remove officials at the Fed only for “cause,” which has typically meant malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Supreme Court will hear arguments for Ms. Cook’s case on Jan. 21.\n\nCongress granted the Fed the authority to set interest rates free of meddling from presidents, whose political fortunes are often tethered to how the economy is faring. Rather, lawmakers stipulated that the central bank should pursue low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market.\n\nMr. Powell said on Sunday that the Justice Department had served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas. Prosecutors in Ms. Pirro’s office have contacted Mr. Powell’s staff multiple times to request documents about the renovation project, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation who discussed an open inquiry on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStarting an investigation is one thing, presenting sufficient evidence to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury — or making it stick — is another.\n\nIndictments against two of Mr. Trump’s top targets, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general, were thrown out in November by a federal judge. An investigation into Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, has yet to yield enough evidence to present to a grand jury.\n\nThe renovations at the center of the investigation into Mr. Powell broke ground in 2022 and are set to be completed in 2027. They are estimated to be about $700 million over budget. The project involves expanding and modernizing the Marriner S. Eccles Building and another building on Constitution Avenue, which date to the 1930s.\n\nThe Fed has said that neither of those buildings has been “comprehensively renovated” since their construction nearly 100 years ago, suggesting they were in need of a significant overhaul. Part of the project includes removing asbestos and lead contamination as well as making the facilities compliant with laws related to accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nA 2021 version of the Fed’s proposal described private elevators and dining rooms for top policymakers, water fountains and new marble features, in addition to a rooftop terrace for staff. Pressed at a congressional hearing in June, Mr. Powell denied that many of those features were part of the latest proposal.\n\n“There’s no V.I.P. dining room; there’s no new marble,” he said. “We took down the old marble, we’re putting it back up. We’ll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke. But there’s no special elevators. There’s just old elevators that have been there.”\n\nMr. Powell added that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some features that had been initially incorporated were scrapped.\n\nAfter Mr. Powell’s testimony, the Fed published a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on its website that reaffirmed Mr. Powell’s answers to lawmakers. The central bank continued to share additional details, including a virtual tour as well as photographs and annotations to the 2021 proposal that prompted the criticism.\n\nIn explaining the cost overruns, the central bank cited expenses tied to materials, equipment and labor as well as unforeseen circumstances, such as more asbestos than anticipated and soil contamination.",

Maduro has been indicted in the Southern District of New York on weapons and drug charges.\n\nOn Friday, American oil executives met with Trump and senior administration officials to discuss a proposed $100 billion plan to invest in Venezuela's oil operations.\n\nTrump earlier said the government may reimburse oil companies for growing their operations in Venezuela. The Big Oil executives at the meeting, for their part, appeared largely hesitant to reenter the volatile country before major reforms are made.\n\nFor Cuba, losing access to Venezuelan oil would be a big blow to its already uncertain economy. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Cuba imports the majority of its oil from Venezuela — about 30,000 to 35,000 barrels a day, per most estimates.\n\nSpeaking to reporters last week on board Air Force One, Trump said Cuba appeared \"ready to fall.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they're going to hold out,\" he said. \"But Cuba now has no income. They got all of their income from Venezuela, from the Venezuelan oil.\"\n\nAsked whether the US would take military action in Cuba, Trump said he did not think it would be necessary, adding: \"I think it's just going to fall.\"\n\nIn his post on Truth Social, Trump also positioned the US as Venezuela's protector moving forward, saying that most of the Cuban security personnel stationed in Caracas had been killed in the operation to seize Maduro.\n\nThe Cuban government announced that 32 of its nationals died during the US raid on the capital.",

    "description": "Hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle, an American oil company is attempting to extract billions of barrels of oil on Greenland, just as Trump is escalating tensions with the territory.",
    "fullText": "TASIILAQ, GREENLAND — Oil executives looking for the next massive source of petroleum have turned toward the Arctic for decades. Studies by the US government suggest the area above the Arctic Circle could hold as many as 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe oil alone would be enough to sustain the entirety of global demand for nearly three years if all other drilling worldwide were to cease tomorrow.\n\nAt the center of these ambitions is Greenland, where some of the harshest conditions on Earth protect stores that have drawn in prospectors looking for the chance at another discovery the size of Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay.\n\nA company called March GL, which will be renamed Greenland Energy Company after it goes public this year, is hoping to vault itself into the upper echelons of the industry by extracting some of these billions of barrels of oil from a peninsula called Jameson Land sticking off the eastern coast of Greenland, the largest island in the world. The oil could be transformative for the US and European markets likely to receive it, injecting a massive wave of new supply that could help wean Europe from its dependence on Russian petroleum, currently under a steep sanctions regime as its war in Ukraine rages on.\n\nIn late October, Yahoo Finance accompanied March GL CEO and veteran oilman Robert Price, alongside the company’s lead petroleum engineer, to a town called Tasiilaq on Greenland’s eastern coast, where March GL’s contractors were preparing to store a collection of heavy machinery in town for the winter.\n\nPrice had been planning to barge the earthmovers up to Jameson Land, where they would begin constructing a three-mile-long road from the coast to the inland site where March GL will be drilling its first wells. Rough seas off the island’s eastern coast left the tugboat with which the company planned to haul the equipment unable to make the journey; by late autumn, the window of ice-free water to make this trip was closing too quickly to wait for a new one.\n\nInstead, March GL’s team will keep much of its equipment in Tasiilaq until the spring or summer, when the ice will thaw, compressing their timelines — a testament to the tenuous-at-best operating conditions in Greenland.\n\nSince that trip, the complexities of Price’s Greenland ambitions have only increased.\n\nAfter the arrest and extraction of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, President Trump renewed his push to annex the Danish autonomous territory. Trump said during a press briefing on Jan. 4 that “we need Greenland” to protect US national security interests in the Arctic, comments which set off a wave of pushback from the Greenlandic and Danish governments.",

    "description": "U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA/HOUSTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said no more Venezuelan oil or money will go to Cuba and suggested the Communist-run island should strike a deal with Washington, ramping up pressure on the long-time U.S. nemesis and provoking defiant words from the island's leadership.\n\nVenezuela is ​Cuba's biggest oil supplier, but no cargoes have departed from Venezuelan ports to the Caribbean country since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces ‌in early January amid a strict U.S. oil blockade on the OPEC country, shipping data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Caracas and Washington are progressing on a $2 billion deal to supply up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. with ‌proceeds to be deposited in U.S. Treasury-supervised accounts, a major test of the emerging relationship between Trump and interim President Delcy Rodriguez.\n\n\"THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.\n\n\"Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela,\" Trump added.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel rejected Trump's threat on social media, suggesting the U.S. had no moral authority to force a deal on Cuba.\n\n\"Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Nobody dictates what ⁠we do,\" Diaz-Canel said on X. \"Cuba does not attack; it has ‌been attacked by the U.S. for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.\"\n\nThe U.S. president did not elaborate on his suggested deal.\n\nBut Trump's push on Cuba represents the latest escalation in his move to bring regional ‍powers in line with the United States and underscores the seriousness of the administration's ambition to dominate the Western Hemisphere.\n\nTrump's top officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have made no secret of their expectation that the recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela could push Cuba over the edge.\n\nU.S. officials have hardened their rhetoric against Cuba in recent weeks, though the two countries have been at odds since former leader Fidel Castro's ​1959 revolution.\n\nCuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said in another post on X on Sunday that Cuba had the right to import fuel from any suppliers willing to ‌export it. He also denied that Cuba had received financial or other \"material\" compensation in return for security services provided to any country.\n\nThirty-two members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence services were killed during the U.S. raid on Venezuela. Cuba said those killed were responsible for \"security and defense\" but did not provide details on the arrangement between the two long-time allies.\n\nCuba relies on imported crude and fuel mainly provided by Venezuela, and Mexico in smaller volumes, purchased on the open market to keep its power generators and vehicles running.\n\nAs its operational refining capacity dwindled in recent years, Venezuela's supply of crude and fuel to Cuba has fallen. But the South American country is still the largest provider with some 26,500 barrels per day exported last year, according to ship ⁠tracking data and internal documents of state-run PDVSA, which covered roughly 50% of Cuba's oil deficit.\n\nEven before Maduro's ​capture, Cuba had been struggling to keep the lights on. Vast swaths of the island live without electricity for ​much of the day, and even the capital Havana has seen its economy crippled by hours-long rolling blackouts.\n\nShortages of food, fuel and medicine have put Cubans on edge and have prompted a record-breaking exodus, primarily to the United States, in the past five years.\n\nMexico has emerged in recent ‍weeks as a critical alternative oil supplier to ⁠the island, but the supply remains small, according to the shipping data.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum last week said her country had not increased supply volumes, but given recent political events in Venezuela, Mexico had turned into an \"important supplier\" of crude to Cuba.\n\nU.S. intelligence has painted a grim picture of Cuba's economic and political situation, but its assessments offer ⁠no clear support for Trump's prediction that the island is \"ready to fall,\" Reuters reported on Saturday, citing three people familiar with the confidential assessments.\n\nThe CIA's view is that key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as agriculture and ‌tourism, are severely strained by frequent blackouts, trade sanctions and other problems. The potential loss of oil imports and other support from Venezuela could make governing ‌more difficult for Diaz-Canel.",

    "title": "We heard from over 400 student-loan borrowers. Here's what's on their minds, from repayment to relief.",
    "description": "Since December 5, over 400 student-loan borrowers have shared their stories while gearing up for Trump's major repayment overhaul this year.",
    "fullText": "\"I got student-loan forgiveness!\"\n\n\"I'm working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nIn one month, over 400 student-loan borrowers shared their experiences of repayment and relief with me in a brief survey.\n\nEach story was unique and touched on a range of themes, which will feed more in-depth stories on respondents' experiences throughout the year.\n\nAs 2026 shapes up to be a year of turmoil for student-loan borrowers due to President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul, I wanted to start by looking broadly at the main concerns on the minds of those who reached out.\n\nSome borrowers told me that they achieved student-loan forgiveness or repaid their loans in full. However, the majority of respondents reported a range of concerns about the future of their balances, including worries about losing a key affordable repayment plan, struggling to get help from their servicers, being in default on their loans, and more.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation includes the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two less generous options. It also eliminates the SAVE plan, which promised affordable monthly payments with a shorter timeline to debt relief. Nearly half of the survey's respondents said they're enrolled in SAVE.\n\nIf you're interested in sharing your student-loan story and having it highlighted in future coverage, fill out the survey here, and I'll be in touch. Here are some of the main themes that student-loan borrowers have shared so far.\n\nOn December 9, the Department of Education announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri to officially end the SAVE student-loan repayment plan, established by former President Joe Biden. A court has not yet approved the settlement. However, upon approval, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in SAVE, deny pending applications, and move all enrolled borrowers to existing repayment plans.\n\nWhile the department intended to eliminate SAVE by 2028, the settlement accelerates the timeline and would push the 7 million enrolled borrowers into new repayment plans with higher payments sooner than anticipated. Some borrowers in the survey described SAVE as a lifeline for them, and they expressed concerns about their ability to afford higher monthly payments on a new plan.\n\n\"I'm bracing for an astronomical bill,\" Brenda McCoy, a 60-year-old borrower on SAVE, told me.\n\nSome survey respondents said that they had their balances wiped out through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nOver 60 respondents said that they're pursuing PSLF, and while they're at different stages, the majority said that they're concerned about the future of the program. Trump's Department of Education finalized a rule to limit eligibility for PSLF following a March executive order that directed the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nThe new rule, set to go into effect in July, would exclude employers from PSLF who the department determines to have engaged in \"illegal activities\" that do not align with the administration's views.\n\nRespondents who are pursuing PSLF described feeling like a \"pawn\" and being \"held hostage\" due to the program's uncertainty.\n\nThe consequences of default are also weighing on some borrowers' minds. Beginning January 7, the Department of Education said it would start notifying about 1,000 borrowers in default that their wages will be garnished. It follows the resumption of collections on defaulted student loans in May 2025 after a five-year pause.\n\nOver 5 million borrowers are in default, which typically occurs after a federal borrower hasn't made payments in more than 270 days. Some borrowers in default said they're expecting wage garnishment notices, while those who are not yet in default but are concerned about affording payments said they're worried garnishments are in their future.\n\nBorrowers in default described feeling \"depressed\" and \"anxious\" due to their repayment statuses.\n\nParent PLUS loans allow parents to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their kids' education. It's also facing changes in Trump's spending legislation: the department is planning to impose a $65,000 lifetime borrowing limit per dependent student, which would limit parents' ability to help finance their kids' college experiences.\n\nSome Parent PLUS borrowers said they've been struggling with repayment long before Trump's proposed changes. For example, some are struggling to pay back the loans years after their kids graduated while balancing their own debt and expenses.\n\nParent borrowers described paying more than what they borrowed, with some saying taking out the loans was a \"mistake.\"\n\nIn addition to facing the changing federal student-loan landscape, some survey respondents reported balancing both federal and private student loans. Private student loans often have higher interest rates, and they're not eligible for federal relief programs, such as PSLF.\n\nHowever, some borrowers turn to the private lending market for additional financing, and the Department of Education's new proposed caps on borrowing could lead more borrowers to turn to private student loans to help pay for programs that federal aid would no longer cover.",

    "fullText": "Some in the Trump administration are reportedly concerned with the speed at which officials claimed “domestic terrorism” in the aftermath of the ICE-involved shooting death of Minnesota mom Renee Good.\n\nGood was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who captured the incident on his own phone as he let off three rounds after Good refused to exit her van.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem immediately accused Good of “domestic terrorism” for trying to “ram them with her vehicle.”\n\nVice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump all repeated Noem’s talking points, with Vance accusing the media of lying about the incident.\n\nPolitico reported Friday that “even supporters of the president” are afraid the aggressive approach “risks undermining public confidence in the ongoing investigation.”\n\nOne person close to the administration told Politico, “Do I think it’s domestic terrorism? Yeah, I do. But it might not have been wise to say that at the outset, how [Noem] said it.”\n\nAnother administration official concerned about the incident widening the political divide told Politico, “I don’t know how we recover from this.”\n\nThey continued, “This is highly problematic and not a good look and not something our government should be remotely engaged in.”\n\nVideos of the shooting incident have been circulating on social media, and some pundits have called them a “Rorschach test” for conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn Friday, Vance posted a new video angle that he claimed vindicated the officer for firing in self-defense, but liberals noted Good’s demeanor and words to the agent — “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you” — before she appears to turn the steering wheel away from the agent in an apparent attempt to leave the scene.\n\nDHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin commented on the video Vance posted, telling Politico, “If you weaponize a vehicle, a deadly weapon to kill or cause bodily harm to a federal law enforcement officer, that is an act of domestic terrorism and will be prosecuted as such.”\n\nPresident Trump said Friday that he supported the FBI’s unusual move to block state officials from investigating the incident because Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) is “a stupid person.”\n\nThe post ‘I Don’t Know How We Recover From This’: Trump Officials Reportedly Worried About Quick Claims of ‘Domestic Terrorism’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Lopatto, writing at The Verge, “Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai Are Cowards”:\n\nSince X’s users started using Grok to undress women and\nchildren using deepfake images, I have been waiting for\nwhat I assumed would be inevitable: X getting booted from Apple’s\nand Google’s app stores. The fact that it hasn’t happened yet\ntells me something serious about Silicon Valley’s leadership: Tim\nCook and Sundar Pichai are spineless cowards who are terrified of\nElon Musk.\n\nLopatto’s outrage and righteous anger are justified, but I think mostly misdirected. Apple and Google — and thus, Cook and Pichai, as the men who sit behind the desks where the buck stops at both companies — are culpable. But this is ultimately not about them, and not about Musk. It’s Trump, as president, they fear. Not Musk. And they are correct to fear Trump.\n\nYear one of Trump 2.0 has crystallized what had become — after decades of deliberate restraint after World War II, and even more so after the end of the Cold War — overlooked. The Presidency of the United States bestows upon its officeholder enormous, unparalleled, power. No one was afraid of Trump after he lost to Joe Biden in 2020. The man was convicted of 34 felonies in a cold New York City courtroom in May 2024, a mere 19 months ago. Trump expected and asked for riots outside the courtroom. He got nothing but pathetic support from a handful of kooks. A year earlier, he lost a humiliating sexual assault civil lawsuit to E. Jean Carroll. Trump, just a year and a half ago, was a buffoon getting his mug shot taken. Today he’s arguing that his power is unchecked by anything other than his own sense of morality.\n\nNo other president has ever abused (or, if you support him, wielded) the powers of the office like Trump has. The power and influence of Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, CEOs of two of the top five companies in the world, isn’t merely superseded by Trump’s power and influence as president. Their power and influence are dwarfed by Trump’s. Any credible argument about how they should act must acknowledge that profound imbalance.\n\nI never want to hear any moral grandstanding from these boys ever\nagain. The next time Tim Cook says “privacy is a human\nright,” the only possible response is to laugh in his face.\nI mean, Apple and Google are fine distributing an app that has\ncreated an undressed image Grok made of Renee Nicole Good,\nthe mother who was shot by ICE in Minneapolis. How do you plan\nto defend getting rid of the ICEBlock app while allowing X\nto generate degrading images of a woman ICE killed? Can Apple and\nGoogle even identify their values beyond their commitment to\n“shareholder value”? What’s your fucking endgame here, guys?\n\nThe profound power imbalance here is frustrating. But also terrifying. It’s folly to think these CEOs should steer their companies into direct confrontation with Trump. It would do no ultimate good for Apple or Google to burn themselves to the ground in protest. These men aren’t beholden to shareholders, per se. They’re doing their duty to institutions they’ve devoted their lives to. Companies that are worth preserving and protecting. Perhaps not in your estimation, but certainly from theirs.\n\nBut abject obsequiousness — which more and more seems the path Cook and Pichai are choosing — is no more justifiable a response than corporate suicide. The situation is not binary: acquiescence or war. There is a broad middle ground, founded on principle.\n\nDisney’s response to the Jimmy Kimmel controversy a few months ago shows the way. Defend the company’s principles while simultaneously defending the company from Trump’s demented wrath. You can take the position of “Fuck you, make me” without ever saying those words. Objection is not confrontation. Do the right thing and enforce the App Store and Play Store guidelines, and remove X and Grok from the stores. Make Musk object. Make the Trump administration object. Make them defend the indefensible — in public. Make clear why the apps were removed from the app stores and force Musk — and Trump, if he chooses — to argue that those things are A-OK by them. In court.\n\nThe judicious path for Apple and Google (and every other U.S. company) may well be to obey the law, even when the law is being actively corrupted. But the correct path is not to obey in advance. Stand behind the law while the law still exists on your side. Disney resisted Trump’s preposterous demand that they fire Jimmy Kimmel without lasting controversy, simply by standing firm in their conviction. Apple and Google could certainly do the same regarding apps that are being used to generate CSAM and deepfake harassment, regardless if the apps are part of the private fiefdom of Trump’s ally Elon Musk. It’s wise for Cook and Pichai to pick their battles. This one, I think, is worth picking. This is a moment when the App Store and Play Store can stand firmly on the side of longstanding and correct societal norms.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump laid into Republican Senator Susan Collins in an expletive-laden phone call after she voted against one of his top priorities.\n\nThe president reportedly made a “profanity-laced” call to the vulnerable Republican senator on Thursday, sources told The Hill. Collins was one of five GOP senators to join Democrats in advancing a resolution on the War Powers Act from committee to the floor, which passed in a 52-47 vote earlier in the day.\n\n“He was very mad about the vote,” the source told The Hill. “Very mad. Very hot.”\n\nThe resolution would block the president’s ability to use military force against Venezuela following the U.S. capture of the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. This throws a wrench in Trump’s plans to seize Venezuela’s oil.\n\nThe source told The Hill that the president “basically read her the riot act,” in a phone call that came “out of the blue.” Collins’ office confirmed to The Hill that the call took place, but did not include any additional details on what the president said. The Daily Beast reached out to the senator’s representatives and the White House for comment.\n\nIn addition to Collins, Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young also voted to advance the war powers resolution. The move made Trump irate. He posted at length about the five conservative lawmakers on his social media platform, Truth Social.\n\n“Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,” Trump wrote. “Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Josh Hawley, and Todd Young should never be elected to office again.”\n\nCollins is up for reelection this year and faces a tight race as Democratic challengers gain in popularity. Her seat will be important for Republicans to maintain control of the Senate after the midterms. However, Trump has been a thorn in his party’s side, openly expressing his desire to see Collins out. This latest call appears to reaffirm his animosity toward the senator.\n\n“The president obviously is unhappy with the vote,” Collins told reporters following Trump’s ire. “I guess this means that he would prefer to have Gov. Mills or somebody else with whom he’s not had a great relationship. I don’t know, I’m just not going to comment.”\n\nThe president has faced pressure and criticism following the operation in Venezuela that ended in Maduro’s capture. While Maduro sits in custody awaiting trial, Trump has announced plans for the U.S. to “run” Venezuela and sell millions of barrels of its oil.\n\nTrump met with major oil executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon on Friday to discuss Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. However, the president, 79, quickly veered off-topic, pausing the meeting to wax poetic about the White House ballroom currently under construction.",

After all, it’s turning out to be a once-in-a-lifetime event full of incredible spectacles, UFC champions, and world-class guests.\n\nThe event is expected to garner such attention and attract dignitaries from around the world that France isn’t willing to go head-to-head with UFC on Trump’s birthday. Can you blame them?\n\n🚨 France is delaying this year’s G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event on June 14 👀\n\n(via @politico) pic.twitter.com/0XXqSHM8IS\n\n— Championship Rounds (@ChampRDS) January 9, 2026\n\nAccording to a recent report by news outlet Politico, France will move its annual G7 Summit — which seven major industrial countries discuss key global policy issues — from June 14-16 to June 15-17. This clears the way for UFC’s White House card and Trump’s birthday bash on June 14. French President Emmanuel Macron’s office declined to confirm that the rescheduling is directly related to the UFC event and said the change of date is “the result of our consultations with G7 partners.”\n\nWhen asked about the G7 Summit delay a White House official told Politico: “As the leader of the free world, our partners believed that President Trump’s attendance at the G7 Summit was essential. They kindly shifted dates to accommodate the U.S. president’s schedule.”\n\nDana White reshares the news that France has delayed the 2026 G7 summit to avoid a scheduling conflict with the UFC White House event. 😅 pic.twitter.com/xKiSKRSgx3\n\n— MMA Orbit (@mma_orbit) January 9, 2026\n\nFor more UFC White House 2026 news and coverage click HERE.",

    "fullText": "Bill Ackman did not mince words when giving his opinion of President Donald Trump's call for a temporary cap on credit card rates.\n\nIn a since-deleted X post, the hedge fund billionaire said late on Friday that Trump's call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year was a \"mistake\" that could lead to millions having their cards canceled.\n\n\"This is a mistake President,\" Ackman wrote. \"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid.\"\n\nTrump had taken to Truth Social earlier on Friday in a fresh effort to address the hot political issue of \"affordability,\" saying his administration intended to target lenders charging interest rates of \"20 to 30%.\"\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off,'\" he said. \"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%.\"\n\nSuch a cap would likely require authorization by Congress. It is unclear what moves the president could make to bypass this.\n\nIn a new post on Saturday, Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, said Trump's \"goal of reducing credit card interest rates\" was a \"worthy and important one,\" but he reiterated his concerns over a 10% cap.\n\n\"I have no investments in the credit card space so I am not the expert, but the market for credit cards appears highly competitive,\" Ackman continued. \"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies.\"\n\nTrump, who pledged to \"immediately bring prices down\" in office, has recently honed in on the topic of affordability.\n\nNew York City mayor Zohran Mamdani swept to victory in November after running a campaign focused on voters' cost-of-living concerns.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "Following the publication of a report in The New York Times on Friday night revealing that the Washington National Opera will be leaving the Kennedy Center, members of the Trump administration immediately began scrambling to reframe the news as not only a positive, but their idea.\n\nKennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi, who has been hard at work lashing out at artists for canceling scheduled performances at the once-revered venue, posted a statement to X claiming that the center’s relationship with the opera group has “presented ongoing financial challenges for well over a decade” that “long predate the current leadership.”\n\n“Given the longstanding financial strain, it has become necessary for us to part ways to protect the best interests of the Center,” Daravi wrote.\n\nThe statement was then amplified by the venue’s Donald Trump-appointed executive director Richard Grenell, who elaborated on the difficulties surrounding exclusivity agreements.\n\n“Having an exclusive relationship has been extremely expensive and limiting in choice and variety,” Grenell wrote on X. “We approached the Opera leadership last year with this idea and they began to be open to it.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, he wrote, “The exclusive Opera contract cost the Trump Kennedy Center $64 million over the last 10 years—with their expenses being double their revenues.”\n\n“We were very pleased that the current Opera leadership was so willing to end their exclusivity,” he noted.\n\nThe New York Times report states that the decision to sever ties was made by the Washington National Opera, with the board of trustees approving a resolution on Friday that will enable the group to terminate its agreement with the venue.\n\n“Today, the Washington National Opera announced its decision to seek an amicable early termination of its affiliation agreement with the Kennedy Center and resume operations as a fully independent nonprofit entity,” a statement provided to The New York Times said.\n\nOpera officials told the paper that new venues in Washington D.C. have been lined up but that no leases have been signed. They declined to name specific venues.\n\nWith the passing of the resolution, the WNO will now seek to move its performances out of the center’s opera house and reduce the number of performances staged there.\n\nThe decision marks the end of a partnership between the Kennedy Center and the WNO that dates back to 1971.\n\nWhile the WNO did not mention the Kennedy Center’s MAGA rebrand as the reason for its departure, they have noted disagreements with new requirements that have been made under the cultural center’s new management.\n\nSeveral well-known performers have canceled planned events since President Donald Trump’s takeover of the center, which saw him fire the board in order to populate it with his allies and install himself as chair.\n\nTrump further ignited tensions when he attempted to rebrand the center to bear his name, ignoring the fact that any formal change requires congressional action. A lawsuit was filed shortly after, challenging the rebrand.\n\nIn response to Trump’s actions, several artists have canceled planned appearances at the performing arts venue, including comedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, and Grammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck.\n\nOn Thursday, singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos canceled her Feb. 7 performance at the Kennedy Center, citing her Mexican heritage and the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the reasons behind her decision.\n\n“As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,” the Grammy-nominated musician wrote on Thursday. “Unfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.”",

The titles of recent videos include Dearborn Michigan has Fallen… Christians and Muslims Battle, Portland has Fallen… ANTIFA has Taken Control of City, and I Confronted Dangerous Migrant Scammers in NYC | Canal Street, the latter of which highlights a physical confrontation between Shirley and a street vendor in New York.\n\nShirley’s 26 December video, which targeted Minnesota’s Somali community with allegations of widespread fraud, became the basis for a torrent of anti-immigrant and anti-Somali content across social media, including in Truth Social posts by Donald Trump.\n\nFollow-up reporting by local outlets including CBS Minnesota and the Minnesota Star-Tribune, has found little factual basis for Shirley’s claims that daycare centers were claiming federal funding without caring for any children.\n\nMore than 90 people in Minnesota have been charged since 2022 in a $250m Covid-19 relief fraud scheme involving a non-profit that falsely claimed to provide meals to children, and a federal prosecutor estimated that $9bn or \n\nBut no fraud charges have been filed against the daycare centers featured by Shirley, though state records show some had code violations unrelated to fraud\n\nShirley’s latest video was the culmination of a years-long, peripatetic effort by the mother-and-son pairing to entrench themselves at the head of a burgeoning milieu of Maga-verse content creators.\n\nBrooke Shirley, 55, has posted hundreds of videos to her TikTok account beginning just two weeks after the January 6 protests at the United States Capitol, which Nick Shirley filmed himself attending.\n\nShe has also publicly defended the veracity of her son’s work. In November she told the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR) that “what Nick is doing is journalism”, adding: “He’s documenting what is going on in America and in the world. And independent journalists are the ones that are out there.”\n\nThey also have a shared self-perception as truth-telling citizen journalists.\n\nThe Guardian contacted Brooke Shirley for comment via voice and text message on a cellphone number identified as an active connection in her name by several data brokers. Nick Shirley was contacted for comment via the contact email listed on his YouTube page, and which he has invited people to send tips on in the description field of his videos.\n\nPetros Iosifidos, professor of media and communications policy at City St George’s, University of London, and the co-author of the 2021 book Digital Democracy, Social Media and Disinformation, said: “Such a usage of social media does not aid democratic representation and instead contributes to a greater destabilisation of modern politics.\n\nHe added, “The situation has worsened in more recent years with widespread mis/disinformation that deprives the public of their fundamental right to have access to reliable, accurate information so to make informed decisions.”\n\nNick Shirley has emerged in the last two years as one of a new crop of news influencers who achieved a new level of salience at the tail end of the Biden years and have been actively cultivated by Trump’s White House.\n\nShirley was one of the invitees to a White House Antifa roundtable in October, at which influencers and administration officials aired their grievances about the amorphous social movement that has served as a Maga target since Trump’s first presidency.\n\nShirley dutifully posted a video of his speech at the event on his YouTube channel.\n\nReportedly, the attention from Shirley and other news influencers such as Savanah Hernandez led to an Ice sweep of the vendors, which was met by resistance from New York residents, and earned a rebuke from Zohran Mamdani, then a mayoral candidate, who called the tactics “aggressive and reckless”.\n\nOne media report quoted a resident of the Chinatown district where the vendors have been located for decades as saying that Ice “just take advantage of this because suddenly the rightwing media and online influencers came down into the area”.\n\nIn November, Shirley was awarded the “citizen journalist of the year” at the Citizen Journalism Gala held at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, and hosted by James O’Keefe.\n\nThe month after the Mar-a-Lago ceremony, Shirley was collaborating with Minnesota Republicans to put the issue of purported fraud in the state’s Somali immigrant community on the national agenda.\n\nOn 29 December, House Republican leaders held a press conference in the wake of his videos.\n\nAt that conference, Lisa DeMuth not only backed the veracity of the video, telling reporters: “By now, everyone has seen the viral video that in under an hour exposed more than a million dollars in fraud.”\n\nShe also added: “Our caucus has been working to expose fraud for years, including working with Nick Shirley and agency whistleblowers to get the information out to the public and to hold the Walz administration accountable.”\n\nThe Guardian emailed DeMuth to ask for specifics on the collaboration, and whether the apparent inaccuracies unveiled by subsequent reporting were Shirley’s alone, or as a result of information provided by the caucus.\n\nA spokesperson referred to a man who appears prominently in the video, referred to only as “David” by Shirley, but who was later identified by the Minnesota Star-Tribune as David Hoch, a Minnesotan whose several paid political campaigns included an incident in which he campaigned “in nothing but shorts and a sandwich board on Minneapolis’ Nicollet Mall”.\n\nThey wrote: “Some of the information they used, including daycare locations, CCAP numbers, violations, etc, was given to David by caucus staff who found it in the official DHS licensing database and other publicly available sources.”\n\nShirley reportedly built his channel with shock and prank videos in the late teens, while he was still a high school student. After graduating in 2020, Shirley, a Mormon, took a hiatus during 2021 and 2022 while he completed a religiously ordained mission.\n\nAfter he returned from his mission in 2023, according to NPR, Shirley’s content took on a more sharply political and partisan character.\n\nPer Columbia Journalism Review reporting, this pivot was encouraged by Brooke: “It was Brooke – who was a former journalism student and a content creator herself – who pushed her son to cover the southern border,” the topic of several Nick Shirley videos in 2023.\n\nBrooke Shirley not only encouraged her son to make such content, but arguably led the way for him, having published pro-Maga content to TikTok since late January 2021, according to a Guardian review of the account.\n\nShe has also been closely involved in his work. In his acceptance speech at Mar-a-Lago, according to CJR, he thanked Brooke “for filming many of his videos”.\n\nEach has registered companies that appear to be related to their public output.\n\nAccording to Utah company records, Shirley was the organizer of Honey Badger LLC, whose purpose was “online media and related activities”, which was registered in April 2024 and administratively dissolved on 21 September 2025. Brooke Shirley, meanwhile, is the organizer of BT Outlook LLC, whose purpose is “social media and related activities”, which was incorporated on 30 September 2024.\n\nBoth companies were registered at the same residential address in suburban Farmington, Utah. It’s not known if BT Outlook LLC is the underlying entity for the pair’s news influencer activities.\n\nWhile Nick Shirley promotes his YouTube channel as being “here to entertain and bring the truth to all”, on Brooke’s TikTok account, which at the time of reporting had more than 290,000 followers, Brooke describes herself as a “boots on the ground Citizen Journalist!”, adding, “follow me for true news!”.\n\nBrooke’s boots frequently tread the same ground as Nick’s.\n\nThe pair’s video output indicates that they travel to the same places that have been the focus of conservative media and social media, and produce often-inflammatory content that reinforces conspiracy narratives about locales, individuals and groups that have been demonized in rightwing discourse.\n\nNick Shirley’s videos are usually longer, more complex, and more intensively edited than his mother’s, but the pair often cover the same ground.\n\nOn 28 October, for example, Nick Shirley published a video on YouTube which purported to offer an account of events on the ground in Portland, Oregon. His video played up stereotypes of the city which have emerged during the Trump era, focusing on homeless encampments, and scuffles outside the city’s ICE facility, which has been a focus for protesters and counter-protesters since the summer, and attracted a Trump-ordered national guard deployment, which has since ended after the supreme court judged it unconstitutional.\n\nIn a section of the video Shirley entitled “ANTIFA receives a new shipment”, Shirley showed a U-Haul truck resupplying protesters with barbecue ingredients and inflatable animal costumes.\n\nBetween 12 and 16 October, Brooke Shirley published five TikTok videos shot in the city. In one published on 17 October, Shirley features footage of the same costumes, groceries and charcoal grills highlighted by Nick in his longer YouTube video.\n\nIn the video, which features throughout a text insert reading “Antifa camp receives gear in Portland”, Brooke Shirley intones over footage of the set-up outside the ICE facility: “I’m in Portland, Oregon, and I’m going to show you what the ICE facility looks like,” adding: “Right over there you can get inflatables to put on. There’s food to eat. There’s tents to take a nap in, I guess.”\n\nAnother of Brooke Shirley’s Portland videos published on 15 October is focused on protesters wearing Tyrannosaurus rex costumes.\n\nIn that video, over footage of the blow-up theropods dancing with other protesters, Shirley asked viewers to “imagine if for 100 days this has been going on in front of your apartment complex. Because this has been going on for more than 100 days, 24/7”.\n\nThe same pattern repeats itself in the pair’s trips throughout the US and beyond to cover hot-button rightwing issues and events.\n\nOn 15 September, Nick Shirley posted video taken at the anti-immigrant Unite the Kingdom rally in London held two days earlier, where interviewees included a woman in a Union Jack bikini, and a man with severe facial contusions who was later seen confronting police officers.\n\nThe video also heavily featured the far-right activist and convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, who was one of the rally’s key organizers.\n\nShirley published a separate sit-down interview with Robinson.\n\nAround the rally, Brooke Shirley published interviews with attenders who offered praise for Donald Trump and the recently assassinated Charlie Kirk. The previous year, on a separate trip, Brooke Shirley published her own interview with Tommy Robinson.\n\nFollowing established practice, Brooke Shirley posted versions of the Minnesota story to her TikTok channel.\n\nOn 27 December, she posted a video captioned “The Somalians are masters at fraud and the government is dumb enough to allow it to continue to go on it. It’s easy to find the fraud. All you need to do is a little bit of research and visit the businesses. #minnesota #minneapolis”.\n\nA text insert on the video, which shows Brooke Shirley standing outside a purportedly empty ABC Learning daycare center in Minneapolis, reads: “Somalian-run Daycares all over Minnesota are closed yet collecting millions every year from the government.”\n\nIn the video, Brooke Shirley says: “This daycare right here, ran by Somalians, has taken in from the Minnesota government $1.1m.”\n\nShirley adds: “This daycare says it can hold up to 40 children. I went up to the door. The door is locked, and as you can see, the windows are blacked out. I can’t hear any children inside this daycare.”\n\nShirley continues: “It’s midday right now. You’d think there’d be children in there playing, being taught, but no one is in there.”\n\nFurther on, she asserts: “The Somalians are robbing the taxpayers in Minnesota blind.”\n\nNick Shirley’s identical claims about ABC Learning Center have been refuted by multiple outlets, including CBS Minnesota, who found timestamped security footage of children arriving on the day they visited the facility, with reporters seeing children being cared for when they visited.\n\nBrooke Shirley’s video had been viewed almost 360,000 times at the time of reporting.\n\nIn the past, Brooke Shirley has credited her son for her success on TikTok.\n\nOn 18 January 2025, following a brief TikTok shutdown arising from Biden-era legislation aimed at forcing the site’s Chinese parent company to divest, Shirley posted a video whose caption explicitly credited her son for her success on the platform.\n\n“I am saying goodbye for a moment hopefully we will be back! Thank you my TikTok family and friends!” Shirley wrote, adding “Thank you to my amazing son @Nick Shirley for making my dreams come true here on TikTok!!”\n\nThe accompanying video, soundtracked by Green Day’s Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), featured a montage of still images of Shirley interviewing migrants at the southern border and cities around the country, attending Trump rallies and student protests, and standing outside homeless encampments.\n\nDespite persistent concerns about the quality of the information passed on by self-described “citizen journalists” like Shirley, Pew research suggests that one in five Americans regularly get news from social media content creators.",

    "fullText": "US President Donald Trump announced Thursday that American forces would begin ground operations in Mexico targeting drug cartels, following months of naval strikes in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean.\n\n\"We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,\" Trump said in an interview with broadcaster Sean Hannity on Fox News.\n\nTrump provided no additional information on the timing or scope of the planned land attacks.\n\nAny military strikes on Mexican territory without Mexico City's consent would violate international law and mark an unprecedented attack on a US ally and major trading partner.\n\nThe statement follows Saturday's Delta Forces-led capture of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro at a Caracas compound where he was sheltering, the culmination of an extended US military and economic campaign against his government. Maduro now faces drug trafficking charges in New York.\n\nUS strikes on narcoboats have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people since September, according to US officials. Trump has also recently revealed that US forces struck a docking facility for such boats in Venezuela.\n\nThe naval campaign has targeted vessels suspected of smuggling cocaine and fentanyl in international waters and near Venezuela's coast. Trump has described the operations as enforcing a blockade on drug trafficking.\n\nGround strikes on cartels in Mexico would represent a substantial expansion of US military involvement in the region.\n\nMexico's two most powerful criminal organisations, the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel, control vast territories and have been locked in violent competition that killed more than 30,000 people last year.\n\nTrump designated six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organisations in February 2025, a move Mexico condemned as threatening its sovereignty and potentially justifying military intervention.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has proposed constitutional reforms to strengthen protections against unauthorised foreign operations and has consistently rejected any US military presence on Mexican soil.\n\nSheinbaum said Monday that the Americas \"do not belong\" to any single nation, responding to Trump's assertion of Washington's \"dominance\" over the hemisphere after Maduro's capture.\n\nTrump said Sunday he has pressed Sheinbaum to allow deployment of US troops against Mexican cartels, an offer he said she previously rejected.\n\nOverdoses from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids have caused more than 100,000 deaths in the US per year since 2021. Mexican cartels produce most of the fentanyl entering the US using chemical precursors sourced primarily from China.\n\nTrump designated the drug as a weapon of mass destruction in December 2025.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Trump would seek Congressional authorisation for strikes in Mexico. The US constitution grants Congress authority to declare war, although presidents have historically launched military operations without formal declarations.",

    "title": "Why Is Greenland Part of the Kingdom of Denmark? A Short History",
    "description": "From the Vikings to Trump: Greenland’s historic development negates recent White House territorial demands.",
    "fullText": "The first Nordic presence in Greenland dates back to Erik the Red, a Norse Viking banished from Iceland for manslaughter, who sought a new future in Greenland around the end of the 10th century. The name “Greenland” referred to the vegetation around Southern Greenland’s fjords, but the name was likely also given in an attempt to lure more Norse settlers to Erik’s settlement in Southeast Greenland. The Norse settlements in Greenland became part of a North Atlantic empire ruled from Norway.\n\nThe Norse stayed in Greenland for centuries. At the start of the 15th century, they disappeared with little trace. There are numerous possible reasons, including: a colder climate that made the island less habitable and conflict with the Inuit, who began to arrive in the areas that were populated by the Norse.\n\nIn 1721, Hans Egede, a Norwegian priest and missionary with support from the united Dano-Norwegian crown, reestablished contact with Greenland. A concern at the time was that the Norse settlers had missed the Reformation and were still Catholics. When Hans Egede arrived, however, he found only the Inuit, by then firmly established in most of Greenland, and he decided to focus his efforts on converting them to Christianity.\n\nThat marked the beginning of the colonial period. It was a slow start, and Norwegian-Danish influence in Greenland had to compete with other foreign powers, notably the Dutch. In a process that spanned generations, the Inuit were converted to Christianity, and Greenland was both politically and economically tied to Denmark-Norway in a colonial relationship.\n\nWhen the monarchy of Denmark and Norway broke apart in 1814, Denmark kept Greenland. Danish-Greenlandic colonial relations in the 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by a Danish paternalistic policy for cautious development, ensuring that Greenland would be a profitable colony. In 1916, Denmark’s rights to Greenland were confirmed by the United States, as part of a deal that facilitated the American purchase of the Danish West Indies. A controversy concerning a Norwegian claim to parts of Greenland ended in 1933, when the Permanent Court of International Justice, founded by the League of Nations, ruled against Norway.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the United Nations pushed for decolonization in Greenland. In 1953, the former colony was incorporated into Denmark and granted two seats in the Danish Parliament. In 1979, Greenland achieved Home Rule, which included the formation of the Greenlandic Parliament, and it gained self-rule in 2009 through the passage of a law that included a ‘blueprint’ for seeking independence. The 2009 law firmly established that the decision to go for independence from Denmark would now rest with the Greenlandic people.\n\nThere is no doubt that the majority of Greenlanders want to use this option eventually. Polls show this. Independence has been accepted in Denmark as well. However, polls also consistently show that Greenlanders do not want independence if the price is the collapse of the Greenlandic welfare state. Herein lies the challenge. Greenland is vast, stretching over more than 800,000 square miles, but its population is tiny, consisting of only 56,000 people. Furthermore, the climate remains harsh for most of the year, especially in the North. For these reasons, among others, the Greenlandic government remains dependent on a yearly block grant from Denmark of roughly $600 million, as well as on the Danish state supporting services in areas such as defense, coast guard, and law enforcement. Greenlandic independence, therefore, depends on substantial continued Danish assistance after independence, something the Greenlandic government has yet to convince Denmark to accept.\n\nIt is in this context that President Donald Trump saw an opening to acquire Greenland. American strategic interests in Greenland are not new, but stretch back into the 19th century. Extensive U.S. involvement in Greenland, however, did not materialize until the Second World War, triggered by the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940. As such, the German occupation of Denmark put Greenland in a peculiar position and caused worry in the United States that Greenland’s geography could eventually be used against it. For that reason, Washington reacted favorably when the Danish ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, took the rather unusual step of proposing himself as the true representative of free Denmark, cutting bonds with the occupied country. Kauffmann offered the United States base rights in Greenland for the duration of the war.\n\nThis was the start of the U.S. presence in Greenland. After the Second World War, a liberated Denmark honored Kauffmann’s commitments, and from 1949, the United States and Denmark became allies through NATO. During the Cold War and the decades after, the U.S. safeguarded its security interests in Greenland: tracking Russian missiles, bomber planes, and nuclear-armed submarines from that location. This became the basis for the “Greenland card” in U.S.-Danish relations: the idea that base rights in Greenland constituted an important contribution from Denmark and Greenland to the U.S. and NATO.\n\nThis state of affairs changed with Donald Trump. In the broader context of U.S.-European relations in the age of “America First,” the U.S. had to push its ‘free-riding’ European allies to do more on every front. No longer would Washington be satisfied with having a free hand in Greenland. Instead, Denmark was now a bad ally for not taking responsibility for U.S. security concerning Greenland. In Trump’s narrative, this perceived Danish lapse justified an American takeover of Greenland in its entirety. Trump even went so far as to refuse to rule out the use of military force. Other reasons, voiced by Trump, included securing mineral wealth, especially rare earth minerals, as well as a more general ambition to make the U.S. greater through territorial expansion.\n\nThe Greenlandic right to self-determination should form the bedrock for any future developments. For that reason, as well as for many other reasons, the U.S. military conquest of Greenland is beyond unacceptable. The American public agrees: in a February 2025 poll, only 11% expressed support for using military force to take control of Greenland, while 69% opposed it. This may be why the Trump administration has not mentioned the military ‘option’ recently. Instead, the Trump administration now seems focused on winning over the ‘hearts and minds’ of the Greenlanders. At the same time, stories about US influence agents compiling lists of pro-American and anti-American individuals caused understandable worry in Nuuk and Copenhagen – a behavior that few countries would expect from their allies.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has not been particularly successful. A poll from January shows that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of joining the U.S., with 85% against it. Greenlandic politicians have rejected the idea on numerous occasions, and in March, the party leaders of all Greenlandic parties issued a joint rejection of American attempts to annex Greenland. Most telling, the Trump team had to give up on finding Greenlandic hosts willing to meet the Second Lady Usha Vance during her planned trip to Nuuk that month.\n\nWhere do we go from here? The United States should cease its ill-fated adventurism and work with Greenland and Denmark to secure its legitimate security interests. This would be nothing new, but a return to policies that served the United States well for the last 75 years.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — For House Republicans, the political year started with a pep rally of sorts as President Donald Trump gathered them at Washington's Kennedy Center for a stemwinder of a speech. But by the time lawmakers had completed their first week of work this midterm election year, fractures in the party were already showing.\n\nFrom pushback to Trump's self-described “Donroe doctrine” of aggression in the Western Hemisphere to breaks in party unity over health care, Republican lawmakers are displaying signs of independence from Trump after spending much of the last year acquiescing to his practically every demand. It showed a new dynamic in the GOP as Republicans embark on difficult campaign to keep control of both the House and Senate.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, speaking at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday with a group of Republican Senate candidates, said that Republicans were “going to be focused like a laser” on issues of affordability and pointed to legislation in the works on housing and health care.\n\nThune's border trip and talk of affordability were a nod back to some of the core themes of Trump's presidential campaign. But the focus in Washington of late has instead been dominated by Trump's military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, his threats to use military force to take control of Greenland, the release of case files on Jeffrey Epstein and a debate over extending subsidies for insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act — an issue where Republicans have long struggled to find unity.\n\nRecent shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in several U.S. cities, including one that killed a woman in Minneapolis, have also raised new questions about Republicans' hard-line immigration agenda and shifted attention away from Trump's handling of the border, which they see as a political success.\n\nEven so, Trump still has plenty of command over most of the party. That was demonstrated this week by a pair of unsuccessful House veto override votes in which most GOP members stuck with the president despite previously voting for the low-profile bills.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been one of the few Republicans to consistently defy Trump, said that “there was some bully pulpit intimidation going on” from the president that caused the veto overrides to fail.\n\nStill, Democrats are making the case that Trump is becoming distracted from the needs of Americans, especially after the attack on Venezuela.\n\n“He's lurching towards another endless, expensive war, all the while American families here are struggling with skyrocketing costs,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nVenezuela war powers vote draws GOP support\n\nTo prove their point, Democrats are forcing votes on war powers resolutions that would stop Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional approval. Such measures are rarely successful, but a procedural vote on the legislation drew support from five Republicans Thursday, setting up a final vote next week. House Democrats are also pushing forward a similar resolution.\n\nThe GOP senators who voted for the legislation tried to defuse the conflict with Trump by arguing their positions were in line with his own campaign promises to scale back U.S. commitments overseas.\n\n“A drawn-out campaign in Venezuela involving the American military, even if unintended, would be the opposite of President Trump’s goal of ending foreign entanglements,” Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who voted for the war powers resolution, said in a lengthy statement explaining his vote.\n\nTrump reacted with fury. The president promptly called for the five Republicans, which included Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection this year, to “never be elected to office again.”\n\nRepublicans are already dealing with retirements from several lawmakers who had uneasy relationships with Trump, and there was worry that such clashes could complicate their campaign picture even more.\n\n“If Susan isn’t the senator from Maine, we’re going to end up with a Democrat,” said Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican. “That would be 10 times worse. But I do appreciate that President Trump is absolutely pissed off.”\n\nGOP pushes back on Trump's Greenland plans\n\nTrump's desire to possess Greenland and his administration's decision not to rule out military force also met significant resistance from GOP lawmakers this week.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who is retiring after crossing Trump last summer, took to the Senate floor to proclaim that he was “sick of stupid.” He specifically criticized White House deputy chief of policy Stephen Miller, who made comments that Greenland should be part of the U.S.\n\n“I want good advice for this president, because I want this president to have a good legacy,” Tillis added. “And this nonsense on what’s going on with Greenland is a distraction from the good work he’s doing, and the amateurs who said it was a good idea should lose their jobs.”\n\nOther Republicans, including Thune and Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Roger Wicker, also gently pushed back on military threats against Denmark, which is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nAfter meeting with the Danish ambassador, Wicker said it was Denmark's right not to sell Greenland.\n\n“I’m troubled by Greenland. I'm troubled by some of the things he does. I don’t get it,” said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, another retiring Republican. “I do feel like Congress should be more independent and should provide checks and balances here.”\n\nBacon added that Trump still had the ability to “bully” his Republican colleagues, but that Trump's threats had “stiffened my spine.”\n\nHealth care votes expose divisions\n\nDuring Trump's speech at the Kennedy Center on Tuesday, he urged Republicans to own the issue of health care. Yet when the House voted Thursday on a Democratic proposal to extend expired health care subsidies for Affordable Care Act health plans, 17 Republicans broke with party leadership to help pass the bill.\n\n“People recognize the challenge here, which is to address health care affordability,” said Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican who voted for the proposal.\n\nHe still criticized the Affordable Care Act, a hallmark piece of legislation for Democrats, yet the health care debate unfolding in Congress is one that Democrats feel confident making a central campaign issue.\n\n“In this first, full week of the new year, House Democrats — every single one of us joined by 17 Republicans — have partnered in a bipartisan way to protect the health care of the American people,” said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries following the vote.\n\nJan. 6 plaque coming out of storage\n\nOn the fifth anniversary of the attack on the Capitol, Trump told House Republicans that he had told his supporters to go “peacefully and patriotically” to confront Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. The White House also unveiled a website that portrayed the Jan. 6 attack as a “witch hunt” against him by Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.\n\nBut the Senate, which Republicans control, this week agreed to display a plaque honoring the police who defended the Capitol — a cause that has become a point of contention with Trump as president. The plaque had been kept in storage rather than being displayed because House Speaker Mike Johnson had said the memorial did not comply with the law.\n\nIt was Tillis again who pushed the issue on the Republican side. He said it was important to honor the police and staff who risked their own lives and safety that day.\n\nDemocrats who joined in the effort said they were alarmed by the White House's attempt to recast the narrative.\n\n“It's so important we be honest with the American people about what happened,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nThis story has corrected the party affiliation of Rep. Mike Lawler. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNeil Young has called out US President Donald Trump for making America a \"disaster\", and called on US citizens to \"rise up\" in peaceful protests against his regime.\n\nYoung delivered his acerbic condemnation of Trump in an strongly-worded editorial piece on the Times Contrarian section of his website. \n\n\"Wake up, people!\" he writes. \"Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes, people with no experience or talent, closet alcoholic wife beaters, inexperienced leaders who only know how to lie to keep favor with Trump’s falseness so they can hold their unearned positions in his inept government, a Congress full of Republicans acting like idiots with no conscience…He has divided us. How did we elect these creeps who have no spin, no values, no conscience, no way to save the USA.\n\n\"We need to take Trump at his word,\" he continues. \"Make America Great Again. It won't be easy while he is trying to turn our cities into battlegrounds so he can cancel our elections with marshal law and escape all accountability…Something has to change this. We know what to do. Rise up. Peacefully in millions. Too many innocence [sic] people are dying.\n\n\"It’s ICE cold here in America. There was no ICE before Trump. No soldiers in the streets before Trump. Every move he makes is to build instability so he can stay in power.\n\n\"He knows nothing about love,\" Young concludes. \"He does not know you are. Use your love of life, your love of one another, your love of children and theirs and ours. Peacefully. Now.\"\n\nWake up, people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America\n\nYoung's editiorial follows on from another piece where he expressed his outrage at the killing of Renee Nicole Good by a US immigration agent in Minneapolis on January 7. \n\n\"This morning an ICE officer shot a woman in the face three times for no reason in Minneapolis,\" he wrote. \"These ICE people do not operate like police. They are thugs. poor ID. Covered faces. Is ICE the new American Thug police?\"\n\nYoung also hit out at the administration's controversial comments on taking over Greenland, and at the removal of women and people of colour from military leadership.\n\nThis is not the first time Young has condemned Donald Trump's presidency. Last August, the singer-songwriter released a track called Big Crime in which he offered a searing indictment of Trump's second term in the White House.\n\nThe lyrics for one section of the song run:\n\n\"Got to get the fascists out\nGot to clean the White House out\nDon’t want soldiers on our streets\nThere’s big crime in DC at the White House\"",

    "title": "White House says it’s ‘reviewing protocols’ after Trump seemingly violated federal policy by disclosing jobs data early",
    "description": "The White House claims \"there was an inadvertent public disclosure\" but it says the media shouldn't be \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"",
    "fullText": "The White House said Friday that it is “reviewing protocols” around economic data releases after President Donald Trump appeared to disclose sensitive jobs information ahead of its official publication, a move that economists described as “unprecedented” and potentially in violation of long-standing federal policy.\n\nIn a statement provided on background, a White House official said the episode stemmed from “an inadvertent public disclosure” following routine presidential briefings on economic data.\n\nThis occurred “following the regular procedure of presidents being prebriefed on economic data releases,” the official said. “The White House is accordingly reviewing protocols regarding economic data releases.”\n\nThe official bristled at the criticism of the disclosure, arguing that media coverage had overplayed its significance.\n\n“Instead of grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy, however, the media would be better off covering what today’s job report actually shows,” the official said, adding that President Trump’s policies are “laying the groundwork for an economic resurgence as GDP and real wage growth continue to accelerate.”\n\nThe comments come after Trump posted an image to Truth Social late Thursday evening that included figures from Friday morning’s nonfarm payrolls report, hours before the data was released publicly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nOffice of Management and Budget policy bars executive branch officials from commenting on or releasing market-moving economic statistics prior to their official publication, and also prohibits public statements until at least 30 minutes after release. While presidents are briefed on jobs data in advance, those briefings are treated as confidential.\n\nBharat Kumar, an economist at the financial firm Futures First, spotted that the figures in Trump’s post matched the final numbers released Friday morning. Economist and professor at University of Michigan Justin Wolfers said on X the disclosure “unprecedented,” saying no prior White House had ever released market-moving jobs data ahead of schedule.\n\n“No serious country does this,” Wolfers wrote.\n\nThe figures would have been difficult to interpret, anyway, because the large revisions to earlier months meant that the actually new numbers could not be cleanly isolated to show what happened in December alone, Nick Timaraos, the Wall Street Journal’s chief economics correspondent, noted.\n\nFriday’s jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 in December, with nearly all of the gains coming from healthcare and social assistance. Stocks edged higher following the release, easing fears of a sharper employment slowdown.\n\nThe leak had drawn limited attention before Kumar’s post, likely because the disclosure occurred on Truth Social, a platform with a very small audience. According to Pew Research Center, just 3% of U.S. adults say they have ever used Truth Social, compared with 84% who use YouTube, 71% Facebook, 50% Instagram, and 21% X.\n\nSome media outlets, instead of decrying a scandal, had fun with that element of the mishap, with the Financial Times’ voicey Alphaville paraphrasing the old hypothetical about a tree falling in the forest: “If a jobs report leaks on a social media platform no one uses, does it move the market?” (This reporter was delayed in filing this story because Truth Social appeared to malfunction, preventing access to both the post and the President’s page.)\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge said Friday that she expects to temporarily block efforts by the Trump administration to end a program that offered temporary legal protections for more than 10,000 family members of citizens and green card holders.\n\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said at a hearing that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order but did not say when it would be issued. This case is part of a broader effort by the administration to end temporary legal protection for numerous groups and comes just over a week since another judge ruled that hundreds of people from South Sudan may live and work in the United States legally.\n\n“The government, having invited people to apply, is now laying traps between those people and getting the green card,” Justin Cox, an attorney who works with Justice Action Center and who argued the case for the plaintiffs, said. “That is incredibly inequitable.”\n\nThis case involved a program called Family Reunification Parole, or FRP, and impacts people from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras. Most of them are set to lose their legal protections, which were put in place during the Biden administration, by Jan. 14. The Department of Homeland Security terminated protections late last year.\n\nThe case involves five plaintiffs but lawyers are seeking to have any ruling cover everyone that is part of the program.\n\n“Although in a temporary status, these parolees did not come temporarily; they came to get a jump-start on their new lives in the United States, typically bringing immediate family members with them,” plaintiffs wrote in their motion. “Since they arrived, FRP parolees have gotten employment authorization documents, jobs, and enrolled their kids in school.”\n\nThe government, in its brief and in court, argued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has the authority to terminate any parole program and gave adequate notice by publishing the termination in the federal registry. It also argued that the program's termination was necessary on national security grounds because the people had not been property vetted. It also said resources to maintain this program would be better used in other immigration programs.\n\n“Parole can be terminated at any time,” Katie Rose Talley, a lawyer for the government told the court. \"That is what is being done. There is nothing unlawful about that.\"\n\nTalwani conceded that the government can end the program but she took issue with the way it was done.\n\nThe government argued that just announcing in the federal registry that it was ending the program was sufficient. But Talwani demanded the government show how it has alerted people through a written notice — a letter or email — that the program was ending.\n\n“I understand why plaintiffs feel like they came here and made all these plans and were going to be here for a very long time,” Talwani said. “I have a group of people who are trying to follow the law. I am saying to you that, we as Americans, the United States needs to.”\n\nLower courts have largely supported keeping temporary protections for many groups. But in May, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip temporary legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants for now, pushing the total number of people who could be newly exposed to deportation to nearly 1 million.\n\nThe justices lifted a lower-court order that kept humanitarian parole protections in place for more than 500,000 migrants from four countries: Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The decision came after the court allowed the administration to revoke temporary legal status from about 350,000 Venezuelan migrants in another case.\n\nThe court did not explain its reasoning in the brief order, as is typical on its emergency docket. Two justices publicly dissented.",

    "title": "Trump's message to defense contractors: There might be a lot more money coming, but only if you deliver",
    "description": "The White House is calling for much more defense spending while pressuring contractors to prioritize production over profits.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump sent jolts through the defense industry this week by mixing talk of a $1.5 trillion defense budget with a blunt warning to contractors: Prioritize production and readiness, not Wall Street.\n\nThe apparent messaging behind a string of Truth Social posts, a new executive order, and the president's call for boosting the defense budget by 50% is that there's going to be a lot of cash on the table, but only for companies that produce and deliver weapons on time.\n\nA venture capital investor focused on aerospace and defense told Business Insider that Trump is effectively saying: \"I've got a really big pool of money here, but I'm only going to be giving it to people that are going to play ball.\"\n\nThe new executive order empowers the Pentagon to pressure contractors that it feels aren't moving fast enough and are perceived to instead be prioritizing profits for top executives and shareholder returns over production demands.\n\nThe Pentagon is now authorized to crack down on underperforming defense contractors by limiting stock buybacks and dividends, linking executive pay to production and delivery, and using contract and emergency authorities to force faster output and investment.\n\nThere are questions about the degree to which the Department of Defense can influence company decisions, but it sends a clear signal that the government intends to at least try to tell weapons makers how to run their businesses.\n\n\"MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS NOT BEING MADE FAST ENOUGH,\" Trump wrote on social media this week before singling out the major defense firm Raytheon (now RTX Corp) in a follow-up post.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up,\" Trump wrote, urging the company to build more facilities and equipment, \"or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government. RTX is one of the world's leading producers of missiles like the Tomahawk cruise missile; it also makes radars and sensors, among other technologies.\n\nIt's extremely unusual to see this level of federal government involvement in contractor financial decisions.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" Jerry McGinn, the director of the Center for the Industrial Base at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, told Business Insider.\n\nDefense stocks tumbled hard with the string of announcements but jumped as the Trump administration floated the possibility of a massive increase in defense spending, which would need Congress's approval.\n\nThis new push reflects growing concern that America’s defense sector has slipped, with capacity, capability, and experience today well below Cold War levels, leaving the US potentially ill-prepared for the possibility of a major war, such as a conflict with China.\n\nThe Trump administration appears to be trying to force a reset while also offering more money and more predictable demand, acknowledging the government itself has not always been a reliable customer. The hollowing out of the defense industry since the Cold War's end has left the federal government highly dependent on a few companies with the necessary industrial facilities to design and produce complex weapons on a large scale.\n\nThe administration has signaled from the get-go that the big established arms makers are in its crosshairs, with a dramatic shift in support toward agile start-ups over the primes, even if it's still making substantial business deals with them.\n\n\"We are going to completely disrupt the system that held the Army back for decades and lined the primes' pockets for so long,\" Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said last year.\n\nThe Army's top civilian official previously said that he would like to see one of the big defense power players in the contracting world go out of business. And now there's increased pressure.\n\n\"The EO is more of a hammer,\" McGinn said of Trump's newest executive order targeting the US defense industrial base.\n\n\"It still raises a lot of questions about what's enforceable,\" he added, especially with some of the Truth Social mandates that weren't included in the executive order. But \"the strategy is all about focusing on how do you change, how do you make it more attractive for companies to invest, to build factories ahead of need.\"\n\nWith the president's new executive order on defense contracting, the companies that \"stand to lose the most\" are \"the existing primes,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of Fortuna Investments, an America-first venture capital firm, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Legacy defense companies,\" Parmar said, \"they're kind of like taxicabs. They need a bit of disruption.\" He sees the rising defense firms like the ride-share companies that changed the game.\n\nThe primes, the biggest defense contractors, are far from powerless. Their scale, capital, and decades of experience give them room to resist pressure, and in certain defense technologies, they remain the only game in town.\n\nLockheed Martin, for instance, is still producing F-35 stealth fighters, Huntington Ingalls Industries is still building aircraft carriers, and Boeing has a major contract for the new sixth-generation F-47 fighter jet.\n\nWhile some big companies didn't respond, others signaled a willingness to engage. Lockheed Martin, for instance, said it \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nThe newcomers, the start-ups and rising firms making big plays \"have the most to gain\" from what's unfolding right now, Parmar said, calling the latest Trump moves a \"tide shift.\"\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Anduril, said this week that he \"broadly\" supports the president's agenda, saying that \"it's good to scare people sometimes.\" Anduril has been pitting itself up against major defense contractors in areas of emerging tech, like collaborative combat aircraft, advanced drones designed to operate alongside piloted fighters.\n\nMcGinn said \"there's a strong recognition that we need to get more out of our defense industrial base and we need new entrants.\" New technology spaces like drones, counter-drone systems, and command and control architecture improvements are opening the doors for new players, particularly those that move fast.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth laid out the administration's approach last November, briefing industry CEOs and releasing a new acquisition strategy aimed at overhauling what it calls an outdated system and a weakened defense industrial base.\n\nHegseth has said his focus is on building the \"arsenal of freedom\" to better prepare the US military for modern warfare.\n\nThe plan is aimed at accelerating modernization, rapidly expanding production, surging capacity, and putting military acquisition and industry on a \"wartime footing\" that favors speed and execution over process.\n\nThis process takes time though, Parmar said. \"The existing primes, they're entrenched. They're not going anywhere quickly.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a slow bleed,\" he said,\" a slow transition until some of these other companies start to get market share.\"",

    "description": "Trump's Education Department concluded another round of negotiations focused on gainful employment, aimed at protecting student-loan borrowers.",
    "fullText": "How do you make sure you can afford the student debt you're taking on?\n\nIt's a complicated question that President Donald Trump's Education Department spent a week hashing out. On Friday, the department concluded negotiations and reached consensus on its proposal to strengthen accountability in student-loan borrowing, including revising the gainful employment rule.\n\n\"This is a game changer,\" Nicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, said in his closing remarks. \"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results.\"\n\nSome of these changes are part of Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The Department of Education has already completed negotiations on some of the student-loan provisions in the bill, including the creation of new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, which will begin taking effect in July.\n\nThe revisions debated this week include eliminating the debt-to-earnings ratio test, which ensured a borrower's student-loan payments are no more than 8% of their annual earnings. It said this would reduce complexity. Some education policy experts worry it would weaken protections for students.\n\nCarolyn Fast, the director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider that it \"makes a lot of sense\" for the Department of Education to streamline the metrics, but the proposal risks leaving students with debt they're unable to repay with the elimination of the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nGainful employment, first established by former President Barack Obama in 2014, cut off federal student aid for schools that offered programs that left students with unaffordable debt compared to their likely postgrad income. Trump repealed the rule during his first term in 2019, and former President Joe Biden reinstated it. The existing version went into effect in July 2024.\n\nBiden's version of the rule used two separate metrics to determine whether a program met gainful employment requirements: a debt-to-earnings test and an earnings premium test, which measured whether a typical graduate from the program is earning at least as much as they typical high school graduate in their state.\n\nIn addition to eliminating the debt-to-earnings test, the Department of Education's proposal would allow programs to continue receiving Pell Grant funding even if they fail the earnings premium test. However, if at least half of Title IV funds, which include Pell Grant funds, are going toward programs that fail the earnings premium test, the department would strip all funding from the failing program.\n\nWhile removing Pell eligibility for some failing programs is better than nothing, the two changes could weaken protections for students, Fast said.\n\n\"We're worried that low-income students will exhaust their limited Pell Grant eligibility on programs that don't provide a return on their investment,\" Fast said.\n\nResearch that Fast coauthored, for example, found that in 2022, about 169,000 students received Title IV aid to enroll in programs that would pass the earnings premium test but fail the debt-to-earnings test.\n\nThe department's negotiator said that the gainful employment changes will not be ready by the start of the 2026 academic year, so the new requirements are set to go into effect in the fall of 2027.\n\nLawmakers have previously pushed for a strengthened gainful employment rule. A group of Democratic lawmakers in 2023 called on the Biden administration to put forth a rule that protects students who enroll in \"postsecondary programs that saddle students with unaffordable debt and provide low financial returns.\"",

    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "description": "In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he would impose a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has taken another shot at big business, targeting banks this time.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he added. \"Coincidentally, the January 20th date will coincide with the one year anniversary of the historic and very successful Trump Administration.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The president cannot unilaterally impose such a cap; it would require an act of Congress. Similar efforts that have been advanced in Congress have yet to become law.\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, representatives for Chase and Citi pointed to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America. The statement said that the trade organizations \"share the President's goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.\"\n\n\"At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the joint statement read. \"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a jab against the president on X for not yet having introduced a proposal to cap credit card interest — a pledge Trump made during his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders wrote. \"The result? Last year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made $770 million. Unacceptable.\"\n\nIn the first few months of his second term, the Trump administration slashed funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency responsible for protecting consumers by ensuring that financial markets are fair and competitive.\n\nTrump's announcement, made on Truth Social, is the latest in a series of swipes at big business the president has made this week.\n\nEarlier this week, he said that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments. He also said he was barring \"large institutional investors\" from buying up single-family homes and signed an executive order that would limit defense contractors' corporate spending.",
