    "description": "The US reaching a diplomatic agreement with Denmark that could expand the US's presence in Greenland looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said.",
    "fullText": "That is, Trump Always Chickens Out, or the idea that the president's aggressive policy tactics are mostly bluster aimed at getting a party to the negotiating table.\n\nThat's the question investors are mulling this week as the market swoons amid Trump's fiery comments about the future of Greenland, which he has said the US needs to control for national security.\n\nThe White House has told investors not to count on Trump backing down before, but his latest attempt to put pressure on Denmark has Wall Street talking about the president's notorious negotiation style again.\n\nTrump's most recent maneuver has been to threaten eight European nations with 10% tariffs starting in February, ramping up to 25% in June if no deal on Greenland is reached.\n\nTo some forecasters, the Greenland situation is clear: It's another opportunity for investors to position for the TACO trade.\n\n\"I think we need to read this from an 'Art of the Deal' perspective,\" analysts at JPMorgan's international markets intelligence desk wrote in a note on Tuesday. \"Trump creates noise and throws in a maximal stance designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage/urgency.\"\n\n\"The market wants to see if today is TACO Tuesday,\" the bank's market intelligence team added.\n\n\"How much uncertainty investors can stomach is a good question, but the resolve in the FOMO and TACO trade (the belief that President Trump is bluffing on Greenland and is only working to secure a 'deal') has proven time and again to be very difficult to break,\" David Rosenberg, a top economist and the president of Rosenberg Research, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nAmid talk of a TACO trade revival, analysts say they see a handful of outcomes from Trump's tough talk on Greenland. Here are three ways forecasters see the situation playing out.\n\nThe US reaching an agreement with Denmark that could expand US presence in Greenland — such as by getting access to the territory's natural resources — looks like the most likely outcome, JPMorgan said, pegging the scenario with a 55% probability.\n\n\"We know Trump opens with a maximal stance, designed to trigger negotiation and create leverage. This is no different,\" the bank said, noting that the timing of the tariff threats looked \"not coincidental,\" given that the World Economic Forum is in full swing this week.\n\nAnalysts added that a sale of Greenland looks \"less likely\" due to the need to get Denmark's approval, and the US using military force to take Greenland looks \"highly unlikely,\" since it would draw pushback from Republican lawmakers and voters. The US attacking another NATO member could also open the door to further aggression from the bloc's rivals, JPMorgan added.\n\nThere's a 40% chance Trump's new tariffs won't be implemented at all, possibly by Trump's \"own retreat,\" according to Matt Gertken, the chief geopolitical and US political strategist at BCA Research.\n\nGertken added that he believed there was a 70% chance the situation in Greenland would have a \"non-military\" solution, and a 30% chance that solution would involve a short-term trade war with Europe.\n\n\"Global stocks would fall, while US treasuries and the dollar would fall, but the administration would then change course, as it did after Liberation Day,\" he wrote in a client note on Monday.\n\nChristopher Granville, a managing director at TS Lombard, added that he believed the most likely outcome was a \"truce\" between the US and Europe, with the US likely suspending tariffs as negotiations over Greenland stretch on.\n\nThat was what happened when Trump first introduced tariffs on Mexico and Canada last year, Granville added, later pointing to political pressures from the coming midterm elections, which could incentivize Trump to lower tariffs.\n\n\"Some commentators may slap the TACO label on any such truce that could be agreed at this week's in-person meetings in Davos between Trump and various European leaders,\" Granville said, though he noted that the situation wouldn't be a \"TACO for real\" scenario, since the US wasn't backing down on Greenland entirely.\n\nThe expected Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs could also come into play.\n\nBCA estimated there was around a 50% chance the Supreme Court could strike down Trump's tariffs, up from a 30% chance the firm had predicted earlier.\n\n\"Normally the court would defer to the president on international issues. But now the president threatens to entangle the court in lawless behavior that threatens the court's credibility and the constitutional balance of powers,\" Gertken said, pointing to Trump's threats against the NATO alliance. \"So we have less confidence that the court will defend the president's stance.\"\n\nJPMorgan's international market intelligence team said the latest tariff threats were \"riddled with challenges.\"\n\n\"First, the proposed tariffs are based on IEEPEA, which the Supreme Court could imminently rule to be illegal in their application. Second, I would think it practically impossible to tariff 6x EU countries at a different rate to other members, given the freedom of movement of goods which structurally exists within the EU,\" the bank's Matthew See wrote.",

    "fullText": "US stocks plunged, and bonds sold off on Tuesday on Donald Trump's feud with Europe over Greenland.\n\nAfter spending much of 2025 doubting the president over everything from tariffs to threats to fire Fed boss Jerome Powell, stocks had their worst day since October amid Donald Trump's fight with European nations about who should control the Danish territory.\n\nThe sell America trade was in the spotlight again on Tuesday amid the latest turmoil.\n\nUS stocks plunged as investors took in the latest tariff threats targeting eight European Union countries if Denmark doesn't put Greenland up for sale by the start of February. EU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\nMajor indexes fell sharply, with losses accelerating in afternoon trading. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, and traders sought shelter in defensive assets like gold and silver. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined more than 2%.\n\nLong-dated US Treasury yields spiked, while the US dollar declined against a basket of other currencies. Highlighting tensions in the bond market, a Danish pension said it was exiting the market for US government debt, with plans to dump $100 million in Treasurys due to \"poor\" US government finances.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 4 p.m. ET closing bell on Tuesday:\n\nHere were other big moves across markets:\n\nUntil now, investors had mostly brushed off Trump's talk of taking over Greenland.\n\nThat seems to have changed now that tariffs are back in the picture.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said eight NATO countries, including Denmark, would face a 10% tariff on goods exported to the US in February, with the rate increasing to 25% in June if Denmark doesn't agree to \"the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\"\n\n\"The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years,\" the president wrote on his social media platform over the weekend, pointing to new defense initiatives that make acquiring Greenland \"especially important\" for the US.\n\n\"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades,\" he continued.\n\nThe sell-off has largely been driven by investors trimming their exposure to US equities now that tariffs, a major concern for markets all throughout last year, appear to be on the table, David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors also seem worried that the Supreme Court ruling on Trump's reciprocal tariffs could add further volatility in markets, he added.\n\n\"The US President upped his aggressive rhetoric overnight,\" Morrison said of the selling pressure. \"While some on Wall Street argue any tariff-driven sell-off could be a buying opportunity as the earnings season picks up steam, the scale and breadth of Trump's rhetoric have unsettled risk appetite.\"\n\nThe latest tariff threats are also driving a flight to safe-haven or defensive assets, like metals. Gold rose another 3% while silver jumped 8%.\n\n\"Global investors are clearly adding to the risk premium embedded in US assets, and diversification flows are picking up,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nA major move in Japan's bond market also contributed to some of the volatility in the US. The yield on Japan's 40-year government bond hit a record 4.21% on Tuesday as investors weighed a new tax cut proposal that has raised concerns about the nation's growing deficit.\n\nThe nation's 10-year government bond yield also increased by more than 10 basis points to trade around 2.38%, a level that hasn't been seen in 27 years.\n\nRising yields in Japan have sparked fresh concern about the amount of foreign capital flowing into US markets. Specifically, investors are worried about the unwinding of the yen carry trade, a popular strategy in which traders borrow money at low rates in Japan to deploy in markets that offer higher returns, such as the US.\n\n\"As a sliding yen triggers intervention chatter, the fate of the massive 'yen-carry trade' hangs in the balance,\" Ed Yardeni, the President of Yardeni Research, wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",

    "description": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.",
    "fullText": "A series of graphics reveals how the Trump administration has sought historic cuts to science and the research workforce.\n\nGrant termination data analysis and visualization by Kim Albrecht\n\nMMore than 7,800 research grants terminated or frozen. Some 25,000 scientists and personnel gone from agencies that oversee research. Proposed budget cuts of 35% — amounting to US$32 billion.\n\nThese are just a few of the ways in which Donald Trump has downsized and disrupted US science since returning to the White House last January. As his administration seeks to reshape US research and development, it has substantially scaled back and restricted what science the country pursues and the workforce that runs the federal scientific enterprise.\n\nA year into Trump’s second presidential term, Nature presents a series of graphics that reveal the impact of his administration on science.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, officials began terminating already-funded grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in February, and later at the National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest public supporters of scientific research in the United States. A total of 5,844 NIH grants and 1,996 NSF grants were cancelled or suspended.\n\nThe Trump administration disproportionally cancelled or froze projects on topics it disfavours, such as misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, infectious diseases and research on people from under-represented ethnic and gender groups, which it has called discriminatory and unscientific.\n\nOver the course of 2025, more than 7,800 grants were cancelled or suspended. In this tree map, each block represents one grant or grant supplement, and the size of the block corresponds to the total budget of the original grant.\n\nThe inclusion of supplements means that some grants — less than 0.5% of the total — appear two or three times.\n\nThe blocks are grouped by state. New York (orange) had the most cancelled or frozen grants, totalling nearly 1,500. The majority were at Columbia University.\n\nSome of the largest grants (orange) are for clinical trials, cancer centres and infrastructure, and they can run over many years.\n\nThe NIH terminated or froze 5,843 research grants (yellow). The total for the NSF was 1,996 (blue).\n\nOf the grants that were terminated or frozen, more than 800 were related to infectious diseases (orange).\n\nCourts have ordered that thousands of grants be reinstated, and some universities have settled with the government to unfreeze funding (both reinstated and unfrozen grants are shown in blue). But it is unclear how many scientists have received those funds.\n\nRoughly 2,600 grants have not been reinstated or unfrozen (black), amounting to $1.4 billion of unspent funding.\n\nThe Trump administration has substantially reduced the number of new grants issued by the NSF and the NIH, which means that fewer researchers are getting support.\n\nIn 2025, the total number of new grants funded by the NSF dropped by 25% relative to the average of the previous ten years. In part, this resulted from uncertainty about future funding, and the agency’s decision to provide multi-year funding — in which a project’s budget is awarded all at once, rather than year by year.\n\nA similar story played out at the NIH, which issued 24% fewer grants in 2025, compared with the average of the previous ten years. After delays early in the year and with reduced staff levels, the agency raced to award grants by the end of the fiscal year. It achieved this in part by providing multi-year funding to a smaller number of new grant applications than usual — sharply reducing the number of scientists that received support.\n\nDuring the 2025–26 academic year, new international-student enrolment at US universities fell markedly. The Institute of International Education (IIE), a non-profit organization in New York City, released preliminary data, based on a subset of universities, showing a 17% decline from 2024 to 2025. This would result in the smallest number of new international enrolments in a decade, except for in 2020–21, during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese trends are not uniform. An IIE survey found that about 60% of colleges and universities saw decreases, whereas 40% reported stable or increasing numbers. Of those experiencing declines, 96% cited visa-application concerns as a contributing factor. These concerns have intensified under the second Trump administration.\n\nIn total, federal science agencies lost about 20% of their staff in 2025 relative to the previous year, after modest increases over the past few years.\n\nAmong the hardest hit are the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA, both of which have been targets of the Trump administration’s attacks on climate science. The Food and Drug Administration also lost more than 20% of its staff.\n\nSome employees were fired during mass layoffs in early 2025, but most left voluntarily through a programme that offered incentives for federal workers to resign. Across the science agencies, there was an exodus of more than 25,000 people, many of whom were at early career stages.\n\nRemaining staff members at agencies such as the NIH and the NSF say they struggle to keep up with the workload, which includes approving research grants.\n\nIn its proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year, the Trump administration requested historic cuts of 35% to the budget for research and development not related to defence. The final funding levels will be determined through spending bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate in an ongoing process.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation, the president’s proposed decrease in funding for non-defence research would be unprecedented over the past half century and would reduce spending to 1991 levels.\n\nBut in enacted spending bills, lawmakers in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have so far rejected the most drastic budget cuts for many of the core science agencies. Policy experts hope that Congress will continue its long-standing support for science agencies when it finalizes the 2026 budget in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trump administration shocked the science community when it proposed slashing more than $18 billion, or around 40% of the total, from the budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world.\n\nThe Trump administration also sought steep cuts at the National Science Foundation (57%) and NASA’s Science Mission Directorate (47%). In final budget agreements that are likely to be adopted by the House and the Senate, lawmakers agreed on much smaller cuts of 3.4% for the NSF and 1.1% for NASA’s science directorate.\n\nThe House and the Senate must finish negotiating final budgets for the remaining agencies, such as the NIH, and the actual funding levels will probably be somewhere in the middle. That would mostly protect the country’s total budget for research and development from the Trump administration’s drastic cuts for the current fiscal year.\n\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.",

    "fullText": "CNN medical analyst Jonathan Reiner has called on Congress to launch an investigation into Donald Trump‘s “fitness” to serve as President, following his ongoing attempts to own Greenland.\n\nReiner, who previously served as cardiologist to the late Vice President Dick Cheney, took to X on Monday (January 19) to share his thoughts on Trump’s letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre. In the letter, the president appears to link his threats to acquire Greenland to his not having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump wrote in the letter, which he also asked to be distributed to other European countries.\n\nIn his post, Reiner wrote, “This letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness.”\n\nThis letter, and the fact that the president directed that it be distributed to other European countries, should trigger a bipartisan congressional inquiry into presidential fitness. https://t.co/HkHzsiTau4\n\n— Jonathan Reiner (@JReinerMD) January 19, 2026\n\nReiner’s comments come just days after he said Trump needed to be evaluated, following a recent Oval Office meeting that appeared to show the President falling asleep while surrounded by officials and guests.\n\n“The president seems to be struggling with excessive daytime somnolence,” Reiner wrote, referring to the condition Hypersomnia, which makes a person feel extremely sleepy during the day. “Repeatedly falling asleep with a dozen people surrounding your desk is not normal. It needs to be evaluated.”\n\nReiner has spoken frequently about his concerns for Trump’s health in recent months. Last month, the medical expert talked to CNN’s Jake Tapper about Trump’s December 17 White House address, which he said “was delivered with a manic cadence, almost a frantic cadence… And that kind of manic delivery was very, very disturbing.”\n\nHe also touched on Trump’s apparent sleepiness, adding, “It’s jarring to see the president go from basically asleep in the Oval Office to, you know, really this rapid-fire pace during basically a 30 minute speech that he gave in 18 minutes.”\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner responded to Trump’s comments about his high-dose aspirin regimen, calling it “nonsense” and medically unnecessary.\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "New trade tensions as the US and Europe spar over Greenland are the latest catalyst that's sending investors flocking to gold and silver on Tuesday.\n\nGold jumped more than 3% to around $4,740 per ounce, and silver spiked 8% to top $95.20 an ounce. Investors have been rattled by President Donald Trump's latest fight with the European Union over Greenland. Trump has doubled down on his calls for the US to take control of the Danish territory. He said that the US would hit EU countries opposed to his takeover with a 10% tariffs starting on February 1, increasing the import duty to 25% in June if no agreement is hammered out.\n\nEU leaders have discussed hitting back with tariffs of their own.\n\n\"Geopolitical uncertainty has boosted demand for both silver and gold just as they were taking off in near-parabolic fashion,\" David Morrison, senior market analyst at TradeNation, said. \"They have become the havens of choice for investors, and this has been bolstered by recent US dollar weakness. Silver also has a strong back story.\"\n\nMorrison said that the higher their prices rise, the greater the chance the market will see a correction, but with geopolitical uncertainty high and Trump showing no signs of taking steps to ease trade tensions, the rally in metals could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nAs Trump heads to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, investors are watching closely for updates on his trade plans and the fight over Greenland.\n\nWhile gold has surged as a general hedge against macro volatility and geopolitical tensions, silver is up amid a handful of other factors, including a supply squeeze and applications in the AI buildout.\n\nMorrison said previously that the reason silver is outpacing gold is likely due to short supply and the fact that it is a substantially smaller market. Demand for both metals is high, but silver may be the more tempting play for investors as it trades at a lower price per ounce.\n\n\"The prevailing view amongst the bulls is that silver is in short supply, while demand from both investors and industry remains strong,\" Morrison noted. \"And, as with gold, this morning's drop in the US dollar has also added to the general bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nJapanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall.\n\nWhat's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes.\n\nOn Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament.\n\nThe news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation.\n\nAs of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland.\n\n\"These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse,\" David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. \"Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe.\"\n\nRising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nWith yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the \"carry trade.\" Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields.\n\nYields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets.\n\nHow things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday.\n\n\"On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields,\" Boivin and his team wrote.\n\nThere are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too.\n\nFor one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook.",

    "description": "Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio said at Davos that \"capital wars\" could be the result of deficits and trade wars.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio thinks the world could be on the verge of \"capital wars.\"\n\nThe billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder isn't shy about sounding the alarm on economic problems he sees brewing. At this week's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he says Donald Trump's aggressive policies could spark global financial conflict.\n\nThe president looms large over Davos this year, with his threatening rhetoric related to Greenland, which he says the US must control for security reasons.\n\nWhile Trump's latest comments are in focus, Dalio says they're just another part of a troubling trend that could shift the global financial order. Speaking with CNBC at the event, Dalio said the possibility of capital wars represents a threat with widespread ramifications for markets and the economy.\n\n\"On the other side of trade deficits and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio stated. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars. In other words, maybe there's not the same inclination to buy at US debt and so on.\"\n\nIn his view, trade conflicts such as the one playing out between the US and much of the rest of the world, don't actually resolve global imbalances. They do, however, put strong tensions on capital flows, as countries grapple with who is financing deficits and which nations are willing to hold certain assets. In particular, eroding trust in the US could make global investors less willing to lend to the country by buying Treasurys.\n\n\"We know that both the holders of US dollar-denominated debt…and those who need it, the United States, are worried about each other,\" he said. \"If you have other countries who are holding it and they're worried about each other, and we're producing a lot of it, that's a big issue.\"\n\nIf foreign demand slumps, he says the US may be forced to rely on internal measures to provide the funding it needs. This could lead to higher inflation or currency debasement, two factors that would likely reinforce concerns among foreign investors.\n\nDalio also reiterated his positive view of gold as a reserve asset in the event of capital wars. He said that in normal times, gold should account for between 5% and 15% of a well-diversified portfolio.\n\n\"I have been clear for quite a while that I would tilt away from bronze, and I would be tilting toward gold, and have a greater than normal amount of that,\" he said.\n\nIn his 2025 market reflections, though, Dalio said that gold's strong price rally may be a warning for investors and urged caution on what the metal's big rally could mean for the economy in 2026.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump made a stunning denial when he was confronted about the unhinged letter blaming his failure to win the Nobel Prize for his threats to seize Greenland.\n\nMonday saw yet another surreal escalation in the Trump Nobel Peace Prize story. Just days after he yoinked the award from 2025 recipient María Corina Machado, Trump sent a letter to Norway bitterly complaining that he no longer feels “an obligation to think purely of Peace.”\n\nWhy? Because “your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS.”\n\n(The prize is not awarded by the Kingdom of Norway, and Trump has not “stopped 8 wars PLUS.)\n\nThe president held a brief gaggle with reporters just before midnight on Monday after he attended the college football championship game in Miami, during which he was confronted about the letter.\n\nDespite having lobbied relentlessly for the award and accepting an invented FIFA prize in its stead and yoinking Machado’s award and centering a threatening international letter around it, Trump denied caring about the prize:\n\nREPORTER: Can you speak to your letter that you wrote to the Prime Minister, saying that the Nobel Prize influenced your thinking on Greenland?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don’t care about the Nobel prize.\n\nFirst of all, a very fine woman felt that I deserved it and really wanted me to have the Nobel Prize. And I appreciate that.\n\nIf anybody thinks that Norway doesn’t control the Nobel Prize! They’re just kidding. They have a board, but it’s controlled by Norway. And I don’t care what Norway says.\n\nBut I really don’t care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I’ve saved tens of millions of lives.\n\nIf you look at India, Pakistan, just as one, two nuclear powers. You look at so many of the countries that were in a 30, In some cases, a 35-year war, and I got it done.\n\nWe stopped eight wars, and maybe we’ll be stopping a ninth very soon.

    "fullText": "The neofascist tech oligarch was cast out of Trump’s inner circle, but his money and influence are still omnipresent.\n\nLast June, the relationship between President Donald Trump and his top political benefactor, Elon Musk, seemed to be in shambles. Wrapping up his 180-day tenure as a “special government employee,” Musk had stepped down from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which had secured for the world’s richest mogul even greater power (and some very valuable government data). Musk’s close involvement with the agenda of the second Trump administration had prompted critics to call it the “Trump-Musk White House”—but the now-sidelined tech oligarch seemed to have become the same sort of obsolete Trump crony that Rex Tillerson or Mike Pence had been in the wake of Trump’s first term.\n\nDespite all the chaos Musk fomented at DOGE by unleashing a corps of twentysomething engineers to wipe out payrolls and agencies under dodgy AI-driven data raids, he failed to sufficiently handicap the administrative state or nuke government spending as he had pledged to. Trump had also decided not to pick Musk’s close ally Jared Isaacman to be NASA administrator—a key post for a tech oligarch with a bevy of government rocket-launch contracts and aspirations to go to Mars—because of Isaacman’s history as a donor to Democratic political campaigns. Things were getting frosty.\n\nMusk, as is his wont, was posting hysterically late into the night on X. Rather than attacking destitute migrants or trans Democrats, Musk was now targeting Trump, whom he accused of various betrayals. The tech mogul claimed to be especially outraged over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” that vastly expanded government spending while slashing taxes—a measure that Musk saw as a “disgusting abomination” certain to balloon the national debt. Finally, Musk wrote on X, it was “time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nAs the Department of Justice’s dissembling in the ongoing Epstein files farrago has demonstrated, Musk was in some sense correct. But his supposed “really big bomb” had a surprisingly small blast radius. It also seemed to lack the conviction of its poster: Musk eventually deleted the message.\n\nMusk made noise about starting an America Party to challenge Trumpian spending, but it never went beyond a super PAC that seems destined to become another MAGA totem, on course to be folded into the mainstream GOP apparatus. While touting the work of Republican Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian Trump gadfly, Musk has otherwise continued to put his money into top Republican organizations. He gave $15 million to three Republican super PACs just before he threatened to start his America Party.\n\nDespite being a vindictive president with vast powers at his disposal, Trump did nothing to retaliate against Musk after he began speaking out. There was some public bickering, including Trump threatening to “terminate” Musk’s government contracts. The president and some of his allies described Musk as an erratic drug addict. But the Musk-Trump relationship was easily mended, at least as a combined political project. Their handshake reunion at the Charlie Kirk memorial was a reminder of how quickly transactional political relationships can be repaired—and that Trump and Musk, who traded barbs well before the 2024 election, have done this before.\n\nWith an eye toward stopping any blue wave in the 2026 midterms, Musk is continuing to shovel money behind the MAGA electoral juggernaut and other administration priorities. Axios recently reported that Musk attended a meeting with Vice President JD Vance and various Trump advisers to discuss midterm donations and political strategy. Susie Wiles, the influential Trump chief of staff who had recently described Musk as a ketamine addict in an interview with Vanity Fair, was also there.\n\nSo in spite of the public furors that have hounded the Trump-Musk alliance, the deeper alignment of interests is clear. Musk needs government contracts and subsidies—which have amounted to $38 billion to date, according to an exhaustive Washington Post investigation. The Department of Defense and the Space Force need SpaceX’s rocket launch capabilities. Trump and the Republican Party need Musk’s money—after raking in some $290 million of it in the 2024 cycle—and the propagandistic power of X, which shouldn’t be underrated. And no one really needs an overblown public media war (that, given past results, would probably be poorly leveraged by Democrats but might fracture an increasingly fragile MAGA base).\n\nSince Musk left DOGE and implied that the president was a pedophile, his companies have continued to accrue valuable contracts, while SpaceX has cemented itself as the premier space-launch vehicle for an administration that would like to colonize everything from Greenland to outer space. In 2025, SpaceX received contracts from the US Space Force worth more than $6 billion. The Department of Defense continues to use Starlink, SpaceX’s Internet service built on thousands of small satellites crowding low-earth orbit, and handed out at least $200 million in contracts for xAI’s Grok, Musk’s Hitlerian, deepfake-crafting chatbot. That software will soon be integrated into military networks, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth bragged. Other government departments that made deals to use Grok have been slower to roll out the software, citing a need for more testing.\n\nCompared to his colleagues Peter Thiel and David Sacks—both pivotal players in the rise of the tech right and the funneling of massive amounts of cash from Silicon Valley to Republican interests—Musk was late in coming to reactionary techno-fascism. A centi-billionaire who ruled over a large business empire, he was not deeply involved in electoral politics before 2020. That changed thanks to the social, economic, and political upheavals surrounding Covid—as well as the personal ordeal of his daughter Vivian Wilson coming out as trans and publicly disowning him. In response, Musk promptly disowned both social liberalism and democracy itself. He theorized a new public menace that he dubbed the woke mind virus and began setting his sights on controlling public discourse and the highest levels of government. And in his shambolic way, he’s been quite successful at it.\n\nMusk’s behavior may be terribly chaotic and inconsistent, full of impossible promises about technological glories to come and threats to create political organizations that never graduate beyond X posts. But he still has the zeal of the convert and unlimited resources. In his grievances—and in his social and business networks—Musk is firmly enmeshed in the far-right MAGA project underwritten by a new tech aristocracy that has little regard for the basic tenets of electoral democracy. For now, as 2026 approaches, Musk’s pro-Republican donations and rhetoric are already flowing firmly behind the president and his party’s prerogatives. The only question is how far the world’s richest man will go.",

    "fullText": "Inside the big rewards tech titans have reaped from caving to Trump. Plus, a look at the US datacenter boom and the effects of Australia’s social media ban\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, the Guardian’s US tech editor.\n\nOne year ago today, Donald Trump was inaugurated as president of the United States. Standing alongside him that day were the leaders of the tech industry’s most powerful companies, who had donated to him in an unprecedented bending of the knee. In the ensuing year, the companies have reaped enormous rewards from their alliance with Trump, which my colleague Nick Robins-Early and I wrote about last month after Trump signed an executive order prohibiting states from passing laws regulating AI. Trump has sponsored the tech industry with billions in government funding and with diplomatic visits that featured CEOs as his fellow negotiators in massive, lucrative deals.\n\nAs year two of Trump’s second term begins, Silicon Valley’s titans appear poised to enrich themselves even more with the president’s enthusiastic aid.\n\nToday in tech, we’re exploring the political consequences of the expansion of datacenters in the US and Europe as well as taking stock of Australia’s under-16 social media ban.\n\nDonald Trump is worried about datacenters. Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his goal of total deregulation of AI and his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nTrump’s anxiety is evident in two actions last week. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n““We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nAnd then on Friday, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as my colleagues Oliver Milman and Dharna Noor reported over the weekend, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue which has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On Thursday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like the rest of us (Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon). Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters, but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those of the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost of living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stop in the datacenter boom: the Middle East, where energy is cheap but water is not abundant, and India, where the power grid is not as reliable …\n\nLawmakers in the UK and around the world are calling for bans on social media accounts for teenagers and children in the wake of Australia’s successful social media ban for under-16s. My colleague Josh Taylor offers a look at how the ban is playing out in its native country. Despite social media companies reporting millions of accounts deleted in compliance with the ban, the opposition party is questioning its effectiveness:\n\nMore than 4.7m social media accounts held by Australians who platforms have judged to be under 16 years of age were deactivated, removed or restricted in the first days after the ban came into effect on 10 December, the prime minister has said.\n\nDespite the high numbers, the federal opposition, which campaigned for the policy before it was adopted by the government, last week said the ban implementation had “fallen flat”.\n\n“New accounts are being created and the age-verification tools that the government assured Australians would be effective, have proven laughably easy to bypass with some makeup and good lighting,” said the shadow communications minister, Melissa McIntosh.\n\nHe called himself an ‘untouchable hacker god’.

Yields climbed to their highest level in more than four months as \"Sell America\" fears gripped markets amid the latest geopolitical tensions. The US Dollar Index also moved lower.\n\n\"Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries,\" wrote George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank's global head of currency research, in a note on Sunday.\n\nThat exposure highlights a key vulnerability for the US, which depends heavily on foreign investors to finance its debt.\n\nEuropean countries own around $8 trillion of US bonds and equities — almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Deutsche.\n\n\"For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits,\" Saravelos added.\n\nHe pointed out that Danish pension funds were among the first to repatriate capital and cut dollar exposure last year in response to uncertainty over Trump's policies. Saravelos also warned that dollar exposure across Europe remains elevated.\n\n\"In an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially, it is not clear why Europeans would be as willing to play this part,\" Saravelos said.\n\nBeyond currencies, Saravelos said the real risk lies in capital markets as the US is more vulnerable to foreign investors than ever before.\n\n\"It is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,\" he wrote.\n\nThat risk is already starting to be priced in, according to Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The market dynamic we are seeing increasing evidence of is that US assets (including the USD) are now carrying a much higher political risk premium,\" Weston wrote on Monday.\n\nThat shift could push foreign investors to reduce their US exposure and adjust how much dollar risk they hold, weighing on the currency and boosting haven assets like gold, he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed market speculation that Europe could dump its US assets in retaliation for Trump's tariff threat over Greenland.\n\n\"There is no talk in European governments,\" Bessent told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling it a \"completely false narrative.\"\n\n\"It defies any logic, and I could not disagree more strongly on that.\"",

    "description": "President Donald Trump wrapped up his first year in his second term. Here's how inflation, the job market, tariffs, and spending have evolved.",
    "fullText": "The US experienced the smallest job growth outside a recession since 2003 last year, adding just 584,000 jobs.\n\nDraho said overall policy uncertainty, tariffs, immigration, and fears of a recession from months ago have been factors.\n\n\"It's made companies a little more reluctant to invest, to hire, if you're not sure how much of an overall economic drag that tariffs would have,\" Draho said about overall uncertainty. \"So even if your company may not be directly affected by tariffs, just the uncertainty of how this could play out would be a bit of a negative.\"\n\nEconomists and job-market experts have said that the slower job market is unsustainable. Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "description": "Scott Bessent argued Trump is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic.”",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that President Donald Trump wants to annex Greenland in order to keep the U.S. from getting “dragged” into an “attack” on the territory from Russia.\n\nDuring an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker questioned Bessent over why Trump is still seeking to seize Greenland despite the fact that the “leaders of Denmark and Greenland [have said] bluntly, ‘Greenland is not for sale.’”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nWelker asked the question after noting that Trump alluded on Friday he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back his actions regarding Greenland.\n\n“Kristen, if we look for years, for over a century, American presidents have wanted to acquire Greenland,” he responded. “And what we can see is that Greenland is essential to the U.S. national security. We’re building the golden dome, the missile system.”\n\nClaiming that Trump is “being strategic” and is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic,” Bessent said: “We are not going to outsource our national security. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to other countries.”\n\nHe added, “In Trump 1.0, President Trump told the Europeans, ‘Do not build Nord Stream 2. Do not rely on Russian oil.’ And guess what, Kristen? Guess what is funding Russia’s efforts against Ukraine? European purchases of Russian oil. So America has to be in control there.”\n\nPolitics: CNN Panelist Goes Nuclear On Scott Jennings In Viral Post: ‘I’m Probably About To Be Banned’\n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Greenland and hasnot ruled out using military force to obtain it despite pushback from European leaders.\n\nWelker pressed Bessent over how serious Trump is about Greenland and whether his actions have been a part of a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security,” he replied, before adding that “down the road, this fight for the Arctic is real.”\n\n“We would keep our NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack on Greenland from Russia, from some other area, we would get dragged in,” he said. “So better now, peace through strength, make it part of the United States, and there will not be a conflict because the United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world.”\n\n“We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength.”\n\nWelker didn’t let up, urging Bessent to confirm whether Trump has been using a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“Is the goal to get a deal to have enhanced security in Greenland, for example?” she asked.\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Tries To Sweet-Talk Territory Takeover Bid\n\n“The president believes that enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the U.S.,” he replied.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker questioned the White House official over why it’s “necessary [for the U.S.] to take over and annex all of Greenland” despite the fact that “85% of people living in Greenland oppose” the potential move.\n\n“The United States has a base in Greenland. I’ve been talking to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Denmark has given the United States a green light to beef up its security as much as is needed in Greenland. Why not take that route?” she asked Bessent.\n\n“Well, again let’s look back. Denmark has a terrible history with Greenlanders,” he responded. “There were forced sterilizations up until the ’80s or the ’90s. So all of a sudden, now that the U.S. has expressed an interest, there is, you know, this new interest.”\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem: Don't Say ICE Agent Jonathan Ross' Name\n\nClaiming that the “United States needs to be in control to prevent a war,” Bessent added, “And we do not want to get dragged into someone else’s war.”\n\nWelker later brought up that “senior Democrats say there are no pressing threats on Greenland’s security from Russia or China,” before asking Bessent what “evidence” the Trump administration has that there is a “pressing threat.”\n\nShe also noted “the Danish foreign minister says there hasn’t been a Chinese warship in Greenland for a decade.”\n\n“Well, first of all, Kristen, we have asymmetric information. And again, President Trump is being strategic here. What evidence was there that the Russians were going into Crimea? Well, actually there was a lot of evidence that the Russians were going to go into Ukraine,” he responded.\n\nPolitics: Wall Street Journal Flags A Dark Downside To Donald Trump’s Greenland Push\n\nBessent pivoted to placing the blame on the Biden administration. “And Joe Biden said, ‘Well, just take a little bit of it.’ But what we know is that Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the U.S.”\n\n“And it will not need to be defended if it is part of the U.S. The president is trying to avoid a conflict,” he added.\n\nWrapping up their discussion on Greenland, Welker asked: “If the United States were to take Greenland by force, how would that be different than Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”\n\n“Look, I believe that Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States,” he responded.\n\nWatch Bessent’s “Meet the Press” interview below.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Called Out For Falsifying Michael Jackson, Diana Ross Photos In Epstein Files\n\nAnother High-Ranking Republican Can't Help But Praise Mamdani\n\nBessent Says U.S. Food Aid Benefits 'Could' Flow By Wednesday",

    "fullText": "(KRON) — A Bay Area Democratic congressman has added their voice to a growing chorus of people calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked over a letter President Donald Trump sent Norway’s Prime Minister. In the letter, Trump appears to connect his interest in the United States taking over Greenland to being bypassed for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump falsely claims in the letter to Norway’s PM Jonas Gahr Støre, adding, “although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nCHP begins enforcing English language rule for truckers\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government but rather by a five-person committee chosen by the Norwegian parliament.\n\n“Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Støre said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump’s letter continued, “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”\n\n“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” Trump continued.\n\nThe letter revived calls similar to those heard during the first Trump administration for using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. The 25th Amendment pertains to what happens if the president or vice president becomes incapacitated — either mentally or physically — and is unable to fulfill their duties.\n\nUnder the amendment, members of the president’s cabinet could legally remove him from office if they do not believe he is fit to lead.\n\n“Trump’s new gigantic temper tantrum over Norway is deep into 25th Amendment territory,” wrote Rick Wilson of the Lincoln Project on X.\n\n“25th Amendment. Now,” tweeted former Republican congressman Joe Walsh.\n\n“Invoke the 25th Amendment,” tweeted U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).\n\nEast Bay Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore) simply tweeted “25,” along with a copy of the letter.\n\nNo member of Trump’s cabinet has signaled any intention of removing President Trump from office.",

Indiana vs. Miami would be the 12th college football game he has attended since he was elected to his first term in 2016, and it would be the eighth he's attended as a sitting president.\n\nIn addition to attending the Army-Navy Game in December, Trump attended a Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions late in the NFL season and even made an appearance in the Fox broadcast booth. Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

    "fullText": "Mr. Tariff’s eponymous policy is causing Americans more harm than good.\n\nContrary to President Donald Trump’s favorite economic claim, U.S. import tariffs are almost exclusively paid for by Americans, new research has found.\n\nThe study, published on Monday by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, reports that American consumers and importers bear 96 percent of the burden from Trump’s aggressive tariff policy.\n\nTrump, 79, has spent the majority of his second term boasting that his tariffs are bringing in billions in revenue from other nations.\n\n“The tariffs are an own goal,” Kiel Institute Research Director and a co-author of the study, Julian Hinz, said. “The claim that foreign countries pay these tariffs is a myth. The data show the opposite: Americans are footing the bill.”\n\nThe research examined over 25 million shipment records for U.S. imports between January 2024 and November 2025, totaling nearly $4 trillion in value, and found that foreign exporters paid only about four percent of the tariff burden, while U.S. buyers absorbed the rest.\n\nInstead of taxing foreign producers, the tariffs serve more as a domestic consumption tax, the report says, predicting that American consumers will face higher prices going forward.\n\nThe data showed that rather than countries reducing their prices to offset the tariffs, they reduced their shipping to the U.S.\n\n“We compared Indian exports to the US with shipments to Europe and Canada and identified a clear pattern,” Hinz said. “Both export value and volume to the US dropped sharply, by up to 24 percent. But unit prices—the prices Indian exporters charged—remained unchanged. They shipped less, not cheaper.”\n\n“Tariffs ultimately disadvantage everyone,” he added.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told the Daily Beast: “The average tariff imposed by America has increased by almost tenfold under President Trump, and inflation has continued to cool from Biden-era highs.”\n\n“The Administration has consistently maintained that foreign exporters who depend on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market, will ultimately pay the cost of tariffs, and that’s exactly what’s playing out,” Desai said.\n\nTrump’s obsession with tariffs has heightened global tensions throughout his second term, as his unpredictable threats and follow-through have led to volatile market conditions.\n\nIn a lengthy post to Truth Social on Saturday, the president threatened a 10 percent import tax against eight European nations that have opposed his takeover of Greenland, which would take effect on February 1.\n\n“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to rule on the legality of Trump’s global tariffs, to which Trump said the U.S. would be “SCREWED” if the court did not rule in his favor.",

Both designs were reportedly seen Saturday on the heads of protesters in Nuuk and Copenhagen.\n\nAll profits go to support a Greenlandic children's charity, Schøtt said.\n\nOther riffs on the original MAGA phrasing have also cropped up in the first year of Trump's second term, with hats saying \"Make America Gay Again,\" \"Make NATO Great Again,\" and \"Make America Normal Again\" available from various shops online.",

    "fullText": "A favorite tool of President Donald Trump has been costing Americans, according to new study.\n\nThe brunt of US tariffs — 96% — have been paid by US buyers, research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, found, while about 4% of the tariff burden was paid by foreign exporters.\n\n\"American importers and consumers bear nearly all the cost,\" the researchers said of the tariffs.\n\nThe study, published Monday, said that the $200 billion increase in customs revenue that the US government raised in 2025 was a \"tax paid almost entirely by Americans.\"\n\nThe research contradicts Trump's messaging that tariff costs would not be paid by Americans, but by other countries and overseas exporters. The president's aggressive tariff policy launched last year placed additional duties on dozens of trade partners, including China, India, and the European Union.\n\nThe Kiel Institute study examined more than 25 million shipment records, worth nearly $4 trillion, between January 2024 and November 2025. The researchers found that there was a \"near-complete pass-through\" of the tariffs.\n\n\"US import prices rise nearly one-for-one with tariffs, while trade volumes contract,\" the study said.\n\nThe findings echo other research that has found Americans are paying for tariffs, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America also said last year that Americans were the ones paying for the tariffs.\n\nThe Kiel study said American importers and wholesalers are first hit by the tariff cost, followed by manufacturers and retailers, all of which must choose whether to absorb the tariff or pass it on to their customers. American consumers are then hit by increased prices, both on imported goods or American-made products that use foreign inputs. There's been more limited availability of goods in the US, the researchers found.\n\nTrump has continued to use tariffs, saying on Saturday that he would impose additional tariffs on Denmark and other European countries unless they agree to a deal that would transfer Greenland to the US.\n\nMany of Trump's tariff policies could also be undone. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of a host of Trump's tariffs that were instituted under an emergency national security law. Trump has said the US would be \"screwed\" if the tariffs are overturned.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide.\n\nOn Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.\n\nAsked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\".\n\nThe US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.\n\nTrump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949.\n\nAsked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\"\n\nTrump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\"\n\nDenmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.\n\nHowever, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.\n\nDanish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\".\n\n\"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\"\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic.\n\nThe European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".\n\n\"But trades threats are not the way to go about this,\" Kallas added. \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"\n\n'Europe is at a total loss': Russia gloats over Greenland tensions\n\n'Europe won't be blackmailed,' Danish PM says in wake of Trump Greenland threats\n\nFaisal Islam: Trump's Greenland threats to allies are without parallel\n\nIt comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.\n\n\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" Støre added.\n\nTrump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say.\n\n\"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nThe joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation \"to support various long-planned Norad activities\", and said they had been coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed.\n\nSimilar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year.",

    "fullText": "With the Trump administration recently expanding its travel ban to 39 countries and suspending visa processing for 75 in total, multiple countries have responded with travel and visa bans for Americans.\n\nThe African nations of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali have all stopped issuing visas for Americans in what they describe as a reciprocal move, given the treatment of their citizens.\n\nAt the start of the month, Mali's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation put out a statement saying that U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nThe South Asian nation of Pakistan was included in the list of nations for which the U.S. State Department will pause processing of all immigrant visas as of Jan. 21.\n\nAlthough the move is not immediately tied to the Trump administration's actions, Pakistan is, in turn, making it more difficult for Americans to visit by suspending its \"visa prior to arrival\" program, Visas News reported. The program allowed citizens of 125 countries to apply for permission to enter easily online.\n\nFrom August 2024, citizens of countries like the United States, Canada and most European and Asian nations could apply for a 90-day tourist or business visa for free by submitting their passport information and trip details through a government portal.\n\nTravelers looking to come to the country were the first to notice that the \"Pak ID\" mobile application now directs applicants to select a traditional visa category for which they have to pay $35 USD for a single entry of up to three months (the prior visa allowed for multiple entries) and will take up to seven business days to be processed.\n\nCitizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have to pay a higher $60 fee for reasons not expanded upon. The Pakistani government has not released an official statement on the change or provided any information on whether the simplified application will ever be brought back.\n\nIn August 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif classified \"this easing of the visa regime [as a way to] help make Pakistan an attractive destination for investments and tourism.\"\n\nThe country sees significantly less tourism interest than neighboring India and has over the last half-decade made several efforts to draw in international visitors.",

    "fullText": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche makes clear that the Department of Justice won’t look into the death of Renee Good—but that won’t stop Minnesota from investigating.\n\nIt’s hard to be shocked by anything the Trump administration does. But when Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News Sunday that the Department of Justice will not investigate the actions of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed Renee Good on January 7, I’ll admit to a moment of shock.\n\n“What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans, because it was recorded when it happened,” Blanche told anchor Shannon Bream. “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody or putting his life in danger, we never do…\n\n“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here…. We are not going to bow to pressure from the media, from politicians. So no, we are not investigating.”\n\nBREAM: Is the FBI conducting an investigation into the ICE agent who shot Renee Good?\n\nBLANCHE: What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans because it was recorded. We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here. We are not… pic.twitter.com/FIQVVavJhq\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, however, was not surprised. “No, I wasn’t shocked, because this is what we’ve been hearing on the ground for days,” he told me Monday morning. “I was glad to hear him say it, because we can bring it to a court.”\n\nEllison and Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty have promised to investigate Good’s killing, but the Justice Department has refused to share the evidence it has collected. “But if they’re not investigating? How do they justify not giving us shell casings, the cars [Good’s and Ross’s], the photos?”\n\nBlanche did get one fact right on Sunday: “Millions of Americans” have indeed seen the footage of Ross shooting Good at close range—and most of them think the ICE agent was in the wrong. An astonishing 82 percent of people polled by Quinnipiac said they’d seen video of the incident, and a majority said Ross was at fault; his life was never “in danger.” Several painstaking New York Times analyses examined the many cell-phone videos of the incident—including Ross’s own—and concluded there is no evidence Good’s vehicle ever struck the agent. He shot her at least twice—one shot directly into her left ear—after she had clearly turned the SUV away from him. There’s at least a foot of daylight between the vehicle and the ICE agent as he fires his last shots.\n\n“I think it’s the purest sign that we’ve abandoned procedural justice and are full-on in an outcomes-driven system,” Ellison said. “Blue lives matter, until they’re upholding the democratic transfer of power [on January 6]. This is a clear hallmark of fascism.”\n\nBlanche said this the same weekend that we learned that Good was still alive when paramedics reached her—not breathing, and with an erratic pulse, but a pulse nonetheless. At least 15 minutes earlier, moments after the shooting, a neighborhood doctor approached ICE agents and asked if he could check her pulse, and he was turned away. “I’m a physician!” he told them. “I don’t care,” the agent replied. I’d like to know that agent’s name and position. His actions merit investigation, too.\n\nNot only is the DOJ refusing to investigate Ross, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem instructed CBS’s Margaret Brennan not to even say his name on the air. “Don’t say his name! I mean, for heaven’s sake, we shouldn’t have people continue to dox law enforcement.”\n\n“His name is public,” Brennan replied. “I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said,” our puppy-killing cabinet secretary insisted.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\n“Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It’s disgusting,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. “Walz and Frey – I’m focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It’s a promise.”\n\nOn Sunday, Blanche told Bream, “You saw the Governor and the Mayor actively encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE. That is not allowed under our law… That’s what we’re looking at.”\n\nLast week, at least 10 Justice Department attorneys resigned because of the department’s failure to investigate Ross and the pressure to investigate Becca Good. Six came from the local US Attorney’s office, which also objected to shutting out local law enforcement and prosecutors from probing the shooting.\n\nNevertheless, Ellison says his office and Moriarty’s are already investigating the shooting, interviewing witnesses, and collecting evidence through an online portal. While some analyses hold that it’s tough for state officials to prosecute a federal agent, Ellison insists otherwise. “No, it isn’t,” he told me. “No, it isn’t. All cases prosecuting law enforcement are difficult,” he acknowledged, but “to say the states have to abandon their power to maintain order in their state? We have the legal right to prosecute and the legal right to investigate.”\n\nThough Ellison said he wasn’t “shocked” by Blanche’s brazen assertion that the Justice Department isn’t investigating Ross, he did admit it was proof that “we are in another kind of moment.” Before Trump, he said, the Justice Department “would have at least done some kind of investigation, assembled a grand jury,” while in the end likely clearing the agent. The notion that the administration no longer has to even pretend to follow the law—Trump last week said only his own “morality” constrains him—puts is in “dangerous” territory, he said.\n\n“The big danger is thinking there’s going to be some ‘snapback’ moment,” he added. “There will not be one that we don’t ourselves create.”",

    "title": "The Stranger King of Venezuela: The Anthropology of Trump's American Colonialism",
    "description": "An anthropological lens on Trump's American Colonialism and the MAGA movement",
    "fullText": "This essay was originally published on Substack. To see the original, or to comment on the piece, click here\n\nIn this essay I’d like to introduce you to the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins’ work on kings, and how it can help us to understand not only the relationship of Venezuelans to Trump, but also the relationship between US Americans and Trump. Sahlins was the doctoral supervisor of the late David Graeber, who is one of my inspirations. Let’s begin with a review of one of Sahlins’ core concepts.\n\nReach back into history, and you’ll find mythological tales of the Stranger King repeated across different cultures.\n\nThese Stranger King stories have a common structure. They are generally set in some troubled ancient regime in which a local despot rules, surrounded by bickering elites. The despot finds himself challenged by a foreign stranger with mysterious, even supernatural, origins. The stranger is often young, handsome and violent, and has a willingness to bend societal norms (or step outside of them). The despot tries to outwit or outfight the newcomer, but is defeated by their trickery or sheer force. The outsider usurps the power and founds a new kingdom.\n\nThere are many examples of the Stranger King myth. Anthropologists have found them in Polynesia, Melanesia, Sulawesi and the East African Rift Valley, and Classicists can find many examples in Greek and Roman mytho-histories. See, for example, this overview by Olaf Almqvist in which he demonstrates the stranger-king credentials of rulers like Aeneas, Pelops, Cyrus the Great, and Sargon of Akkad (even the mythical founder of Rome - Romulus - has a Stranger King vibe).\n\nIn fact, dynasties will often seek to trace their origins back to an ancient Stranger King. For example, the 16th century Mexica ruler Moctezuma reportedly said that he descended from a lineage of “strangers who immigrated hither from a very distant land”1.\n\nIf we talk about Stranger Kings, however, we also have to talk about the legendary anthropologist Marshall Sahlins (1930-2021), who took time to analyse them. His writing on Stranger Kings began in 1982, but his last work on the topic was a collaboration with the late David Graeber in 2017, in a book called On Kings (you can find an open access version of it here). In it, Sahlins and Graeber note some key features of the Stranger King:\n\nIn some ways this is a more sophisticated take on the ‘might is right’ concept. The stranger king might be monstrous, but by stepping outside of normal rules, he creates a mystique, a sense that he has access to powers beyond the ordinary world, and this can become a source of legitimacy.\n\nEqually important, however, according to Sahlins, is that the Stranger King enters into some kind of social contract with the conquered people.\n\nNot only will the woman domesticate the otherwise dangerous outsider, but local elites see opportunities to reform themselves around the Stranger King, seeing in this external power the potential to overcome their own internal divisions or turmoil.\n\nSo, while Stranger King myths might involve heroic, violent, or otherworldly power grabs, they aren’t necessarily stories of straightforward conquest. In fact, they are often stories of usurpation, and Sahlins notes that this pattern actually occurs in various, fairly recent, historical situations.\n\nThis framing of Stranger Kings gives us a more multi-faceted lens through which to view colonisation, because, in the words of Sahlins:\n\nThe take-away point is that colonists are seldom experienced in black-and-white terms, precisely because they often arrive into the already grey context of pre-colonial politics, with different sections of an indigenous population - with different agendas - seeing in them different things.\n\nAt this point it’s important to flag up that colonists always have a vested interest in claiming that they are warmly welcomed by the local population. European colonists, for example, imagined themselves as ‘bringers of light’ on a mission to ‘civilize savages’ living in a ‘primitive’ state of turmoil and godlessness. That said, anti-colonial narratives face the opposite problem, in that they can overemphasise the lack of agency in a colonised population. Sahlins’ discussion of Stranger Kings highlights the ambiguity in foreign takeovers, because the arrival of the violent outside ‘King’ might present opportunities for local elites, who may be prepared to collaborate with, or take a chance on the external power. They may see certain uses in the distant, aloof, strangers, who don’t seem to be subject to the same rules of engagement as the locals are.\n\nThis approach was applied by David Henley, for example, when he found evidence that the indigenous Minahasa on Indonesia found a certain usefulness in the 17th century Dutch East India Company, in particular because Stranger Kings tend to have “aloofness from local rivalries” and an “ability to provide relatively impartial conflict resolution”. The Dutch East India Company was unambiguously self-interested, colonial and extractive, but the point is that, rather than being mere meek bystanders to its history, local people had ambiguous entanglements with the corporate giant. They experience the coercive violence of the colonist, but may still take a gamble on a Stranger King.\n\nOn January 12th 2026, Donald Trump posted a picture of himself on Truth Social, with the tag ‘acting president of Venezuela’. His takeover of the country is unambiguously colonial. Like all colonial ventures, however, there are many who will find ways to justify it.\n\nFor example, the conservative press has predictably fixated on the pre-existing dictator - the figure of Maduro - and his spectacular humiliation and overthrow at the hands of a cunning outsider brimming with almost supernatural vitality. There are stories about the jubilation of exiled Venezuelans, weeping with joy and thanking Trump.\n\nThen we have all the stories about the blatant geopolitics of this. Unlike George W. Bush during the Iraq War, Trump has made almost no effort to disguise the fact that the regime change is all about THE OIL. In fact, he’s loudly proclaimed that it’s about the oil. He’s gone out of his way to talk about how US multinationals will literally take over the country. This makes it very easy for the left wing press to point out the very obvious imperial dynamics of this resource grab. Hell, even the centrist and conservative press are struggling to ignore that.\n\nLet’s forget about the global press response, though. Through the eyes of many Venezuelans, we have here all the elements of a potential Stranger King situation. Ok, Trump isn’t a young, handsome challenger, but he certainly is a foreigner who doesn’t feel encumbered by traditional rules. In fact, the blatant impunity of his oil grab adds to the sense of awe and mystique around him, and he has certainly deposed a local despot.\n\nAt the risk of pushing the framework too far, we even find strange echoes of the mythological ‘marriage to the daughter’ element of the traditional Stranger King story: the female power players of Venezuela, like Delcy Rodríguez and Maria Corina Machado, must now domesticate the irascible outsider by entering into deals with him.\n\nCrucially, while it’s true that the US actions have thrown the Venezuelan establishment into turmoil through violence, there already was turmoil in the pre-colonial situation, so this new incursion has simultaneously opened up new opportunities for local elites (and exiled elites), some of whom have long been seeking some way out of the situation. This could be a usurpation, rather than conquest, with potential for elites to strike a new ‘social contract’ with the foreign power.\n\nLet’s take a moment, however, to unpack that loaded phrase, and how it relates to the Stranger King concept.\n\nThe term ‘social contract’ is heavily associated with classic liberal theory, and classic liberal theory is a heavily abstract way of thinking about the world. When I say ‘liberal’ here, I don’t mean it in the modern US political sense, but rather in the original philosophical sense: early liberal philosophers - like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke - basically started from the assumption that humans are:\n\nFrom that opening position they then describe social formations as collections of individuals who have rationally come together. This sets the scene for mainstream economics, which basically says exactly the same thing, but applies it to economic interactions.\n\nIn the case of standard economists, they imagine individuals ‘choosing’ to ‘come together’ to ‘form markets’, but in the case of our 17th century Hobbes, he imagines rational individuals choosing to come together to form… well… a kind of absolutist monarchy to rule over them (which is partly why Hobbes is often misinterpreted as being ‘illiberal’).\n\nIn his Leviathan (1651) he explains that a monarch is a creation of individuals, who have chosen to give up part of their freewheeling-but-chaotic freedom (which they would have in a ‘state of nature’) in order to enter into a more constraining social contract with a monarch, in which the monarch will provide some structure - like property rights, law and order - so that the individuals can pursue their self-interest without being disrupted by disputes, theft, instability or in-fighting.\n\nIn it’s own context, Hobbes’ Leviathan was an attack on the idea that monarchs derive their power from a god (hence him being accused of atheism), but by describing kings as the secular creation of individuals, he also implied that individuals could dissolve the social contract if necessary, and return to being in a ‘state of nature’.\n\nThis was a politically radical statement to make in the context of 17th century England, but as a generalised account of actual human history it is kinda bullshit, precisely because - like all classic liberal theory - it starts from the ahistorical assumption that humans are individuals and that social formations are ‘chosen’. In reality, every person in history has always been born into an existing social context (aka. societal enmeshment always precedes any perception of being an individual, rather than the other way around) and it’s only in edge cases that we find a random collection of fully-grown adults who are somehow untethered and able to explicitly make some new ‘social contract’ with each other (for example, the only time I’ve ever experienced a ‘social contract’ was when I became naturalized as a British citizen, and - in the ceremony - was given a literal list of my rights and obligations, but of course no British-born person has ever seen this, and none of them ever ‘chose’ to ‘enter into’ the contract).\n\nStill, the edge cases are important, and in many ways Stranger King myths describe one type of edge case. In a pre-existing society in a state of turmoil, it is possible for a foreign ruler to appear as a type of ‘Leviathan’ figure that can be ‘contracted’ with by allowing them to usurp. This might make some kind of rational sense to people entangled in an otherwise intractable conflict, who can dissolve some previous entanglement by jumping ship to the new one.\n\nThis is not to say that this will work out for the people involved, but this does help us to move past binary perspectives on the current Venezuela situation. On the one hand, I find Trump to be an obnoxious narcissist - and he’s now upping the stakes to being an unapologetic coloniser too - but I can still understand the gamble being taken by, for example, a Venezuelan exile who agrees to grant some leeway to him.\n\nLet’s conclude by going one layer deeper. Perhaps the Stranger King myth is crucial to the entire Trump show, beyond his current Venezuelan adventures.\n\nThink about it. In the run-up to his political campaigns, Trump has always presented himself as some kind of heroic outcast - a prodigal son in exile, shunned by The Establishment. The twist here is that he’s not technically a foreigner in the US, but he fashions himself as a local son that’s estranged from his true home, unfairly misrepresented by the New York Times, mocked by Hollywood, disrespected by Time Magazine.\n\nFrom this starting point, the mythology unfolds. The estranged son returns as a Stranger King with a celestial mandate, on a mission to form a ‘contract with the people’ against the despotic ‘deep state’. This justifies overriding all pre-existing norms, checks and balances.\n\nIn Making Capitalism Bad Again, I noted that at least part of the euphoria that surrounds Trump comes from the fact that he gave permission to people to ignore the cognitive dissonance that characterises liberal versions of capitalism - the sense that you’re supposed to be a Good Boy and a Bad Boy at the same time - and, by taking on the ‘bad boy’ mantle, he indeed appeared as a monstrous outsider not subject to the niceties of the society.\n\nIn presenting himself as above and beyond existing norms, he could take on that Stranger King immunity. Through this lens, actions previously considered reprehensible - like attacking the press, centralizing power into the executive, threatening the judiciary, defunding the universities, sending in the National Guard to quell protests etc - can all be framed as signs that the Stranger King isn’t subject to the rules of the realm, and thereby draws his power from some distant, mystical source. That becomes a sign of his legitimacy in the eyes of his followers.\n\nReturning the Sahlins, the Stranger King often comes to power not through conquest, but by usurpation aided and abetted by a local population who see in them a certain usefulness. There are many people who voted for Trump not because they particularly like him, but simply because they took a chance on him, seeing him as the proverbial Stranger, and ignoring his obvious inconsistencies, hypocrisies and flaws, while focusing on his outsider status, which gives him a quasi-supernatural vibe that may be worth taking a gamble on.\n\nGiven that Trump is heavily narcissistic, however, this Stranger King story probably plays out in his own head. He is now triumphant, yet remains deeply vulnerable, incredibly thin-skinned and increasingly maniacal. The Trump show might fly in 2024, but as time goes by, and as he gets increasingly lost in his own mythology about himself, he loses sight of those that brought him to power.\n\nAs he screws over the US shale gas industry by flooding the US with Venezuelan oil in an attempt to deal with inflation caused by tariffs, or sides with the Big Tech barons who couldn’t give a rat’s ass about the rust belt, or disses the CEO of Exxon Mobil, he makes more and more enemies of those who took that gamble on him. Everyone smiles deferentially at the Stranger King, but it’s entirely possible that they’re all waiting for that moment when a newer, younger, and more handsome stranger sets foot in the land.\n\nThis essay was originally published on Substack.

    "fullText": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is getting the message: He’s vulnerable to the same quick hit that President Trump ordered to pluck Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power and toss him into custody in New York.\n\nThe brazen Jan. 3 raid on Caracas by U.S. forces almost certainly struck more fear into the potbellied dictator than any military drills or aerial shows of force ever could. In doing so, it’s also ramped up the risks of a potential nuclear showdown as Kim goes into panic mode, triggered by the same American president who has routinely boasted of the pair’s “very good relationship.”\n\n“The operation to ‘rendition’ the president of Venezuela demonstrates the capabilities that have to be of concern to North Korea,” says Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council. The word “rendition,” as used by Seiler, is CIA-speak for capturing an enemy operative and sending him elsewhere for prosecution, or even torture and killing.\n\nThe other key word is “decapitation,” which Kim is well aware the Americans have been practicing in annual military exercises for years. “What’s appealing is that decapitation is the quickest way to terminate a conflict,” Seiler, who visited North Korea on negotiating teams before the North cut off all communications after the failure of Kim’s meetings with Trump in 2019, told the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\n“Decapitation would be helpful in trying to deter North Korea,” Seiler believes. “Without Kim Jong Un,” he notes, North Korea would have no leader, no one who would know how to lead its outsized, underfed armed forces of 1.2 million troops, much less anyone in charge of its nuclear program.\n\nKim betrayed his deepest fears of a plot like the fracas in Caracas by authorizing release for North Korean audiences of a film all about the capture of Maduro. The film “Days and Nights of Confrontation,” could not have aired on North Korean state TV at a more propitious moment, days after elite U.S. troops seized Maduro and his wife. The message is clear: what’s to stop the Americans from repeating themselves in North Korea?\n\nThe film epitomizes “the trend of racy, Hollywood-style content aimed at appealing to young people,” says a South Korean website, NK News, that tracks North Korea. “Surely Mr. Kim and his family, including his fiery younger sister Yo-Jong, and his beloved teenage daughter, Ju-ae, would make great targets.” In one fell swoop the Americans could wipe out the dynasty that Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-Sung, founded when the Soviet Union installed him as leader of the northern half of the divided Korean peninsula after the Japanese surrender in 1945.\n\nCapturing Kim is not a new idea for American “rendition” experts.\n\n“Some White House aides believed his death would paralyze his country,” writes Joel Wit, who also joined negotiating teams to North Korea, inspecting the nuclear site at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang after North Korea signed an agreement in 1994 to stop producing nukes. “Go get Kim Jong Un, we were postured to do that,” says Wit in his tell-all book, Fallout: The Inside Story of America’s Failure to Disarm North Korea. One official is quoted as saying: “Everyone, including the North Koreans, knew killing him as part of the war plan.”\n\nMaybe the U.S. would have to marshal more than the 150 or so aircraft, and a few hundred troops, including the U.S. Army’s elite Delta Force, that were needed to grab Maduro, but Kim is well aware his family and entourage could be hustled aboard a helicopter bound for an American warship long before the Russians and Chinese could respond in support of North Korea’s military establishment, ill-fed, ill-trained and not at all ready to leap to their leader’s instant defense.\n\nIf capturing Kim sounds like mission impossible, consider his frequent appearances inspecting industrial and agricultural projects, reviewing troops, and presiding at ceremonies. He also shows up periodically at missile launches, perhaps the best time of all to catch him just as he’s making a show of pressing the button. The Americans, moreover, are steeped in the knowledge of what it will take to get him. U.S. forces have been training for years to go after him. Annual U.S.-South Korean exercises once routinely wound up with a mock “decapitation” of “the North Korean leader,” without explicitly naming Kim.\n\nThe U.S. command in Korea dropped the word “decapitation” from the war games in deference to their South Korean ally, who reminded them such language might not help in attempts at fruitless talks with the North Koreans, who now refuse to talk anyway. The word is gaining currency again with Maduro’s capture—while raising the question in Pyongyang of who might come next on the American hit list.\n\n“North Korea’s Kim expected to cling to [his] nuclear security blanket after Venezuela,” blared one headline in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. “The United States’ decapitation operation against Venezuela will reinforce North Korea’s nuclear ambitions,” read another. That warning should prompt Trump to act quickly to get rid of a nuisance who’s been plaguing the region for years with bombastic harangues, threatening his enemies with a nuclear holocaust while his own people suffer from hunger and disease.\n\nFlights of heavy American bombers do little or nothing to remove the threats posed by America’s foes. Kim knows he can laugh off another aerial show of intimidation or a useless meeting with Trump. The threat of a Maduro-style capture is far more effective. Kim’s worst fear is that the Americans, after rehearsing “decapitation” for years, will decide it’s time to finally put their plan into effect, stifling Asia’s leading terrorist just as suddenly as they whisked Maduro and his wife off to jail in New York.",

    "description": "The message was sent to the Norwegian prime minister, who has no control over how the Nobel Committee awards its prizes. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, not Norway.",
    "fullText": "Stock markets went into a global selloff this morning as world leaders at Davos woke up to the news that U.S. President Trump had written to the prime minister of Norway to say that his repeated threats to take over Greenland were based on the fact that he didn’t win the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize … I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,” Trump’s message to Jonas Gahr Støre said. “The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.”\n\nThe Norwegian government has no control over how the Nobel Committee awards its prizes. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, not Norway.\n\nLate last night, Trump posted again on social media, “NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”\n\nTraders, dismayed by the prospect of a renewed trade war between the U.S. and Europe, reacted by driving down equities all over the world.\n\nS&P 500 futures were down 1.12% this morning—an unusually steep drop. The last session closed flat. (Markets in the U.S. are closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.) The STOXX Europe 600 fell 1.25% in early trading, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.49% before lunch. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.65%. China’s CSI 300 was flat. India’s NIFTY 50 was down 0.42%. Bitcoin declined to $93K. The only major national index having a good day was South Korea, where the KOSPI rose 1.32%.\n\nGold, the traditional safe-haven investment, hit a new record high of $4,673.4 on the Comex continuous contract.\n\nWall Street’s analysts broadly agree that President Trump’s repeated threats to force Denmark to “give back” Greenland and to impose an escalating series of trade tariffs on the U.K. and E.U. if those countries don’t comply are bad for equities globally. They differ only in their assessment of how bad this will get.\n\nING’s Carsten Brzeski and Bert Colijn told clients, “Overall, we can only repeat our earlier estimates that additional tariffs of 25% would probably shave 0.2 percentage points off European GDP growth. However, this model-based estimate definitely falls short in capturing the full impact of new uncertainty and geopolitical tensions as a result of escalated tensions.”\n\nThey also cautioned, “As has been the case before, it is not exactly clear how this will work out as there has been no official communication from the White House, yet, just Trump’s announcement on social media.”",

And no, it wasn't by private jet.)\n\nYour immediate reaction to Davos might be a massive eye roll. Davos has gotten a reputation in recent years as a gathering of the elite who are out of touch with everyday people.\n\nThis year, though, some of the biggest topics at Davos will impact everyone. You can follow everything that's going on in our live blog and with our special Davos newsletter.\n\nTrump: In all honesty, the conversation around Davos largely starts (and arguably ends) with the president's appearance on Wednesday. He famously skipped attending the event in person last year (he had just been inaugurated). Instead, he offered a blistering virtual address that largely attacked the rest of the world.\n\nThis time, he's coming with a big contingent, and it's the talk of the town. He's already said a focus of his speech will largely be affordability, interestingly choosing a US-specific issue on the global stage. (It is America First, after all.)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is also coming to town. He plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure. It's another example of the ever-evolving future of capitalism, a topic we've been closely covering this year.\n\nTariffs: Tariffs have been a staple of Trump's second term, and they don't appear to be going anywhere. Their impact is also felt worldwide, making them a perfect fit for the global Davos crowd.\n\nTheir latest iteration is a threat Trump is wielding against countries that oppose his plan to take over Greenland. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said controlling Greenland is actually about Trump trying to avoid conflict.\n\nAI: You didn't think you'd get through this without an AI mention, did you? Last year, the word of the conference was \"agentic AI.\" This year it feels like three letters will be top of mind: ROI. The bets have been placed, and they are big, but what is AI doing for companies?\n\nAlso expect some chatter about how the tech is affecting workforce headcounts.",

When can they expect those?\" Times reporter Katie Rogers asked.\n\n\"I did do that? When did I do that?\" Trump said. \"Yeah, I'm thinking. Well, I did $1,776 for the military.\"\n\nWhen Tyler Pager, another Times journalist, followed up, asking when the checks would come, Trump replied that \"the tariff money is so substantial.\"\n\n\"That's coming in, that I'll be able to do $2,000 sometime,\" Trump said. \"I would say toward the end of the year.\"\n\nIn November, Trump posted on Truth Social proposing a $2,000 payout to all US citizens with low or middle incomes, because the government is \"taking in so much money\" from tariffs. According to a recent Supreme Court filing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimated that the federal government may have collected around $1 trillion in tariffs.\n\n\"People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!\" Trump posted on Truth Social on November 9. \"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.\"\n\nEven if the Supreme Court doesn't rule his tariffs enacted under emergency powers unconstitutional in its coming decision, revenue generated by the duties may be spread too thin for a payout to Americans.\n\nLater in the interview with the Times, Trump said that the tariff revenue will go toward reducing federal government debt and funding national defense.\n\nAccording to the Treasury, the national debt as of January is around $38.40 trillion, and rose by $2.17 trillion in 2025. If Bessent's estimate on tariff revenue is correct, the total amount collected over the past year would cover less than 50% of the increase in debt.\n\nTrump also recently called for increasing the defense budget to $1.5 trillion for the fiscal year 2027. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the move would add $5.8 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump has promised or suggested a number of payouts to Americans in his second term, including a $5,000 DOGE check, a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers with perfect attendance during the government shutdown, $1,000 to Trump Accounts for children who are citizens, and a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for active military members.\n\nAs for whether Trump even has the power to issue the checks, Congress, not the presidency, has the power of the purse and can make those appropriations.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

Let's get loud!\"\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny has already been announced as the headline act for the Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nHis appearance polarised opinion as he had said in an interview with i-D magazine he was avoiding the US on his world tour out of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents might conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nResponding to Bad Bunny's booking for Super Bowl, Trump said on NewsMax's Greg Kelly Reports: \"I've never heard of him. I don't know who he is.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 60 takes place in Santa Clara, California on February 8.\n\nTrump attended last year's Super Bowl, where he saw the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles, but it is not yet known if he will be present this year.\n\nNotable half-time performances in recent years have included Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

The ⁠U.S. has repeatedly recognised that Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nTrump concluded his message to Stoere with typical ebullience.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO ⁠should do something for the United States.

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s made the stunning move, late Saturday, to snub GOP Senator Bill Cassidy (LA) and instead back his would-be primary opponent.\n\nIn a Saturday night Truth Social post, the president announced his support for Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA) to take on Cassidy in the primary.\n\n“Highly Respected America First Congresswoman, Julia Letlow, of the wonderful State of Louisiana, is a Great Star, has been from the very beginning, and only gets better!” Trump wrote. “I am hearing that Julia is considering launching her Campaign for the United States Senate in Louisiana, a place I love and WON BIG, six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024!”\n\nHe added, “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!”\n\nCassidy has bent over backwards to try to get back in Trump’s good graces since voting to convict him in his second impeachment trial in 2021. Most notably, the senator — who is a licensed physician — cast the crucial vote to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary. Since then, Cassidy has criticized Kennedy’s stance on vaccines on numerous occasions\n\nIn response to Trump’s snub, Cassidy posted on X, “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”\n\nI'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\n\n— Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@BillCassidy) January 18, 2026\n\nThe move is likely to complicate the GOP’s slender 53-47 majority in the Senate. Already, outgoing Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) have proven to be tough votes for Republican Senate leadership to secure on various measures. The New York Times reported that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) pushed Trump to consider the potential ramifications on future votes by opposing Cassidy, but to no avail.\n\nThe post Trump Spurns GOP Senator — Gives ‘Complete and Total Endorsement’ to His Likely Primary Foe in Shocking Move first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure. It is yet to be seen if he will address the matter at Davos.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump announced the audacious capture of Nicolás Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., he portrayed the strongman’s vice president and longtime aide as America’s preferred partner to stabilize Venezuela amid a scourge of drugs, corruption and economic mayhem.\n\nLeft unspoken was the cloud of suspicion that long surrounded Delcy Rodríguez before she became acting president of the beleaguered nation earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Rodríguez has been on the radar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for years and in 2022 was even labeled a “priority target,” a designation DEA reserves for suspects believed to have a “significant impact” on the drug trade, according to records obtained by The Associated Press and more than a half dozen current and former U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nThe DEA has amassed a detailed intelligence file on Rodríguez dating to at least 2018, the records show, cataloging her known associates and allegations ranging from drug trafficking to gold smuggling. One confidential informant told the DEA in early 2021 that Rodríguez was using hotels in the Caribbean resort of Isla Margarita “as a front to launder money,” the records show. As recently as last year she was linked to Maduro’s alleged bag man, Alex Saab, whom U.S. authorities arrested in 2020 on money laundering charges.\n\nThe U.S. government has never publicly accused Rodríguez of any criminal wrongdoing. Notably for Maduro’s inner circle, she’s not among the more than a dozen current Venezuelan officials charged with drug trafficking alongside the ousted president.\n\nRodríguez’s name has surfaced in nearly a dozen DEA investigations, several of which remain ongoing, involving agents in field offices from Paraguay and Ecuador to Phoenix and New York, the AP learned. The AP could not determine the specific focus of each investigation.\n\nThree current and former DEA agents who reviewed the records at the request of AP said they indicate an intense interest in Rodríguez throughout much of her tenure as vice president, which began in 2018. They were not authorized to discuss DEA investigations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe records reviewed by AP do not make clear why Rodríguez was elevated to a “priority target,” a designation that requires extensive documentation to justify additional investigative resources. The agency has hundreds of priority targets at any given moment, and having the label does not necessarily lead to being charged criminally.\n\n“She was on the rise, so it’s not surprising that she might become a high-priority target with her role,” said Kurt Lunkenheimer, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who has handled multiple cases related to Venezuela. “The issue is when people talk about you and you become a high-priority target, there’s a difference between that and evidence supporting an indictment.”\n\nVenezuela's communications ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe DEA and U.S. Justice Department also did not respond to requests for comment. Asked whether the president trusts Rodríguez, the White House referred AP to Trump’s earlier remarks on a “very good talk” he had with the acting president Wednesday, one day before she met in Caracas with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nAlmost immediately after Maduro’s capture, Trump started heaping praise on Rodríguez — this past week referring to her as a \"terrific person — in close contact with officials in Washington, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe DEA’s interest in Rodríguez comes even as Trump has sought to install her as the steward of American interests to navigate a volatile post-Maduro Venezuela, said Steve Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, a think tank focused on organized crime in the Americas.\n\n“The current Venezuela government is a criminal-hybrid regime. The only way you reach a position of power in the regime is by, at the very least, abetting criminal activities,” said Dudley, who has investigated Venezuela for years. “This isn’t a bug in the system. This is the system.”\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with Trump at the White House Thursday in a bid to push for more U.S. support for Venezuelan democracy.\n\n“The American justice system has sufficient information about her,” said Machado, referring to Rodríguez. “Her profile is quite clear.”\n\nRodríguez, 56, worked her way to the apex of power in Venezuela as a loyal aide to Maduro, with whom she shares a deep-seated leftist bent stemming from her socialist father’s death in police custody when she was only 7 years old. Despite blaming the U.S. for her father’s death, she steadily worked while foreign minister and later vice president to court American investment during the first Trump administration, hiring lobbyists close to Trump and even ordering the state oil company to make a $500,000 donation to his inaugural committee.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped when Trump, urged on by Rubio, pressured Maduro to hold free and fair elections. In September 2018,the White House sanctioned Rodríguez, describing her as key to Maduro’s grip on power and ability to “solidify his authoritarian rule.” She was also sanctioned earlier by the European Union.\n\nBut those allegations focused on her threat to Venezuela’s democracy, not any alleged involvement in corruption.\n\n“Venezuela is a failed state that supports terrorism, corruption, human rights abuses and drug trafficking at the highest echelons. There is nothing political about this analysis,” said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a longtime former DEA agent who led investigations into top Venezuelan officials and is now a managing partner at Elicius Intelligence, a specialist investigations firm. “Delcy Rodríguez has been part of this criminal enterprise.”\n\nThe DEA records seen by AP provide an unprecedented glimpse into the agency’s interest in Rodríguez. Much of it was driven by the agency’s elite Special Operations Division, the same Virginia-based unit that worked with prosecutors in Manhattan to indict Maduro.\n\nOne of the records cites an unnamed confidential informant linking Rodríguez to hotels in Margarita Island that are allegedly used as a front to launder money. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the information.\n\nThe U.S. has long considered the resort island, northeast of the Venezuelan mainland, a strategic hub for drug trafficking routes to the Caribbean and Europe. Numerous traffickers have been arrested or taken haven there over the years, including representatives of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel.\n\nThe records also indicate the feds were looking at Rodríguez’s involvement in government contracts awarded to Maduro’s ally Saab — investigations that remain ongoing even after President Joe Biden pardoned him in 2023 as part of a prisoner swap for Americans imprisoned in Venezuela.\n\nThe Colombian businessman rose to become one of Venezuela’s top fixers as U.S. sanctions cut off its access to hard currency and Western banks. He was arrested in 2020 on federal charges of money laundering while traveling from Venezuela to Iran to negotiate oil deals helping both countries circumvent sanctions.\n\nIn an unrelated matter, the DEA records also indicate agents’ interest in Rodríguez’s possible involvement in allegedly corrupt deals between the government and Omar Nassif-Sruji, a relative of a longtime romantic partner of Rodríguez's, Yussef Nassif.\n\nNassif-Sruji did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment and an attorney for Nassif denied his client was involved in any nefarious activity, pointing out that he hasn't been accused of any crime.\n\n\"He has the utmost respect and confidence in the acting president's vision for Venezuela and believes she is a true patriot who has committed her entire life to the betterment of the Venezuelan people,\" the attorney, Jihad M. Smaili, said in a statement. “The insinuations that Mr. Nassif is currently involved in any untoward relationship with the acting president are false.”\n\nTaken together, the DEA investigations underscore how power has long been exercised in Venezuela, which is ranked as the world’s third most corrupt country by Transparency International. For Rodríguez, they also represent something of a razor-sharp sword over her head, breathing life to Trump’s threat soon after Maduro’s ouster that she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she didn’t fall in line. The president added that he wanted her to provide the U.S. “total access” to the country’s vast oil reserves and other natural resources.\n\n“Just being a leader in a highly corrupted regime for over a decade makes it logical that she is a priority target for investigation,” said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for three decades. “She surely knows this, and it gives the U.S. government leverage over her. She may fear that if she does not do as the Trump administration demands, she could end up with an indictment like Maduro.”\n\nMustian reported from New York.\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has turned to his favorite form of leverage in his effort to annex Greenland: Tariffs.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose on February 1 an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nThe president said he would raise those tariffs to 25% in June if they did not comply. All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.\n\nThe Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.\n\nHiggins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.\n\nHowever, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.\n\n\"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him,\" Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good.\"\n\n\"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "description": "Here are the businesses that Trump's first year back in office have greatly benefitted, and industries that have been hit hard.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's year in office was a mixed bag of blessings and woes for the business world.\n\nLast year began with a lineup of billionaires at Trump's inauguration, all of whom soon saw their net worth diminish after Trump enacted sweeping tariffs aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs.\n\nTheir fortunes soon rebounded, and Trump has been a booster of the tech industry, which continued to grow in 2025.\n\nBusinesses were also often caught in Trump's crosshairs, including Intel, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nFrom the retail sector to the AI industry, here's how different industries fared in Trump's first year of his second term.\n\nThe AI industry continued to soar during the first year of Trump's second term.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the company's AI basket of 34 stocks, which includes Amazon, Cisco, and Apple, saw a 50.8% in share value in 2025, while the overall stock market gained 17.3% and the broader tech sector rose 21.4%, based on the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nWithin the first month of his presidency, Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate, to be led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which he said would be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history.\"\n\nTrump has also been a booster of the tech industry at large — while receiving donations, gifts, pledges for more American manufacturing, and praise from leaders.\n\nHe's had notable visits with CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The US eventually allowed Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China, under the condition that the government gets a cut of the profit.\n\nTrump also rescinded an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden that established a federal framework for AI safety and risk mitigation, and he signed a new order intended to override state-level AI regulations.\n\nAnd after publicly calling for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Trump made a deal for the US to take a nearly 10% equity in the company, which has since seen its stock rise.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump's second year in office in his second term will bring.\n\nConcerns are bubbling under the industry boom. Industry experts fear that an AI bubble burst will bring about a market crash similar to the dot-com crash.\n\nTrump is also warning tech companies that data centers cannot contribute to the affordability crisis by driving up energy bills. Some tech bulls, such as Dan Ives, said that the focus on costs could derail the AI boom.\n\nRetail businesses, large and small, have been hit hard by Trump's first year back.\n\nThe Trump presidency kicked off with a flurry of tariffs, sometimes on some of the country's closest trade partners. Businesses in retail have been struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and some have responded by hiking prices.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that the tariffs had disproportionately affected Main Street and entrepreneurs who make physical products. Several small businesses sued Trump over the tariffs enacted using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nEven if businesses were able to handle tariffs, they were competing for skittish consumers after sentiment sank to a new low in November, based on the Consumer Index by the University of Chicago. Economists have also found that while the wealthy have continued to spend, others have cut back.\n\nNot everything was down. Trump did backtrack on some of his tariffs, and the retail sector did see some growth compared to 2024, according to the ‌Commerce Department's Census Bureau.\n\nDespite Trump's promise to bring blue-collar jobs back to the US and some high-profile plans, like Apple's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically and Nvidia's plans for a US-based supercomputer plant, the manufacturing sector has still not taken off.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, factory employment has dropped by more than 70,000 since April, to 12.69 million as of December, the lowest point since March 2022. The Bureau also estimated that the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs in December alone.\n\nIn May 2025, a month after Trump enacted the bulk of his tariffs, Wells Fargo economists predicted that the duties would not be effective in reshoring manufacturing jobs and that the administration would face an \"uphill battle.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that some small and medium-sized businesses have canceled domestic investment plans due to economic uncertainty stemming from the constantly changing tariffs. The loss of manufacturing jobs also reflects a broader trend of a low-hire, low-fire environment, where businesses freeze in the face of an uncertain environment.\n\nTrump has shown a recent interest in policy around the sector.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, arguing it could make monthly payments more affordable for buyers shut out of homeownership.\n\nHe also recently said that he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes in order to increase the supply of homes. He also announced that he would instruct his \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, without further clarification.\n\nHome prices rose in 77% of metro markets during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest report. Business Insider also previously reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer hit 40 in 2025, up from 31 a decade earlier.\n\nEconomists have thus far commented that neither idea would address the root of the problem, which is a shortage of homes. Trump's tariffs on raw materials may have also contributed to the cost of constructing homes.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing “compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.\n\nThe comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that U.S. forces “will now start hitting land” in Mexico targeting drug cartels, after the dramatic United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nSheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a “cool head,” has sought to placate Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. The early January raid in Venezuela set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.\n\nOn Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed “more must be done to confront shared threats.”\n\nSheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\n\n“There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,” she said.\n\nShe reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.\n\n“The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum and Trump also spoke by phone Monday. Sheinbaum said she again told Trump that U.S. intervention in Mexico was unnecessary.",

    "description": "Worried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.",
    "fullText": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, \n\nWorried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.\n\nTrump doesn’t understand why his approval rating is underwater (and it is, on every issue, in a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released Friday).\n\n“I wish you could explain to me what the hell’s going on with the mind of the public,” he told House Republicans in a speech earlier this month.\n\nLater, he added: “Now, I won’t say, ‘Cancel the election. They should cancel the election,’ because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’”\n\nBut Trump did talk about canceling the election in an interview with Reuters this week. He said Republicans have been so successful that “when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the president was “joking” and “being facetious” about canceling the election.\n\nIf it’s a joke, it’s material he’s been working on for months. Told during an appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last September that Ukraine won’t hold an election during a period of martial law during its war with Russia, Trump expressed some envy.\n\n“So you say during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump said. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that’s good.”\n\nTrump routinely says things that seem like trolls until they don’t. Owning Greenland? Not a joke. However, he seems to have retreated from the oft-repeated idea of an unconstitutional third term.\n\nAnd for the record, unlike Ukraine, the US has held elections in the midst of multiple wars, when the British had invaded in 1812 and when it was at war with itself in 1864. It held elections during world wars when millions of Americans fought overseas in the 20th century as well.\n\nTrump knows that presidents rarely pick up seats in a midterm. His administration has been moving at breakneck speed to change the government because, as his chief of staff famously said, they know that presidents expect to lose power after their first two years. A net loss of just a handful of seats would give control of the House to Democrats, for instance, requiring their buy-in for spending and giving them power to investigate his administration.\n\nThe Constitution requires that a new Congress be sworn in on January 3, 2027. Election Day is set in law, so it is theoretically feasible for Congress to move it, but not to cancel the election. Elections are supposed to be administered by each state, so state governors and legislatures could, in theory, move their own elections to deal with a major disaster, but there’s no precedent for it. To get into the weeds of all of this, read a report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump has also mused about using emergency powers to meddle with elections. He told the New York Times recently that he regrets not directing National Guards to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.\n\nEven the elections he has won, he has said were rigged. There’s still no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, even after all these years of the Trump era.\n\nElection officials say they are thinking very carefully about all of this. Asked about Trump’s musings at an event sponsored by The Atlantic this week, Arizona’s top election official, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said this:\n\n“The fact that we’re running through these scenarios in the first place should tell you something about the health of our democracy,” Fontes added.\n\nTo that end, he would not elaborate on what scenarios they’re preparing for.\n\n“I don’t want to give the bad guys any ideas,” Fontes said.\n\nWhile Trump might fantasize about canceling the election, the reality is that the election system is already changing in some key ways. Some of them may be enormously consequential.\n\nRepublicans have drawn themselves nine more friendly seats across the country, and Democrats have ended up with six, mostly in California. Republicans see additional opportunity in Florida, while Democrats plan a redistricting ballot initiative in Virginia in April. Read more.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides to further gut the Voting Rights Act, Republicans could in theory redraw maps in many other states. Read takeaways from October’s oral arguments.\n\nThe long-term result of more and more political gerrymandering without protections for racial minority-focused districts could be the smothering of minority-party delegations in multiple states, making the House map look increasingly more like the presidential map. Far fewer Democratic districts in Texas. Far fewer Republican districts in California — even though there are millions of both Republicans and Democrats in both states.\n\nWhile much of the effort has been stopped, for now, by courts, Trump’s goal is to exert more executive control over elections that are supposed to be governed by Congress and states.\n\nA federal court on Thursday sided with California against the administration’s demand that the state turn over information on its 23 million voters.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether mail-in ballots that are postmarked by, but arrive after Election Day can still be counted. The decision could have serious consequences for the country’s large scale adoption of mail-in voting in recent years. Trump is a loud skeptic of the practice even though he has personally voted by mail. His executive order would also scramble how states use voting machines, another response to phantom voter fraud that could actually drastically slow down the counting of ballots.\n\nEarly on, his administration scaled back the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, which is meant to helps states guard their election systems from attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled funding for an information sharing network that helped states detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks, as CNN reported last year.\n\nHis Justice Department has rewired the agency’s Civil Rights Division away from its original core mission of civil rights abuses, including those related to elections. One current focus of the division is to help states “clean” voter rolls, although a judge recently ruled that effort was a misapplication of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTrump’s administration has already tried to change how people vote through executive action, and who they vote for through changing maps.\n\nThere’s a lot of time for more gaming the system between now and November, and Trump clearly already has the midterms on the brain.",

    "fullText": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party ahead of this year’s pivotal midterm elections.\n\nThe longtime NBA commentator, who has hinted at a move into politics, unloaded on Trump over how he has handled the presidency so far in his second term, predicting sweeping losses for Republicans if current trends continue.\n\n“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there, you’re about to lose the midterms. You’re going to lose. And you might lose the presidency in 2028, and it’s going to be at the fault of your president, Donald Trump,” the host said in an episode of Straight Shooter with Stephen A. that aired on Thursday.\n\nSmith is among a growing list of prominent voices warning of trouble for Trump as the midterms approach. The GOP holds narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate, leaving little margin for error.\n\nHis voice rising to nearly a shout, the ESPN pundit said Trump is “going to blow it” for the GOP.\n\n“Trump is blowing it! He’s blowing it! He’s going to blow it for himself; he’s going to blow it for the GOP; he’s going to blow it for Congress; he’s going to blow it for the Senate; and he’s likely going to blow it for the White House,” said Smith.\n\n“The man don’t know how to act,” he went on, criticizing the political climate and messaging coming from the White House.\n\n“What you’re hearing about is Gestapo tactics on the part of ICE. What you’re hearing about is, what happened to going after the hardcore criminals and making sure to deport them, as opposed to terrorizing everyday, normal American citizens?”\n\n“What we’re hearing about is chaos, chaos, chaos. And, oh my lord, we don’t need to see this again. We don’t need to see this again. That’s what you’re hearing about. And you’re hearing a president that doesn’t know how to be quiet,” Smith said.\n\nThe ESPN host stopped short of calling Trump self-obsessed, saying he’s like “somebody addicted to carrying a microphone.”\n\n“I, your friendly neighborhood host, is on the air between ESPN and Sirius XM. I am on the air live a minimum of 22 hours a week, a minimum of 45 weeks a year—a year! Ladies and gentlemen, that equates to over 900 hours, and I’ve got nothing on Trump. Not a damn thing! He can’t stop! Every time you turn around, it’s something.”\n\nSmith also pointed to cracks among Trump’s allies.\n\nHe added: “It’s so bad right now. Even the godfather of podcasting, Joe Rogan, who endorsed Donald Trump right before the 2024 election has spoken out about him.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff James Blair has also acknowledged that the GOP faces trouble ahead, while Rep. Nancy Mace has said she’s not confident Republicans will be able to retain control of the House of Representatives in the midterms.\n\nTrump has begged Republicans to win the 2026 congressional midterm elections to stop Democrats from attempting to impeach him.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump this week quietly appointed four new members to the Commission of Fine Arts, one of two federal panels reviewing his plan to build a White House ballroom.\n\nThe Republican president has talked about building a White House ballroom for years, and completing the proposed 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) addition would not only forever alter the public face of the mansion but would stand for decades as a lasting legacy to Trump.\n\nOne of new members is James McCrery, an architect who had led the now $400 million ballroom project until Trump replaced him late last year. The White House has said the project would be financed with private donations — including from Trump himself — and the East Wing has already been demolished to make space for the ballroom.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction until the fine arts panel and a second federal commission give their approval. The four new members were revealed in court papers filed Thursday by a White House official as part of that lawsuit. The White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nThe new appointments would give the Commission of Fine Arts a quorum, or enough members to conduct business at a meeting scheduled for Jan. 22, where consideration of what is being called the East Wing Modernization project is on the agenda. The panel had been scheduled to meet this past week, but could not due to the lack of new members.\n\nThe commission did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe panel normally has seven members but has been unable to meet for months. Trump dismissed six commissioners last fall after the East Wing was torn down. A seventh commissioner, who was the panel’s chair, had earlier resigned after Trump took office last year because their term had expired.\n\nThe White House is tentatively scheduled to formally present the project to the commission on Feb. 19 and March 19, at which time the panel could complete its review, Heather Martin, a deputy assistant to the president, said in the court papers.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has accused the Trump administration of violating federal laws by starting the project before submitting it for independent reviews by the commissions and Congress, as well as the public.\n\nAside from architect McCrery, who had served on the commission as a Trump appointee from 2019-2024, the commission will include Mary Anne Carter of Tennessee; Roger Kimball of Connecticut; and Matthew Taylor of Washington, D.C.\n\nCarter is chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, a position she also held during Trump’s first term. She is a former staffer to Rick Scott, a former governor of Florida and current U.S. senator from the state. Kimball is an art critic and conservative commentator.\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission, the second federal panel with oversight of construction on federal land, including the White House grounds, heard an initial presentation about the ballroom at its meeting on Jan. 8.",

    "description": "The president issued a raft of clemency grants this week, including pardoning a woman he had given relief to once before and a man whose daughter had donated millions to a Trump super PAC.",
    "fullText": "In 2021, a convicted fraudster named Adriana Camberos was freed from prison when President Trump commuted her sentence.\n\nRather than taking advantage of that second chance, prosecutors said, Ms. Camberos returned to crime. She and her brother were convicted in 2024 in an unrelated fraud.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump pardoned both siblings, marking the second time he had opened the prison gates for Ms. Camberos.\n\nTheir pardons were among a handful of clemency grants quietly issued by Mr. Trump on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAmong the other lucky recipients: a man whose daughter had given millions to a Trump-backed super PAC, a former governor of Puerto Rico and a former F.B.I. agent — all of whom had pleaded guilty in a political corruption case.\n\nThe pardons, most of which have not been previously reported, were supported by people with close ties to Mr. Trump’s orbit, including lawyers who had worked for him.\n\nThey continue a trend in which Mr. Trump has used the unfettered presidential clemency power to reward allies and those who have paid his associates or donated to his political operation. The approach stands in contrast to Justice Department guidelines that prioritize the clemency applications of people who have completed their prison sentences or demonstrated remorse and a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe pardons, several of which forgave white-collar crimes and frauds by affluent perpetrators, strike a discordant note with the Trump administration’s announcement that it was suspending federal funding for programs intended to serve poor people in Minnesota in order to root out fraud.\n\nA White House official justified the clemency grants in a statement as rectifying excessive sentences or prosecutions that were politically motivated to target Trump supporters. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the clemency grants on the record, suggested that Mr. Trump made the clemency decisions based on the merits, not whether the recipients had political connections or had made donations to groups he supports.\n\nThree of the recipients were scheduled to be sentenced this month in a political corruption case related to accusations that former Gov. Wanda Vázquez of Puerto Rico had accepted bribes from Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian banker, in 2020.\n\nIn late 2024, while Mr. Herrera was facing felony bribery and other charges in the case, his daughter, Isabela Herrera, donated $2.5 million to MAGA Inc., a super PAC devoted to Mr. Trump and run by his allies.\n\nIn May, her father’s lawyer, Christopher M. Kise, who had served on Mr. Trump’s legal defense team, negotiated an unusually lenient deal with the Justice Department. Under the deal, which was authorized by a top Trump appointee, Mr. Herrera agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor campaign finance charge, disappointing career prosecutors who had pushed for a harsher sentence.\n\nIn July, Ms. Herrera donated another $1 million to MAGA Inc. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump this week pardoned Mr. Herrera, Ms. Vázquez and Mark Rossini, a former F.B.I. agent who had worked as a consultant for Mr. Herrera. All three had pleaded guilty in August to misdemeanor campaign finance charges.\n\nThe White House official denied that Ms. Herrera’s donations had played any role in her father’s pardon. Instead, the official suggested that pardon and the others related to the Puerto Rico case were motivated by a belief that the investigation into the matter was retribution for Ms. Vázquez’s endorsement of Mr. Trump in 2020.\n\nMr. Herrera “is profoundly grateful” to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kise said in a statement.\n\nLawyers for Ms. Vázquez and Mr. Rossini did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs for Ms. Camberos, she was among a number of people granted clemency by Mr. Trump who have been charged with new crimes after receiving a second chance.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nMs. Camberos began serving a 26-month prison sentence in December 2019 for her role in a scheme to sell millions of counterfeit bottles of the caffeinated drink 5-Hour Energy. Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in the final days of his first term after she enlisted two lawyers with connections in his orbit. One of them, Stefan C. Passantino, had been a deputy White House counsel in the first Trump administration. Another, Adam Katz, represented Rudolph W. Giuliani in a defamation case related to his effort to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election.\n\nBut soon after her release from prison, she and her brother Andres embarked on a new fraud, federal prosecutors in California said. The siblings were charged in 2023 in a complicated scheme: They bought consumer goods from manufacturers at a steep discount, purportedly to sell them in Mexico — a legal practice. Instead, prosecutors said, the siblings sold the goods in the United States at higher prices and then committed bank and mail fraud to cover their tracks.\n\nThey were convicted in 2024. In April, Ms. Camberos was sentenced to more than one year in prison — 12 months for the new conviction and additional months for violating her probation on her earlier conviction — and Andres Camberos was given one year of home confinement. Ms. Camberos had begun serving her sentence.\n\nThey were ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution to the companies they defrauded.\n\nThe White House official did not respond to a question about whether the pardon would wipe away the Camberos siblings’ restitution payments, but pardons typically erase financial penalties.\n\nThe siblings’ supporters had argued privately that they were targeted by prosecutors because Mr. Trump had wiped away Ms. Camberos’s sentence from her earlier conviction — a claim echoed by the White House official.\n\nMr. Passantino and Mr. Katz had worked to secure pardons for the siblings, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nThe two lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Marcus Bourassa, another lawyer for Ms. Camberos, said in a statement that his client was wrongfully convicted and is grateful to the President and others for their support.\n\nMr. Katz also had supported clemency for Terren S. Peizer, a former business executive who had been convicted in 2024 of insider trading and sentenced last year to 42 months in prison. Mr. Peizer was also ordered to pay a fine of $5.25 million and forfeit more than $12.7 million. He was pardoned on Friday by Mr. Trump.\n\nDavid Willingham, a lawyer for Mr. Peizer, said in a statement that the case was a “massive overreach” by the government.\n\nAnother statement issued on behalf of Mr. Peizer himself said that “there aren’t enough words to express the gratitude and appreciation I have for the compassion and recognition of this unfair process by the most accomplished president of my lifetime, and perhaps beyond.”\n\nThe White House official said that Mr. Peizer’s case was an example of excessive prosecution and that he had properly disclosed the trades.\n\nAnother finance executive who received a pardon, David Levy, was convicted by a jury in 2019 for his role in a scheme to defraud bondholders while he was the co-chief investment officer of a New York hedge fund. In a statement issued after the conviction, a federal official who oversaw part of the investigation called the verdict “a warning for all the fraudsters out there: No matter how slick you think you are, liars, frauds and cheats never win.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump also signed eight commutations, which cut short sentences but do not necessarily wipe away other penalties related to convictions.\n\nMost went to people convicted of drug offenses, including James P. Womack, the son of Representative Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who is a Trump ally.\n\nThe younger Mr. Womack had pleaded guilty in 2023 to distributing methamphetamine, and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nHis father, who in November cited a family member’s serious medical issue, thanked Mr. Trump in a statement on Friday “for this gracious and thoughtful action.” The commutation, Mr. Womack said, “has allowed my son to be with his family during a profoundly difficult time.”\n\nAnother commutation went to Jacob Deutsch, who had been sentenced to 62 months in prison in 2024 for his role in a mortgage fraud scheme.\n\nHis clemency grant was supported by the Tzedek Association, a Jewish group that was influential in shaping Mr. Trump’s clemency grants and criminal justice policies during his first term.\n\nThe group, which posted an apparent copy of the signed commutation on social media, contended that the sentence was too harsh and thanked Mr. Trump for affirming mercy “as a cornerstone of American justice.”",

    "description": "Trump and a group of northeastern governors are pressuring a major power grid operator to hold a new auction.",
    "fullText": "The AI data center boom is driving up electricity prices. President Donald Trump is leaning on a power company to fix it.\n\nTrump and a group of governors from northeastern states are calling on PJM Interconnection, the nation's largest power grid operator, to hold a new power auction.\n\nThe goal is to allow major tech companies to foot the bill for new power plants. According to a release from the Department of Interior, a \"coalition of leading technology companies\" has committed to funding new generation capacity, though no companies are named.\n\n\"Make no mistake, if PJM, this faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change, and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act, and forced to go at it alone,\" Gov. Josh Shapiro said at an event for the announcement, according to Politico.\n\nThe Trump administration and the governors are also urging PJM to make a series of other changes, according to a Department of Energy fact sheet. Those changes include:\n\nPJM operates in 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest. Representatives for the company were not present at the Friday event.\n\n\"We don't have a lot to say on this,\" PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg on Thursday. \"We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Shields did not immediately commit to the White House's directives.\n\n\"PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. The PJM Board's decision, resulting from a multi-month stakeholder process on integrating large load additions, will be released later today,\" Shields said. \"The Board has been deliberating on this issue since the end of that stakeholder process. We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board's decision.\"\n\nAri Peskoe, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, told Business Insider that it's unclear whether the administration's approach will work.\n\n\"The intent here is correct, which is to appreciate that data centers are driving up prices in PJM, and an attempt to remedy that for consumers,\" Peskoe said. \"It is meant to isolate data centers from the rest of the market, and, in theory, that seems like a workable approach; but these markets are really complicated, and it's hard to predict how this all shakes out.\"\n\nTrump has been making a broader push for tech companies to pay for the electricity consumed by new data centers in a bid to lower energy costs for consumers.\n\n\"My Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that tech companies must \"pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft on Tuesday released a plan that includes asking utility companies to set higher rates for the company in order to keep costs down for consumers. Other major tech companies could follow a similar path.",

    "fullText": "A reporter confronted President Donald Trump Friday afternoon over his acceptance of a gift award that he did not win, asking “Why would you want somebody else’s Nobel Prize?”\n\nTrump has been foreshadowing that he would be honored to accept the Nobel Peace Prize from 2025 recipient María Corina Machado. After reporting that suggested her failure to refuse the prize contributed to Trump’s decision not to support her, Machado told Sean Hannity she’d love to give her award to the president.\n\nMachado and Trump closed the deal on Thursday at the White House, although the honor that goes with the award is non-transferable.\n\nThe president took questions from reporters on the North Lawn of the White House as he made his way to Marine One on his way to Mar-a-Lago, and was asked about his used award:\n\nREPORTER: Yesterday, yesterday you accepted Maria Machado’s Nobel Prize medal. What do you intend to do with it? And why would you want someone else’s Nobel Prize?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, she offered it to me. I thought it was very nice. She said, you know, you’ve had eight wars and nobody deserves this prize more than in history than you do. And I thought that was a very nice gesture. And by the way, I think she’s a very fine woman and we’ll be talking again.\n\nREPORTER: You just called Machado a very nice person. He said the meeting went well. Why align with Delci Rodriguez and the remnants of the Maduro regime and not with Machado who has the support of the Venezuelan people?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired, every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired, and they ended up being ISIS. Instead of just getting down to business, they ended being ISIS, so I remember that.\n\nBut I’ll tell you, I had a great meeting yesterday by a person who I have a lot of respect for.\n\nAnd she has respect, obviously, for me and our country. And she gave me her Nobel Prize.\n\nBut I’ll tell you what, I got to know her. I never met her before. And I was very, very impressed. She’s a really, this is a fine woman.\n\nThe post Trump Confronted to His Face Over Nobel Yoink: ‘Why Would You Want Somebody Else’s Nobel Prize?’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Anthony Scaramucci thinks Trump’s ‘hard-left’ move to cap credit-card fees is because he’s ‘texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani’",
    "description": "The \"mooch\" says it really shows a pivot to \"full nihilism.\" His podcast guest, longtime GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, called it \"darkly hysterical.\"",
    "fullText": "In a provocative assessment of the current political landscape, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci claims President Donald Trump has entered a “full nihilism mode,” evidenced by a recent proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10%. Speaking on his podcast, The Rest Is Politics US, Scaramucci characterized the move as a “hard-left populist” maneuver that aligns more closely with democratic socialists than traditional Republican orthodoxy.\n\nScaramucci suggested the policy shift is so radical it feels as though Trump is “texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani,” referencing recent reporting in Axios that Trump and the recently elected democratic socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, have been texting since they met at the White House in November.\n\n“This is a hard-left populist thing to do,” he said, though he was quick to point out Trump lacks the unilateral authority to implement such a change. He explained such a cap would require congressional approval and would have to navigate the complex regulatory hurdles of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nSince 2022, interest rates on credit cards has skyroketed, hitting a record high in August 2024. There are a number of reasons why; the Federal Reserve’s campaign to hike interest rates to combat inflation after the pandemic increased the Federal Funds Rate, which is tied to most credit cards’ rates. But Trump and other critics more have blamed credit card companies’ own greed as they extracted more money on top of the rate set by the Federal Funds.\n\nIn 2024, the gap between the typical credit card interest rates and the rates that companies were issuing had the widest gap in history. That allowed large credit card issuers to generate returns on assets six times higher or more than their other banking activities.\n\nMeanwhile, evidence is piling up American consumers are under growing financial strain. Last April, a record number of Americans, 11%, met only the minimum requirement payment on their credit card bill. Consumer debt broadly surged in 2025, with the first three months of the year marking the highest level of debt delinquency since the pandemic.\n\nThis has put Trump in company with more Mamdani-like figures, namely Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But the cap is popular among politicians across the aisle. Senators Sanders and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill last year that would cap credit card interest rates at 10% for five years. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Trump had called her about the proposal this week. \n\nBut it is a nightmare for banks, which have been hammering away on the media cycle arguing the cap would actually cause stricter credit, meaning less people will get access to credit cards.\n\n“An artificial cap on credit card interest rates is likely to backfire on the White House by making credit less accessible to the cash-strapped households that most need it,” Columbia Business School economics professor Brett House told Fortune.\n\nTrump, however, has shown little hesitation in embracing populist policies that unsettle the business community. His second term has been marked by unusually direct executive intervention in markets, often to the discomfort of corporate America.\n\nJoining Scaramucci was veteran Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, former campaign advisor to Mitt Romney, who argued the proposal is a symptom of a larger identity crisis within the GOP. Stevens asserted there is essentially “no conservative party in America today,” noting the party has traded ideological philosophy for a series of “marketing slogans.”\n\nTo Stevens, it was “darkly hysterical” the Republican Party opposes Mamdani’s ascension so much while Trump’s own policies look more classically socialist, first in taking a direct stake in semiconductor champion Intel and now in proposing a cap on interest rates.\n\n“Your socialism is not as good as our socialism,” Stevens said, highlighting what he views as a hypocritical shift toward big-government interventionism.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.",
    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.\n\nTrump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.”\n\nDuring an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\n\n“I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said.\n\nHe had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.\n\nEarlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThat encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.\n\nEuropean leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.\n\nA relationship that ‘we need to nurture’\n\nIn Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\n\nDelegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group’s hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that’s what you’re hearing with this delegation.”\n\nThe tone contrasted with that emanating from the White House. Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The White House hasn’t ruled out taking the territory by force.\n\n“We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday’s meetings. “And mostly, I would say the threats that we’re seeing right now is from the U.S. side.”\n\nMurkowski emphasized the role of Congress in spending and in conveying messages from constituents.\n\n“I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said.\n\nAlong with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally’s consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council.\n\nInuit council criticizes White House statements\n\nThe dispute is looming large in the lives of Greenlanders. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.””\n\nThe chair of the Nuuk, Greenland-based Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents around 180,000 Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia’s Chukotka region on international issues, said persistent statements from the White House that the U.S. must own Greenland offer “a clear picture of how the US administration views the people of Greenland, how the U.S. administration views Indigenous peoples, and peoples that are few in numbers.”\n\nSara Olsvig told The Associated Press in Nuuk that the issue is “how one of the biggest powers in the world views other peoples that are less powerful than them. And that really is concerning.”\n\nIndigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.\n\nSuperville reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press journalist Serra Yedikardes contributed to this story from Kapikoy Border Crossing, Turkey.",
