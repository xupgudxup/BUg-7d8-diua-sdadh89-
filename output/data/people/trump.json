    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "description": "Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has insisted he’s a “kind” and “gentle” person while in the same breath blasting one of his very own appointees as a “moron.”\n\nThe president’s comments came as part of a confused and rambling Truth Social tirade posted early Thursday morning. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell again refused to cut interest rates, even though he has absolutely no reason to keep them so high,” Trump began.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly lambasted Powell, who he appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018, for refusing to follow White House instructions on interest rates. Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "The secretary acknowledged that the president misspoke, despite claims from White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
    "fullText": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that President Donald Trump had previously misspoken while defending his campaign to acquire Greenland — and critics are pouncing.\n\nWhile testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday, Rubio answered questions for the first time since a U.S. military operation in Venezuela led to the capturing of leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife. He said that the former regime represented an “untenable situation,” telling lawmakers that the United States does not intend nor expect to take any further military action “at this time.”\n\nAt one point, Rubio was asked a question by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) about the president’s desire to acquire Greenland, which was renewed in the days following the raid. Kaine pointed to an instance last week when Trump said Iceland instead of Greenland four times while addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\n“Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy, right? Last time,” Trump said, referencing a previous nickname from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\n\nAbout a minute later, Trump claimed that “they are not there for us on Iceland, that I can tell you.”\n\n“I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland,” Trump said. “So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”\n\nDuring the hearing, Kaine asked Rubio directly: “The president repeatedly mistook Iceland for Greenland, right? We’re not mad at Iceland... the president just mistook the two countries for each other, correct?”\n\n“Yeah, he meant to say Greenland, but I think we’re all familiar with presidents that have verbal stumbles,” Rubio said, appearing to take a jab at former President Joe Biden. “We’ve had presidents like that before. Some made a lot more than this one.”\n\nAfter some reporters and critics noted the president’s mistake, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt quickly hopped on the defense, responding to NewsNation’s Libbey Dean, who posted on X that Trump “appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”\n\n“No he didn’t, [Libbey],” Leavitt replied. “His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here.”\n\nLeavitt’s post has since been marked with a community note, with X users claiming that she is “not telling the truth.”\n\nA number of Trump’s critics quickly pummeled Leavitt following the exchange with Rubio.\n\n“Rubio calls Karoline Leavitt a liar,” the progressive network MeidasTouch wrote in response, though Rubio did not use the label directly.\n\n“So the Press Secretary wasn’t on the level here?” another user asked. “Shocking.”\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Fred Wellman added: “Swing and a miss, Marco! Better luck next time.”\n\nTrump told reporters last week that he would announce details of a compromise in “two weeks” related to the future of Greenland, which falls under the boundaries of Denmark, a NATO ally. His deadline came one day after he announced a “framework of a deal” with the NATO alliance, without providing any details.\n\nTrump called a potential proposal “infinite,” adding that it will be “a deal that’s forever.”\n\nRubio said during Wednesday’s hearing that “we’re in a good place right now” with Greenland. He noted that there is a “professional” process underway that will result in a “good outcome for everybody.”\n\nTrump has faced fierce resistance from officials in both Greenland and Denmark, who have argued that the semi-autonomous Arctic territory is not for sale. The president, however, has frequently maintained that ownership over the island, home to critical rare earth minerals, is necessary for national security, while warning against Russia or China occupying it in the future.\n\nIn his announcement of a “framework,” Trump also pointed to his proposed “Golden Dome,” a missile defense system that he has previously teased will be operating before the end of his term in 2029.\n\n“Because of The Golden Dome, and Modern Day Weapons Systems, both Offensive and Defensive, the need to ACQUIRE is especially important,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's $1,000 to \"Trump Accounts\" for employees' kids.\n\nThe banks each employ more than 160,000 employees in the US.\n\n\"Trump accounts\" are Treasury-funded accounts that give $1,000 to newborn Americans.\n\nJPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.",

    "fullText": "A federal appeals court ruled late Wednesday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it ended legal protections that gave hundreds of thousands of people from Venezuela permission to live and work in the United States.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem exceeded her authority when she ended temporary protected status for Venezuelans.\n\nThe decision, however, will not have any immediate practical effect after the U.S. Supreme Court in October allowed Noem's decision to take effect pending a final decision by the justices.\n\nAn email late Wednesday night to the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 9th Circuit panel also upheld the lower court's finding that Noem exceeded her authority when she decided to end TPS early for hundreds of thousands of people from Haiti.\n\nA federal judge in Washington is expected to rule any day now on a request to pause the termination of TPS for Haiti while a separate lawsuit challenging it proceeds. The country’s TPS designation is scheduled to end on February 3.\n\nNinth Circuit Judges Kim Wardlaw, Salvador Mendoza, Jr. and Anthony Johnstone said in Wednesday's ruling that the TPS legislation passed by Congress did not give the secretary the power to vacate an existing TPS designation. All three judges were nominated by Democratic presidents.\n\n“The statute contains numerous procedural safeguards that ensure individuals with TPS enjoy predictability and stability during periods of extraordinary and temporary conditions in their home country,” Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel.\n\nWardlaw said Noem's “unlawful actions have had real and significant consequences” for Venezuelans and Haitians in the United States who rely on TPS.\n\n“The record is replete with examples of hard-working, contributing members of society — who are mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and partners of U.S. citizens, pay taxes, and have no criminal records — who have been deported or detained after losing their TPS,” she wrote.\n\nTemporary Protected Status, or TPS, authorized by Congress as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, allows the Homeland Security secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.\n\nDesignations are granted for terms of six, 12 or 18 months, and extensions can be granted so long as conditions remain dire. The status prevents holders from being deported and allows them to work, but it does not give them a path to citizenship.\n\nIn ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in both Haiti and Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the national interest to allow immigrants from the two countries to stay on for what is a temporary program.\n\nMillions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. The country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.\n\nHaiti was first designated for TPS in 2010 after a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake killed and wounded hundreds of thousands of people, and left more than 1 million homeless. Haitians face widespread hunger and gang violence.\n\nMendoza wrote separately that there was “ample evidence of racial and national origin animus” that reinforced the lower court's conclusion that Noem's decisions were “preordained and her reasoning pretextual.”\n\n“It is clear that the Secretary’s vacatur actions were not actually grounded in substantive policy considerations or genuine differences with respect to the prior administration’s TPS procedures, but were instead rooted in a stereotype-based diagnosis of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti as dangerous criminals or mentally unwell,” he wrote.\n\nAttorneys for the government have argued the secretary has clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program and those decisions are not subject to judicial review. They have also denied that her actions were motived by racial animus.",

    "fullText": "Under Donald Trump, the White House has filled its social media with memes, wishcasting, nostalgia and deepfakes. Here’s what you need to know to navigate the trolling\n\nIt started with an image of Trump as a king mocked up on a fake Time magazine cover. Since then it’s developed into a full-blown phenomenon, one academics are calling “slopaganda” – an unholy alliance of easily available AI tools and political messaging. “Shitposting”, the publishing of deliberately crude, offensive content online to provoke a reaction, has reached the level of “institutional shitposting”, according to Know Your Meme’s editor Don Caldwell. This is trolling as official government communication. And nobody is more skilled at it than the Trump administration – a government that has not only allowed the AI industry all the regulative freedom it desires, but has embraced the technology for its own in-house purposes. Here are 10 of the most significant fake images the White House has put out so far.\n\nThe first AI image posted by the White House X account sets the tone for Trump’s second presidency – marking a turning point in which the shitposting that had been associated with the far-right online culture that brought Trump to power moved from fringe message boards, such as 4chan and Reddit, to mainstream platforms.\n\nThe image was posted alongside an announcement of the repeal of New York City’s congestion pricing, and leant into fears that Trump would govern as a king. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, held up the image at a press conference when she announced that she would defy attempts to block the congestion charge: “New York hasn’t laboured under a king in over 250 years. We sure as hell are not going to start now.” The congestion charge remains in effect.\n\nIn another post on Truth Social in October, the president posted an AI video depicting himself as a president-king, crown on head, flying over “No Kings” protesters in a jet fighter and dumping faeces on them. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, defended the post, saying: “The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue that he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that. He is using satire to make a point.”\n\nOpenAI’s Studio Ghibli-inspired meme generator became a sensation in March 2025, with its uncanny ability to translate any image into the beloved anime studio’s house style (without Studio Ghibli’s permission or approval).\n\nThe White House applied it to a woman in tears as she was arrested by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents before being deported. The original photograph, and the woman’s name and alleged crimes, are also included in the post.\n\nFor Caldwell, this demonstrated just how up to date the White House is with online trends. “They’re hopping on brand-new, fresh memes,” he says. He suspects White House staffers might be regular visitors to Know Your Meme. “The Studio Ghibli meme trend kicked off on March 25 on X; we covered it the following day; and then the White House covered it the day after that.”\n\nThis image is proof of Trump’s willingness and ability to insert himself into any conversation, even ones that have nothing to do with him, and shows how effective that can be.\n\nPredictably, the image went viral, made global headlines and was met with outrage from Catholic groups and politicians. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,” wrote the New York State Catholic Conference. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.”\n\nAs so often happens with such shitposting, those who ​took offence were accused of lacking a sense of humour. “They can’t take a joke?” Trump said soon after at a press conference. “You don’t mean the Catholics, you mean the fake news media … the Catholics loved it.”\n\nTrump has been the subject of flattering fan art throughout his political career (remember the digital Trump trading cards?), but AI has made the job a whole lot easier. On 4 May, the White House crashed Star Wars fans’ special day with this image of the president as a jacked Jedi, lightsaber in hand, garlanded by flags and eagles. Who cares if his lightsaber is the wrong colour (the good guys’ are blue), or that the White House’s claim to be the Rebellion not the Empire rang laughably hollow? This was pure fantasy art.\n\nIn 2022, one of Trump’s trading cards clumsily grafted his headshot on to a superhero body; last July he was slightly less clumsily grafted on to the body of Superman, to gatecrash the launch of the new movie. The same month, the White House portrayed a besuited Trump heroically striding into the Colosseum. Fans and allies have generated reams of similar content themselves.\n\nWhy did the White House choose to put the Democratic house leader Hakeem Jeffries and the senate leader Chuck Schumer in sombreros and have them holding plates of tacos? It doesn’t matter. They look a bit silly, and it’s provocatively offensive, and once again, the world’s attention is colonised.\n\nThe image illustrates how difficult it is to respond to this type of content. It’s part of a running joke, stretching back to a deepfake video Trump posted a month earlier, which slapped a crude sombrero and moustache filter over Jeffries. That video was roundly condemned as offensive and racist , not least by Jeffries himself (who replied by posting a genuine image of Trump with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein) . The Trump administration then doubled down, playing the video on a loop on screens in the White House briefing room for several hours and creating more images in a similar vein, which kept the trolling going.\n\nFew people outside the Trump administration believe the US is in a “golden age”, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim. In January, the White House posted an AI video of a golden White House facade behind a shower of gold coins with the text “The White House? She’s in her Golden Age”, backed by Bruno Mars’ track 24K Magic.\n\nEven if Trump’s Midas touch is more a figment of his imagination, this type of wishcasting is more effective than it appears. According to one paper by the academics Michał Klincewicz, Mark Alfano and Amir Ebrahimi Fard – who coined the term “slopaganda” – “neural representations of information that were shown to be false continue to influence people’s beliefs and reasoning after being corrected”. In other words, even when you know it’s fake, your brain still kind of believes it.\n\nOn the face of it, this seems like a straightforward “Trump wants Greenland” post. However, it has a much darker message.\n\nAgain, the post is riffing on a popular meme, Caldwell explains: the “dramatic crossroads” image originated with the manga series Yu-Gi-Oh!, and started gaining traction online around 2021.\n\nThe slogan “Which way, Greenland man?” seems to reference a 1978 neo-Nazi text titled Which Way, Western Man?, in which the white supremacist author William Gayley Simpson called for violence against and the deportation of Jews and Black people, and argued that Hitler was right.\n\n“It’s absolutely shocking to see such images being deployed by this administration,” said Heidi Beirich, a co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, which monitors US neo-Nazi groups. “The idea appeals to racists and white supremacists who think only white people should be in positions of power.”\n\nIn August, the Department of Homeland Security posted a mock recruitment advert for ICE with an image of Uncle Sam at a crossroads and the slogan: “Which way, American man?” Earlier this month, the US Labor Department posted an image with the slogan: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage”. Critics pointed out that it had overtones of Hitler’s “Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer” (“One people, one realm, one leader”).\n\n“AI is very good at constantly reiterating images from the past, so it can create this nostalgic imagery of traditionalism,” says Daniel de Zeeuw, an assistant professor in digital media culture at the University of Amsterdam. Thus the extremist messages of the present – such as ICE’s militarised policing – can be inserted into more reassuring and familiar graphic styles, such as patriotic recruitment posters, 80s action-movie posters or 1950s public information campaigns (as with a recent image of Trump as a friendly milkman).\n\nAI is inherently backward-looking, says de Zeeuw, as it is fed on historical images. This aesthetic is in keeping with the Make America Great Again movement, which is constantly evoking a “better” past. Another stark example was the Department of Homeland Security’s chilling post from last December: an image of a vintage car at a deserted, palm-fringed beach with the slogan “America After 100 Million Deportations”. Ironically, the original was painted by a Japanese artist, Hiroshi Nagai, who complained that it had been used without his permission.\n\n“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” said the agent filming the Minneapolis civil rights lawyer Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, as she was arrested last Thursday. Within hours, though, it was: the Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem posted a still from the video, in which Armstrong seems composed and shows little emotion.\n\nHalf an hour later, the White House X account posted a significantly altered version of the same image: this time, Armstrong is exaggeratedly upset, tears streaming down her face. Her skin tone also appears to have been darkened. The image was captioned: “Arrested: far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.” In fact, Armstrong was demonstrating at a church service led by an allegedly ICE-affiliated pastor, and was later released without charge.\n\nUntil this moment, the White House’s AI-generated output had been conspicuously outlandish: there was little danger of mistaking it for reality. This image purports to be an authentic photograph – or at least omits to mention that it is not. It is not so much AI-generated trolling as an AI-assisted deepfake.\n\nAs with Musk’s recently shared Grok tool, which removed women and children’s clothing without their consent, there is also something abusive about it: AI has been used to attempt to humiliate a woman by manipulating her image, to make her look weaker and more distressed than she actually was.\n\nThe fact that the deepfakery is not all that convincing is part of the point, de Zeeuw thinks. “What is being communicated here is the falsification itself: you’re showing your ability to falsify images, to falsify evidence.”\n\nAfter the fakery had been called out, the White House deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr posted the response: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”\n\nIn response to this image of Trump and a penguin walking towards a Greenland flag, some observers pointed out that penguins actually live at the south pole. But that’s missing the point of these types of post, says Robert Topinka, a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London. “People continue to interpret them as if they’re meant to be a legitimate claim, or an argument or a piece of evidence, but they’re emotional hooks.” Their purpose is to stir up the base. “White House staffers have said they use AI because it’s the fastest way to get content out. It’s not the fastest way to say something that’s true; it’s the fastest way to push their propaganda.”\n\nTo those in the know, this is a riff on the “nihilist penguin” meme, which has gone viral on TikTok in the past few weeks. It’s based on a scene from Werner Herzog’s 2007 documentary Encounters at the End of the World, in which one penguin inexplicably separates from the colony and wanders off towards the Antarctic interior, and certain death. “But why?” Herzog wonders. Many have asked the same of Trump’s quixotic attempts to acquire Greenland.\n\nThe image resonates with what Naomi Klein and ​Astra Taylor ​christened “end times fascism”, says De Zeeuw, where tech industry leaders and their enablers are almost willing the end of the world as we know it, striding towards oblivion like Trump and his penguin companion. “It’s like they know they’re moving toward the end, but they do so joyfully.”",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar blamed President Donald Trump for threats to her safety on Wednesday, one day after she was accosted and squirted with liquid at an event in Minneapolis.\n\nThe man arrested for Tuesday's attack has posted online in support of the Republican president.\n\n“Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,” Omar said during a press conference. Asked if she was nervous about appearing in public, she said, “Fear and intimidation doesn't work on me.”\n\nThe attack came during a perilous political moment in Minneapolis, where two people have been fatally shot by federal agents during the White House's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nOmar, a refugee from Somalia, has long been a fixture of Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric. After she was elected seven years ago, Trump said she should “go back” to her country. He recently described her as “garbage” and said she should be investigated. During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, shortly before Omar was attacked, he said immigrants need to be proud of the United States — “not like Ilhan Omar.”\n\n“It’s hard not to see the link between what happened and the attacks Trump has made against Omar personally, not to mention his siege of her city,” said Jeremy Slevin, who worked for years as a spokesperson for Omar before becoming a senior advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. Trump baselessly accused Omar of staging the attack.\n\n“She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,” he told ABC News.\n\nThe attack on Omar was a reminder of the country's threatening political climate, which has led some lawmakers to limit public events or not seek reelection.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said that she knows how Omar was feeling because an armed man showed up at her Seattle home in 2022, threatening her and her husband.\n\n“It has to stop. I mean, we are just trying to do our jobs, and, it could be quieted and could be called out by Trump and leaders in elected office who refuse to go along with it, but they continue to do it, and this is the consequence,” Jayapal told the Associated Press.\n\nThe suspect has supported Trump\n\nThe man accused of squirting the substance on Omar has a criminal history and has made online posts supportive of the Republican president.\n\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was convicted of felony auto theft in 1989, has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence and has had numerous traffic citations, Minnesota court records show. There are also indications he has had significant financial problems, including two bankruptcy filings.\n\nPolice say Kazmierczak used a syringe to squirt liquid on Omar during Tuesday's event after she called for the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the firing or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Officers immediately tackled and arrested Kazmierczak.\n\nKazmierczak hadn’t been formally charged or scheduled for an initial court appearance as of Wednesday afternoon. Daniel Borgertpoepping, spokesman for Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, said they had still not received the results of the police investigation. A statement from the Minneapolis Police Department said the FBI was now leading the investigation.\n\nIt's unclear if Kazmierczak had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. The county's chief public defender, Michael Berger, said the case hasn't been assigned to his office.\n\nIn social media posts, Kazmierczak criticized former President Joe Biden and referred to Democrats as “angry and liars.” Trump “wants the US is stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. “Stop other countries from stealing from us.”\n\nIn another post, Kazmierczak asked, “When will descendants of slaves pay restitution to Union soldiers’ families for freeing them/dying for them, and not sending them back to Africa?”\n\nA target of Trump from the start\n\nOmar's safety has been an issue for years. After Trump's initial round of social media attacks during her first year in Congress, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked Capitol Police to conduct a security review. Omar said six officers provided around-the-clock protection for her and her family.\n\nIn 2021, Omar played an audio of a death threat she received by phone during a press conference. The caller used racist and anti-Muslim slurs during in the recording. The congresswoman at the time called on her Republican colleagues to stand up to “anti-Muslim hate” in their ranks.\n\nThe following year, a man was sentenced to three years’ probation by a federal judge on federal hate crime charges after sending an email to Omar threatening to kill her.\n\nTrump stepped up his criticism of Omar in recent months as he turned his focus on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent — nearly a third of the Somalis living in the U.S. And he has linked the Twin Cities immigration crackdown to a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which most of the defendants have roots in the East African country.\n\n“I wouldn’t be where I am at today, having to pay for security, having the government have to think about providing me security, if Donald Trump wasn’t in office and if he wasn’t so obsessed with me,” Omar said Wednesday.\n\nThe attack on Omar came days after a man was arrested in Utah for allegedly punching U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida, in the face at a private party during the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nChristian Joel Young, 28, said “we are going to deport you and your kind” before striking the congressman, according to a probable cause affidavit. He was charged Tuesday in state court with two counts of misdemeanor assault and felony burglary for entering the bar illegally.\n\nA judge ordered him held without bail. Young’s attorney declined to comment.\n\nThreats against members of Congress have increased in recent years, peaking in 2021 following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol before dipping slightly only to climb again, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Capitol Police.\n\n“Almost all of us receive very regular threats,” said Rep. Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat who chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Omar has led the caucus in recent weeks while Casar has been on paternity leave. The congressman described Omar as “tough as nails” and said Trump should curb his rhetoric about her.\n\n“The point of what these violent actors want is for us to shut up and we just can’t give in to that,” Casar said.\n\nBiesecker and Brown reported from Washington. Amiri reported from New York. Associated Press reporters Hannah Schoenbaum in Salt Lake City and R.J. Rico in Atlanta contributed.",

    "fullText": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a large majority of Americans who agree with one another on the same subject in 2026, but the Bill Belichick's Hall of Fame snub seems to be doing just that – and even the ever-divisive President of the United States is weighing in on the matter.\n\nDonald Trump took to Truth Social on Wednesday to share his thoughts on Belichick after he was snubbed from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Belichick, a 29-year NFL head-coaching veteran with six Super Bowl rings, was considered a first-ballot selection by most fans. Still, we learned on Tuesday that he did not receive enough votes to be inducted in his first year of eligibility.\n\nTrump is considered a rather controversial figure these days, but his opinion on the matter seemed to be right in line with most of the NFL fanbase as he blasted the decision on social media. He also took shots in the same post at what he describes as the 'sissy' kickoff rule, referring to the new Dynamic Kickoff Rule implemented by the league ahead of the 2024 season.\n\n𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: President Donald Trump went OFF on the NFL voters defending his close friend Bill Belichick should've been a first ballot Hall of Famer.\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the unwatchable 'Sissy' Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill to not… pic.twitter.com/qMwbJcJmCH\n\n— Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 28, 2026\n\n“It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable ‘Sissy’ Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame,” Trump wrote Wednesday. “Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!”\n\nIt is not Trump's first time criticizing moves regarding the NFL and its personnel, calling the new kickoff rule 'ridiculous' in 2025. Recently, Trump announced he wouldn't attend Super Bowl LX in San Francisco because it is \"too far away,\" while blasting the scheduled musical performances by Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.

    "description": "Trump's pick to replace Powell could add a layer of uncertainty to how traders have been navigating bets on Fed rate decisions.",
    "fullText": "Bettors on prediction markets love wagering on Fed decisions.\n\nIn a post on its blog, Polymarket said that Fed moves are a favorite bet for a certain kind of trader, and they've identified a framework for how they're navigating the market.\n\nPolymarket's internal data shows that the moment when the odds around a Fed decision \"crystallize\"—defined as the leading odds becoming dominant and ceasing to flip—actually sets in weeks before the meeting. This probably is not surprising, as futures markets tend to broadcast the Fed rate-cut odds for weeks or even months before the next meeting.\n\nStill, Polymarket's blog shows how certain kinds of bets known as \"bonds,\" which are high-probability bets that rarely flip, are approached by bettors.\n\n\"Across 22 Fed decisions from March 2023 to December 2025, I find that Polymarket odds crystallize with a median of ~26 days before the Fed meeting, which is early enough to create tradable entry points,\" the author of the post writes.\n\n\"Crystallization\" is defined by one outcome pulling ahead with at least 80% odds and remaining stable for several days in a row without any major swings.\n\nThe post also notes that, in most cases, odds of a rate decision settle early, as the central bank typically chooses between keeping rates unchanged or adjusting them by 25bp. However, recently, the US economy has faced a lot more uncertainty around the economy and the path of interest rates.\n\n\"Each new data release can completely reverse market expectations, preventing odds from stabilizing,\" the post said. \"Prospectively, traders can identify regime shifts by reading more on Fed communications signaling framework uncertainty or monitoring elevated VIX for a continuous period.\"\n\nThe analysis also highlights the key lead-lag relationship between institutional markets, which adjust to monetary speculation almost immediately, and prediction markets, which typically react roughly a day and a half later.\n\nPlatforms like Polymarket aren't uncovering new information. Rather they are mirroring moves already priced in by other markets, creating small windows where Polymarket odds have not caught up to the broader market.\n\n\"It is worth noting that traders should view this on a relative-value basis rather than solely believing one is correct while the other is wrong as odds could flip quickly with new emerging data.\"\n\nThe author noted, though, that there is a potential wildcard for traders to consider going forward. Trump is set to replace Powell as Fed chair this year, and when he does, the central bank's new leader could abandon the forward-guidance policy, a key component of Polymarket's trading strategy.\n\nLee acknowledged that such a scenario would mark the type of regime shift that would be a test of the framework he outlined for navigating Fed policy moves.",

    "description": "Former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki expressed defiance Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw Washington’s support for Iraq if he returns to power.  Al-Maliki, who was nominated last week by the country’s dominant political bloc to return to the premiership, said in a statement: “We reject the blatant American interference in Iraq’s internal affairs and consider it a violation of its sovereignty.\"  Trump in a social media post Tuesday wrote, “Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos,” adding, “Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq and, if we are not there to help, Iraq has ZERO chance of Success, Prosperity, or Freedom.",

    "fullText": "US President Donald Trump and former star quarterback Tom Brady have said it is \"ridiculous\" legendary former NFL coach Bill Belichick has reportedly been denied first-ballot induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nBelichick is widely considered the greatest coach in NFL history, having won six Super Bowl titles as head coach of the New England Patriots with Brady at quarterback, and two as defensive co-ordinator with the New York Giants,\n\nHe reportedly fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction in his first year of eligibility, leading to widespread criticism from prominent sporting figures as well as Trump.\n\nTrump posted on social media to say it was \"ridiculous and should be overturned\".\n\nThree-time NFL MVP Brady, who won a seventh Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2021 before retiring two years later, said he could not understand the decision.\n\n\"If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, which is completely ridiculous because people deserve it,\" Brady told Seattle Sports 710 AM.\n\n\"He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl - give me one season - I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.\"\n\nBelichick's failure to gain sufficient votes could be a result of two scandals, known as Spy-gate and Deflate-gate, that engulfed the Patriots franchise during his time at the helm, according to ESPN, external.\n\nHowever, Brady said he was \"not worried\" that Belichick would never be entered into the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe added: \"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen, and he's gonna have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything he did, the commitment he made to winning and the impact that he had on all our lives.\"",

    "description": "The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong’s arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis.\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,” he said. “By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,” or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they’re seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can’t tell if what they’re watching is fake, and questions whether they would know “what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.”\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "fullText": "The UK is the country with no bloc.\n\nAt Davos, Britain refused to join Trump's Board of Peace, citing commitment to international law and rejection of the \"pay-to-play\" model. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway made the same choice. The difference is that those countries have somewhere else to go. Britain doesn't.\n\nThe SAFE instrument, the EU's €150 billion fund for joint defense procurement, is designed explicitly for strategic autonomy. Strict \"Buy European\" provisions limit non-EU subcontractors to 15-35% of contract value, phased out within two years. Canada, remarkably, negotiated access and now has preferential treatment on par with EU firms. The UK remains excluded.\n\nTalks broke down in late 2025. The EU's requirements for third-country participation, London viewed as an infringement on sovereignty. The same sovereignty concerns that drove Brexit now lock Britain out of the emerging European defense architecture. The \"mid-Atlantic bridge\" was always a metaphor. Britain positioned itself as the hinge between American power and European integration, useful to both, dependent on neither. That positioning assumed both poles wanted a bridge. Now the US treats allies as protection rackets and the EU is building walls around its defense industrial base. The bridge has nowhere to land.\n\nWhat does the Starmer government do? The choices were supposed to be theoretical. Align with Washington and accept the transactional terms of the Donroe Doctrine. Align with Brussels and accept the sovereignty constraints of SAFE participation. Or go it alone, with a defense budget that can't sustain independent capability against peer competitors.\n\nThe IISS analysis of SAFE's implications for non-EU suppliers is blunt: firms outside the bloc face structural disadvantages that compound over time. Procurement cycles last decades. If British defense firms are locked out of European contracts now, the gap widens with each passing year. The industrial base erodes.\n\n\"Global Britain\" was the slogan after Brexit, a vision of nimble bilateral relationships unconstrained by Brussels bureaucracy. The reality is that global influence requires either hard power or bloc membership. Britain has neither the military budget for the former nor the political will for the latter.\n\nCanada's pivot is instructive. Facing similar pressure from Washington, Carney diversified, joining SAFE, negotiating with Beijing, building horizontal coalitions with other middle powers. Britain has done none of this. It refused the Board of Peace on principle but hasn't found an alternative structure to join on pragmatism.\n\nPrinciples without alternatives is just isolation. The UK is learning what it means to be a middle power without a coalition, morally opposed to the new American order but structurally excluded from the European one.",

    "description": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's one-time contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts.\"",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell partnered with the Trump Accounts initiative and committed to contributing $250 to the accounts of 25 million American children, totaling a $6.25 billion donation from their charitable fund. Children aged 10 and younger who were born before January 1, 2025, and live in a ZIP code with a median income of $150,000 or less are eligible for the money. \n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, also announced plans to donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut living in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less.",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "description": "The Dispatch published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his \"enablers\" in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "The Dispatch, a conservative publication founded by former Fox News contributors Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes, published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his “enablers” in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the headline “The Cost of Silence,” The Dispatch‘s editors described a dismal state of affairs, pointing to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, the manufactured crisis over Greenland, Canada’s cozying up to China, continued economic uncertainty, and the criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as examples of the chaos invited by the Trump administration.\n\n“One of the ironies repeated throughout world political history is that autocrats rarely bring the order they are elected—or installed—to deliver, even the servile kind that can be imposed through state terror. No, more reliably, autocrats bring disorder,” they argued. “The disorder under which Americans are now suffering, the ramifications of which have only just begun to be realized, is what inevitably happens when an American president disregards the rule of law, insisting that he is limited only by his own sense of morality—a sense of morality that in this case does not quite seem to exist.”\n\nWe are aware that Dispatch readers have read and heard us repeat these points a thousand times in articles and on podcasts, and we are equally aware that a Dispatch editorial, while rare, is not going to be the “J’accuse!” that forces the powers that be to rethink where they are and what has brought them there. But we will repeat ourselves nonetheless: Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified for the office of the presidency, himself a man with no sense of integrity or administrative acumen, and one who is lazy, vain, ignorant, and vulnerable to flattery — all of which make him easy to manipulate for figures such as Stephen Miller, whose ethnonationalist obsessions and sophomoric Nietzschean posturing have dominated the administration’s agenda for months and who is emblematic of the types of advisers with whom the president has surrounded himself this second go-round.\n\n“But Trump is far from the only one at fault for the mess in which we find ourselves,” submitted The Dispatch, turning its attention briefly to former President Joe Biden, and then congressional Republicans.\n\n“When the history of our time is written, congressional leaders—particularly Republican congressional leaders—will be remembered as more important, and much more culpable, than it seems at this moment. Describing their careers as inaction would be too charitable; they have been enablers not only of the particular crimes of the Trump administration but of the more general aggrandizement of the presidency and the subordination of the entire legislative branch—the branch created by Article I of our Constitution to make laws and exercise oversight of federal agencies,” it argued. “They are, in a very real sense, in gross violation of their oaths of office, and so too are the representatives and senators of both parties who have contributed over the years to the reduction of Congress to its current miserable state.”\n\nAfter posing a hard-hitting question to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) — “If you cannot act in the face of this—all this — why do you choose to remain in the Senate at all?” — the editorial concluded thusly:\n\nDante put his cowards and opportunists — those who refused to take a stand in life — in the vestibule of his inferno: It isn’t Hell proper, but you can see the rest of the underworld from there. The cowards and opportunists in the United States in 2026 stand at a precipice, too, and have brought our country to the verge of something awful and unspeakable. We got here one step at a time — let us hope that we remember the way back.\n\nThe post The Dispatch Warns Trump and GOP Have ‘Brought Our Country to the Verge of Something Awful and Unspeakable’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Reid Hoffman says business leaders are wrong to stay silent and that they have a responsibility to speak up.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders who believe staying quiet about the Trump administration will protect their companies are making a dangerous miscalculation, says Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and tech investor said in an episode of the \"Rapid Response\" podcast published Tuesday that he rejects the idea that executives can simply wait out political turbulence.\n\n\"The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won't be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is a longtime Democratic donor and one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken political voices. He has backed Democratic candidates and causes for years and has publicly clashed with pro-Trump business leaders, including the White House AI czar, David Sacks.\n\nIn 2024, Hoffman contributed $2 million to a super PAC that spearheaded a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.\n\nHoffman said fear of retaliation from the Trump administration has made many business leaders hesitant to speak publicly, but fear is exactly the wrong guide. Executives should speak out instead of rationalizing that \"it's the right thing for my business,\" he added.\n\nHoffman framed public engagement as a responsibility that comes with wealth and power.\n\n\"Human beings first,\" he said. \"Humanity, society, right, you are members of both of those.\"\n\n\"Anyone who's wealthy in the society should be extremely grateful for being part of the society. You have responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nHoffman said he is \"regularly called out by the White House\" and added that it should not be punitive for leaders to speak based on their knowledge and experience.\n\n\"Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be speaking up, and we need to be figuring out how to solve our problems together,\" he added.\n\nHoffman's comments come as some business and tech leaders have broken their silence over the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the broader immigration crackdown under the Trump administration.\n\nPretti's death — the second killing by federal officers within weeks — has drawn sharp public debate over federal enforcement tactics and accountability.\n\nSome business and tech leaders reacted strongly. Google DeepMind's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote in response to a video of the shooting on X that \"this is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nOthers have joined in, including former Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. LeCun bluntly labelled the footage of the shooting \"Murderers.\"\n\nA group of more than 60 Minnesota-based CEOs signed a letter on Sunday urging \"de-escalation\" and collaboration among state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\nOther CEOs have remained quiet on the issue. Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote Tuesday that business leaders have several reasons for staying silent, including concern that the Trump administration has made it clear it is willing to pressure or punish companies that don't bend to its will.",

    "fullText": "Former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is sharing his concerns about the “media morons” he claims are distorting the truth about American safety.\n\nBongino, who stepped down from his position earlier this month after serving in his role for less than a year, went on a tangent about the media while being interviewed by Fox News on Thursday, accusing the media of having a double standard when it comes to reporting on public safety.\n\nThe topic came up while discussing a recent report from Axios, claiming that according to the Council on Criminal Justice, the U.S. murder rate has reached its lowest level since 1900.\n\nHowever, Fox News claimed that violent crime was already falling to a two-decade low during former President Joe Biden’s final year in office.\n\n“Well, there’s a thousand excuses as to why President Trump and his administration didn’t do it,” he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. “Meanwhile, I lived it. I know what we did and didn’t do for these (expletive).”\n\nBongino then cited a New York Times article, which included interviews with several current and former employees who accused Director of the FBI Kash Patel of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge. Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country,\" Bongino said.\n\nBongino said the media is a “big, full diaper,” adding that he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity then commented by saying that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” observing he was more restrained when he held a government title.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”\n\nSuffolk DA on Minneapolis: ICE’s, Border Patrol’s tactics ‘threaten citizens everywhere’\n\n‘Nasty profession’: Trump reveals why he skewers people in public he thinks are ‘nice’\n\nTrump calls vocal critic ‘incompetent’ as 2028 presidential race heats up\n\nMass.

    "description": "Brittney Griner considers the Trump administration's ongoing ICE-led deportations and arrests a \"crime against humanity.\"",
    "fullText": "WNBA star Brittney Griner considers the Trump administration’s ongoing, increasingly aggressive ICE-led deportations, arrests and overall immigration strategy a “crime against humanity.”\n\nThe WNBA champion and three-time Olympic gold medalist stars in director Alex Stapleton’s new documentary “The Brittney Griner Story.” The doc, which premieres Tuesday at Sundance, recounts Griner’s early 2022 arrest by Russian customs officials for accidentally bringing a cannabis vape cartridge into the country and the 10 months she spent detained in a Russian prison, as well as the global efforts that were undertaken to ensure her release.\n\nThe film’s festival debut comes just a little over three years after Griner was released in Dec. 2022 from a Russian penal colony in a prisoner exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. It is also premiering at a time when concerns about ICE’s detainment practices in America are at an all-time high.\n\nAs protests continue on the wintery, frozen streets of Minnesota, where two Minneapolis residents have already been shot and killed during tense encounters with ICE and Border Patrol agents, Griner was asked about the turmoil and shared her thoughts on the subject in a Sundance conversation with TheWrap’s executive editor Adam Chitwood.\n\n“At the end of the day, it just comes down to just being a good person,” Griner told TheWrap. “We are taking children. There’s facilities where it’s nothing but kids. You can hear them screaming and yelling when people go to try to get access to it, people that have never even been in these countries [they’re trying to send them to], and they’re getting deported into these horrible situations. It’s really sad.”\n\n“This is something that I didn’t think that I would ever see in my own country,” Griner added. “I traveled abroad. I’ve been to a lot of different places. I’ve been detained. I never thought that this would be my reality in my own country, where it should not be the case. And then to justify the things and lie. It’s sad.”\n\nIt is partly because of the current unrest in America that Stapleton, for her part, believes now is the right time for “The Brittney Griner Story” to be released to audiences. “I feel like it is God’s timing for this story, for her story, to come out,” Stapleton told TheWrap. “Because now more than ever, people need to understand the blurred lines between what an authoritarian regime will do.”\n\n“I think we need to understand how important it is to fight for our freedom,” Stapleton explained. “It’s important now more than ever, I think, for people to be in rooms like this, at festivals like this, to be in community, in real life, so that we understand that we are all humans, and that some of the evil that’s coming off of social media, it’s actually a very small group. I think that most of us believe in the power of good and the power of humanity, and so I hope that this film touches on some of those themes and gets people talking.”\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 25 years,” Stapleton added, reflecting on the timing of this year’s Sundance Film Festival and the situation she and other filmmakers have found themselves in. “I think we feel guilty that we’re not out on the streets protesting, and we’ve all had to tell ourselves that our work is our protest.”\n\nThe post Brittney Griner Calls ICE Minnesota Killing, Deportations ‘Crimes Against Humanity’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "From phone spyware and facial recognition to phone unlocking technology and databases and more, this tech powers Trump's deportation machine.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he would make countering immigration one of his flagship policies during his second term in the White House, promising an unprecedented number of deportations.\n\nA year in, data shows that deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection have surpassed at least 350,000 people.\n\nICE has taken center stage in Trump’s mass removal campaign, raiding homes, workplaces, and public parks in search of undocumented people, prompting widespread protests and resistance from communities across the United States.\n\nICE uses several technologies to identify and surveil individuals. Homeland Security has also leveraged the shadow of Trump’s deportations to challenge long-standing legal norms, including forcibly entering homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant, a move that legal experts say violates the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nHere are some of the technologies that ICE is relying on.\n\nICE has a technology known as cell-site simulators to snoop on cellphones. These surveillance devices, as the name suggests, are designed to appear as a cellphone tower, tricking nearby phones into connecting to them. Once that happens, the law enforcement authorities who are using the cell-site simulators can locate and identify the phones in their vicinity, and potentially intercept calls, text messages, and internet traffic.\n\nCell-site simulators are also known as “stingrays,” based on the brand name of one of the earliest versions of the technology, which was made by U.S. defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris); or IMSI catchers, a technology that can capture a nearby cell phone’s unique identifier, which law enforcement can use for identifying the phone’s owner.\n\nIn the last two years, ICE has signed contracts for more than $1.5 million with a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), which produces customized vans for law enforcement.\n\nA contract worth more than $800,000, dated May 8, 2025, said TOSV will provide “Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program.”\n\nTOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch that the company does not manufacture the cell-site simulators, but rather integrates them “into our overall design of the vehicle.”\n\nCell-site simulators have long been controversial for several reasons.\n\nThese devices are designed to trick all nearby phones to connect to them, which means that, by design, they gather the data of many innocent people. Also, authorities have sometimes deployed them without first obtaining a warrant.\n\nAuthorities have also tried to keep their use of the technology secret in court, withholding information and even accepting plea deals and dropping cases rather than disclose information about their use of cell-site simulators. In a court case in 2019 in Baltimore, it was revealed that prosecutors were instructed to drop cases rather than violate a non-disclosure agreement with the company that makes the devices.\n\nClearview AI is perhaps the most well-known facial-recognition company today. For years, the company promised to be able to identify any face by searching through a large database of photos it had scraped from the internet.\n\nOn Monday, 404 Media reported that ICE has signed a contract with the company to support its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), “with capabilities of identifying victims and offenders in child sexual exploitation cases and assaults against law enforcement officers.”\n\nAccording to a government procurement database, the contract signed last week is worth $3.75 million.\n\nICE has had other contracts with Clearview AI in the last couple of years. In September 2024, the agency purchased “forensic software” from the company, a deal worth $1.1 million. The year before, ICE paid Clearview AI nearly $800,000 for “facial recognition enterprise licenses.”\n\nClearview AI did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE is also using a facial-recognition app called Mobile Fortify, which federal agents use to identify people on the street. The app relies on scanning a person’s driver’s license photo against 200 million photos, much of the data sourced from state driver’s license databases.\n\nIn September 2024, ICE signed a contract worth $2 million with Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions. Almost immediately, the Biden administration issued a “stop work order,” putting the contract under review to make sure it complied with an executive order on the government’s use of commercial spyware.\n\nBecause of that order, for nearly a year, the contract remained in limbo. Then, last week, the Trump administration lifted the stop-work order, effectively reactivating the contract.\n\nAt this point, the status of Paragon’s relationship with ICE in practice is unclear.\n\nThe records entry from last week said that the contract with Paragon is for “a fully configured proprietary solution including license, hardware, warranty, maintenance, and training.” Practically speaking, unless the hardware installation and training were done last year, it may take some time for ICE to have Paragon’s system up and running.\n\nIt’s also unclear if the spyware will be used by ICE or HSI, an agency whose investigations are not limited to immigration, but also cover online child sexual exploitation, human trafficking, financial fraud, and more.\n\nParagon has long tried to portray itself as an “ethical” and responsible spyware maker, and now has to decide if it’s ethical to work with Trump’s ICE. A lot has happened to Paragon in the last year. In December, American private equity giant AE Industrial purchased Paragon, with a plan to merge it with cybersecurity company RedLattice, according to Israeli tech news site Calcalist.\n\nIn a sign that the merger may have taken place, when TechCrunch reached out to Paragon for comment on the reactivation of the ICE contract last week, we were referred to RedLattice’s new vice president of marketing and communications, Jennifer Iras.\n\nRedLattice’s Iras did not respond to a request for comment for this article, nor for last week’s article.\n\nIn the last few months, Paragon has been ensnared in a spyware scandal in Italy, where the government has been accused of spying on journalists and immigration activists. In response, Paragon cut ties with Italy’s intelligence agencies.\n\nIn mid-September, ICE’s law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, signed a contract with Magnet Forensics for $3 million.\n\nThis contract is specifically for software licenses so that HSI agents can “recover digital evidence, process multiple devices,” and “generate forensic reports,” according to the contract description.\n\nMagnet is the current maker of the phone hacking and unlocking devices known as Graykey. These devices essentially give law enforcement agents the ability to connect a locked phone to them, unlock it, and access the data inside of it.\n\nMagnet Forensics, which merged with Graykey maker Grayshift in 2023, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the end of September, 404 Media reported that ICE bought access to an “all-in-one” surveillance tool that allows the agency to search through databases of historical cellphone location data, as well as social media information.\n\nThe tool appears to be made of two products called Tangles and Webloc, which are made by a company called Penlink. One of the tools promises to leverage “a proprietary data platform to compile, process, and validate billions of daily location signals from hundreds of millions of mobile devices, providing both forensic and predictive analytics,” according to a redacted contract found by 404 Media.\n\nThe redacted contract does not identify which one of the tools makes that promise, but given its description, it’s likely Webloc. Forbes previously cited a case study that said Webloc can search a given location to “monitor trends of mobile devices that have given data at those locations and how often they have been there.”\n\nThis type of cellphone location data is harvested by companies around the world using software development kits (SDKs) embedded in regular smartphone apps, or with an online advertising process called real-time bidding (RTB), where companies bid in real-time to place an ad on the screen of a cellphone user based on their demographic or location data. The latter process has the by-product of giving ad tech companies that kind of personal data.\n\nOnce collected, this mass of location data is transferred to a data broker who then sells it to government agencies. Thanks to this layered process, authorities have used this type of data without getting a warrant by simply purchasing access to the data.\n\nThe other tool, Tangles, is an “AI-powered open-source intelligence” tool that automates “the search and analysis of data from the open, deep, and the dark web,” according to Penlink’s official site.\n\nForbes reported in September that ICE spent $5 million on Penlink’s two tools.\n\nPenlink did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nICE relies on automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies to follow drivers across a large swath of the U.S., noting where people go and when.\n\nICE also leans on its connections with local law enforcement agencies, which have contracts with ALPR providers, like surveillance company Flock Safety, to obtain immigration data by the back door. Flock is one of the largest ALPR providers, with over 40,000 license plate scanners around the United States, and only getting larger with its partnerships with other companies, such as video surveillance company Ring.\n\nEfforts by ICE to informally request data from local law enforcement have prompted some police departments to cut off federal agencies from their access.\n\nBorder Patrol runs its own surveillance network of ALPR cameras, the Associated Press reported.\n\nFor years, ICE has used the legal research and public records data broker LexisNexis to support its investigations.\n\nIn 2022, two non-profits obtained documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, which revealed that ICE performed more than 1.2 million searches over seven months using a tool called Accurint Virtual Crime Center. ICE used the tool to check the background information of migrants.\n\nA year later, The Intercept revealed that ICE was using LexisNexis to detect suspicious activity and investigate migrants before they even committed a crime, a program that a critic said enabled “mass surveillance.”\n\nAccording to public records, LexisNexis currently provides ICE “with a law enforcement investigative database subscription (LEIDS) which allows access to public records and commercial data to support criminal investigations.”\n\nThis year, ICE has paid $4.7 million to \n\nLexisNexis spokesperson Jennifer Richman told TechCrunch that ICE has used the company’s product “data and analytics solutions for decades, across several administrations.”\n\n“Our commitment is to support the responsible and ethical use of data, in full compliance with laws and regulations, and for the protection of all residents of the United States,” said Richman, who added that LexisNexis “partners with more than 7,500 federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial agencies across the United States to advance public safety and security.”\n\nData analytics and surveillance technology giant Palantir has signed several contracts with ICE in the last year. The biggest contract, worth $18.5 million from September 2024, is for a database system called “Investigative Case Management,” or ICM.\n\nThe contract for ICM goes back to 2022, when Palantir signed a $95.9 million deal with ICE. The Peter Thiel-founded company’s relationship with ICE dates back to the early 2010s.\n\nEarlier this year, 404 Media, which has reported extensively on the technology powering Trump’s deportation efforts, and particularly Palantir’s relationship with ICE, revealed details of how the ICM database works. The tech news site reported that it saw a recent version of the database, which allows ICE to filter people based on their immigration status, physical characteristics, criminal affiliation, location data, and more.\n\nAccording to 404 Media, “a source familiar with the database” said it is made up of ‘tables upon tables’ of data and that it can build reports that show, for example, people who are on a specific type of visa who came into the country at a specific port of entry, who came from a specific country, and who have a specific hair color (or any number of hundreds of data points).”\n\nThe tool, and Palantir’s relationship with ICE, was controversial enough that sources within the company leaked to 404 Media an internal wiki where Palantir justifies working with Trump’s ICE.\n\nPalantir is also developing a tool called “ImmigrationOS,” according to a contract worth $30 million revealed by Business Insider.\n\nImmigrationOS is said to be designed to streamline the “selection and apprehension operations of illegal aliens,” give “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations, and track people overstaying their visa, according to a document first reported on by Wired.\n\nFirst published on September 13, 2025, and updated on September 18, 2025, to include Magnet Forensics’ new contract, again on October 8, 2025, to include cell-site simulators and location data, and again on January 26, 2026, to include license plate readers.",

    "description": "Vindman, a retired lieutenant colonel now challenging Republican Ashley Moody, testified before Congress about Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI — Democrat Alexander Vindman, the former National Security Council aide who helped trigger President Donald Trump’s first impeachment, announced his Senate campaign in Florida on Tuesday to challenge GOP Sen. Ashley Moody.\n\nVindman’s entrance into the race pulls Trump’s agenda and record to the forefront of the Senate contest in Florida, bringing a national focus to a race in the president’s home state — one now widely seen as Republican-leaning. Democrats have a narrow path to wrest control of the Senate in November, in which they’d have to keep all the seats they currently hold and flip four others.\n\nVindman, born in Ukraine when it was still part of the Soviet Union, was an aide on the NSC during Trump’s first term. He testified before Congress about Trump’s 2019 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the president floated an investigation of then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump appeared to tie future U.S. aid to Ukraine’s willingness to launch and announce a probe that would be damaging to Biden.\n\nThe Senate acquitted Trump in that case, and Vindman, an Army combat veteran and lieutenant colonel, was fired from his position with the NSC. Vindman went on to become a vocal Trump critic, published two books and worked as a senior adviser for VoteVets, which helps to elect veterans to public office. He first floated a run for Senate in May 2025 on CBS Miami. He said at the time that he thought the 2026 midterms would be a referendum on Trump.\n\nVindman leans into his run-in with Trump in a campaign video launched Tuesday morning. “This president unleashed a reign of terror and retribution, not just against me and my family, but against all of us,” he said in the two-minute video. “Today, our country is in chaos.”\n\nThe Senate seat in Florida is up in a special election this year, and whoever wins will have to run again in 2028. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Moody, a former state attorney general, to the Senate when Marco Rubio became Trump’s secretary of State.\n\nMoody has to run for the seat for the first time in November, and appointed senators have a history of faring less well than those who were elected. But Moody already received Trump’s endorsement and is battle-tested statewide, having won her state attorney general races twice, both times by higher margins than DeSantis’ gubernatorial wins.\n\nAny statewide Democratic candidate faces an uphill climb in Florida, given that Republican voters in the state outnumber Democratic voters by around 1.4 million people. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report also classified the Senate seat in Florida as being in the “Solid R” category — the most GOP-friendly ranking available.\n\nMoody, who comes from a prominent legal family and isn’t facing a serious GOP challenger, has Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio on her campaign team. And former Trump campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita has a key role in a super PAC supporting her election.\n\nVindman’s campaign video draws attention to affordability issues that appeared to have had an impact in the better-than-expected showing Democrats had in 2025 races. He also brought attention to higher Obamacare premiums that kicked in this year. Moody — along with most Senate Republicans — didn’t support extending enhanced subsidies for premiums, a decision GOP pollsters previously warned would be unpopular.\n\nIn his campaign video, Vindman accused Moody of having been tapped to the Senate to “be a ‘yes’ vote for Trump and the billionaires.”\n\n“She’s not Florida’s senator,” says Vindman’s narration in the campaign video. “She’s theirs.”\n\nVindman, who lives in Democratic stronghold Broward County, enters an increasingly crowded Democratic primary that includes former Brevard County school board member Jennifer Jenkins; progressive state Rep. Angie Nixon; and Hector Mujica, a Venezuelan-American candidate who previously was head of philanthropy at Google for the Americas.\n\nPolitics are also in Vindman's family. His twin brother, Eugene Vindman, was elected to represent Virginia in Congress in 2024, in the seat formerly held by now-Gov. Abigail Spanberger.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong's arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,\" he said. \"By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,\" or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they're seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can't tell if what they're watching is fake, and questions whether they would know \"what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.\"\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "fullText": "Campaigners decry ties with ‘Trump-supporting’ tech firms after funding is accepted to develop state AI systems\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nMinisters have accepted $1m (£728,000) from Meta, the US tech and social media company, to build AI systems for defence, national security and transport, sparking warnings about the UK government’s “alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants”.\n\nThe money from Mark Zuckerberg’s company will be used to pay experts to “develop cutting-edge AI solutions … to support national security and defence teams”, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe money will pay for four British AI experts, coordinated by the government-funded Alan Turing Institute, to “play a pivotal role in rewiring our healthcare, police, transport systems and more”, said Ian Murray, the minister for data and digital government.\n\nThe move comes after Meta executives had 50 meetings with ministers in the last two years for which data was available, one of the highest levels of direct access of any technology company, a Guardian investigation found.\n\nThe government is consulting on a ban on social media use by under-16s, which would have a major effect on Meta’s Instagram platform. Meta said the money had been allocated to the Alan Turing Institute before any ban was floated.\n\nAnnouncing the $1m deal, Meta said it was “proud to help bring top British AI talent into government, fast-tracking the transformation of public services”.\n\nDSIT said: “People across the UK could benefit from faster, safer and more reliable public services as leading British AI specialists join government to modernise critical systems used every day – from public safety to transport maintenance.”\n\nBut the tech justice campaign group Foxglove asked: “What’s Meta getting for its million dollars?” It added: “When it comes to big tech, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.”\n\n“This is yet more evidence of the UK government’s alarmingly close relationship with Trump-supporting US tech giants,” said Donald Campbell, Foxglove’s advocacy director. “It’s deeply worrying that ministers are still naive enough to swallow this kind of lobbying from a handful of Silicon Valley plutocrats – who have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt they do not have the British public’s best interests at heart.”\n\nDaisy Greenwell, a co-founder of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, said the deal “highlights an uncomfortable reality: tech giants spend vast sums to gain access and influence in policymaking”.\n\nShe added: “That makes it even more important that decisions about children and online safety are shaped by independent evidence and the public interest, not by the companies whose products are under scrutiny.”\n\nThe government also announced a new partnership with the San Francisco AI company Anthropic, which will build and pilot a dedicated assistant tool for public services on gov.uk, starting with a model that will give jobseekers career advice “and help to lock down a job”. Anthropic said the project implementation work was “pro bono”.\n\nDSIT said the technology was “part of a cutting-edge plan to use AI agents for national government services, with a pilot expected to begin later this year”. In October, Anthropic announced that the former prime minister Rishi Sunak was taking an advisory role at the $350bn startup. The former Downing Street chief of staff Liam Booth-Smith is a policy and communications adviser to Anthropic.\n\nThe deals come as ministers wrestle with policy decisions that directly affect Meta and Anthropic. As well as launching a consultation last week on banning social media use for under-16s, they are also due to set out changes to how creatives’ copyrighted works are protected from being mined to build AI models, such as those made by Anthropic.\n\nBeeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer who campaigns on child protection and copyright, said: “This government is walking into dependence on Silicon Valley, is undermining the chance to build a UK AI sector, and above all is busy giving away some of the most precious datasets in the world to Silicon Valley, who could well afford to pay.”\n\nThe Meta-funded AI experts will be tasked with using AI to develop models that analyse images and videos, enabling councils to prioritise transport infrastructure repairs more effectively. They will also “develop cutting-edge AI solutions which run offline or within secured networks to support national security and defence teams to make vital decisions while safeguarding sensitive data”, the government said.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump had some harsh thoughts on a potential 2028 run for the White House from California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\n\nDuring an interview with the California Post, which launched on Monday, Trump blasted Newsom’s leadership in the Golden State as “incompetent” as he weighed in on the possibility that the governor could launch a bid in the next presidential election.\n\n“I’m amazed Gavin wants to run for office,” Trump said of one of his biggest critics during an interview in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nTrump argued that California needs “proper leadership,” claiming that Newsom hasn’t delivered since he began leading the state in 2019.\n\n“People love the dream of California, but they hate what’s happening to them,” Trump said, describing the Democratic governor as “incompetent.”\n\nNewsom has yet to formally announce a run for office, but has dominated as a top contender in several early polls, which have also floated former Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, among others.\n\nTrump has previously suggested Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a possible Republican ticket.\n\nIn the interview, Trump went on to predict that California’s high-speed rail project, expected to connect San Francisco and Los Angeles, will negatively impact Newsom’s chances on the campaign trail.\n\nFederal funding for the proposal came to a stop this month, while the project remained behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, according to KMPH-TV. It was estimated to cost up to $128 billion — almost four times the original $33 billion price tag — while a report from the U.S. Transportation Department said it was unlikely to reach a complete target for its initial segment by 2033.\n\nThe halt came as California dismissed its lawsuit in December that challenged the termination of $4 billion in Obama- and Biden-era federal grants, which the Trump administration has repeatedly tried to withdraw. Meanwhile, the House passed an appropriations bill last week that included a provision making the project ineligible for federal funding.\n\n“He has the train, the train to nowhere, that was supposed to be a simple train that went from San Francisco to Los Angeles,” Trump said, adding that “It’s the greatest cost runover that I’ve ever seen.”\n\nThe president noted that he could have built “that thing in one year.”\n\nTrump also said his relationship with Newsom has become “hopeless” from once friendly during his first term.\n\n“They’ve gone radical left,” Trump said. “They’re crazy.”\n\nTrump made a similar claim while he addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Newsom was in attendance, last week.\n\n“We’re going to help the people in California,” Trump said. “We want to have no crime.”\n\n“I know Gavin was here. I used to get along so great with Gavin when I was president. Gavin’s a good guy,” he continued, saying that he would help Newsom “in a heartbeat.”\n\nTrump confirmed to the Post that they both privately spoke, but declined to give details of the conversation.\n\n“I spoke to him fine,” he said.",

    "title": "13 times Melania Trump broke with White House tradition and defied expectations as first lady",
    "description": "Melania Trump has made the first lady role her own by straying from presidential protocol and long-held White House traditions.",
    "fullText": "First ladies often act as representatives of their husbands' campaigns, traveling the country to deliver speeches and meet voters at events. During all of Trump's presidential campaigns, Melania was noticeably absent, making only occasional appearances.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2023 that while Melania Trump privately supported Donald Trump's 2024 campaign, she rejected his offers to campaign with him.\n\nWhen asked about Melania Trump's absence, Donald Trump told \"Meet the Press\" in 2023 that he likes to keep her away from the campaign trail because \"it's so nasty and so mean.\"\n\n\"She's a private person, a great person, a very confident person, and she loves our country very much,\" he said of his wife.\n\nWhile Donald Trump moved into the White House after the inauguration, he told reporters that Melania Trump stayed behind in New York with their then-10-year-old son, Barron Trump, so that he could finish out the school year.\n\nWashington Post reporter Mary Jordan wrote in her book, \"The Art of Her Deal: The Untold Story of Melania Trump,\" that Melania Trump also used the time to renegotiate her prenuptial agreement.\n\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal broke the news that one of Donald Trump's lawyers, Michael Cohen, transferred a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election to keep her from speaking about their alleged 2006 affair.\n\nAfter reports emerged of Donald Trump's alleged affair, which he denied, Melania Trump backed out of a trip to Switzerland and other public engagements. She also arrived at the 2018 State of the Union address in a separate motorcade in a break from the tradition of presidents and their spouses arriving together.\n\nMelania Trump's then-director of communications, Stephanie Grisham, said that the first lady did not travel with her husband because she was accompanying the guests of honor, the BBC reported.\n\nDonald Trump was later found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up the payment to Daniels. After the hush-money trial reached its verdict in May, Donald Trump continued to deny the affair and called the trial a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nAfter The New Yorker published a report detailing a former Playmate's alleged affair with Donald Trump, which he denied took place, Melania Trump once again did not appear publicly by her husband's side.\n\nInstead of taking the traditional walk with Donald Trump across the White House lawn, she arrived at the presidential helicopter in a separate vehicle.\n\n\"With her schedule, it was easier to meet him on the plane,\" Grisham told CNN of Melania Trump's separate route.\n\nFor her first Christmas in the White House in 2017, Melania Trump lined the East Colonnade with bare white branches that cast shadows on the hall. In 2018, she filled the East Colonnade with dark-red trees that garnered comparisons to costumes in the dystopian TV series \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" The following year, clear acrylic panels lined the hall, and her final White House Christmas featured potted plants.\n\nHer avant-garde Christmas decorations garnered some criticism, while others praised her unconventional choices.\n\n\"Everyone has a different taste,\" Melania Trump said of the critical responses to her Christmas decorations at a town hall event hosted by Liberty University in 2018.\n\nIn a speech at the First Baptist Church in Dallas in 2021, Donald Trump said that Melania Trump \"didn't get exactly a fair shake\" when it came to her Christmas decor choices.\n\n\"She would make the most beautiful Christmas decorations,\" he said. \"And I remember she made these magnificent red trees, and the media said, 'Oh, that's terrible.'\"\n\nThroughout US history, first ladies have chosen outfits with deeper meanings that reflect their values. Laura Bush wore red to help bring awareness to the dangers of heart disease. Michelle Obama chose to highlight up-and-coming designers from underrepresented backgrounds. Jill Biden appeared at campaign events wearing boots emblazoned with the word \"vote.\"\n\nMelania Trump's \"I really don't care, do u?\" jacket, worn while traveling to visit immigrant children at the US-Mexico border in 2018, seemed an unusually combative wardrobe choice for a first lady.\n\nMelania Trump wrote in her 2024 memoir that her press secretary wouldn't let her clarify that the jacket's message was directed at the media.\n\n\"The media claimed the jacket meant I did not care about the children or the border, which was clearly not true,\" she wrote.\n\nMelania Trump delivered speeches at the 2016 and 2020 conventions. In 2024, she only attended the final day of the Republican National Convention and did not speak.\n\nDonald Trump accepted Joe Biden's invitation to meet at the White House as part of Joe Biden's pledge to ensure a peaceful transfer of power. However, Melania Trump, who released her memoir, \"Melania,\" in October 2024, turned down the first lady's offer to meet for tea, citing a scheduling conflict with her book tour.\n\n\"Mrs. Trump will not be attending today's meeting at the White House,\" Melania Trump's office wrote in a statement on X.\n\n\"Her husband's return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success. In this instance, several unnamed sources in the media continue to provide false, misleading, and inaccurate information. Be discerning with your source of news.\"\n\nIn November 2024, CNN reported that Melania Trump was \"unlikely\" to move into the White House full time.\n\nA week before the inauguration in January 2025, when asked by Ainsley Earhardt of Fox News about her plans, Melania Trump said she would primarily live at the White House, but would also divide her time between Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"I will be in the White House,\" she said. \"And, you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\"\n\nShe added that her \"first priority\" was to be a mom, first lady, and wife and to \"serve the country.\"\n\nSince taking office, Melania Trump has made appearances at official events, but has largely kept a low profile.\n\nMelania Trump was more involved in the redecoration of the White House during Donald Trump's first term. Her projects then included adding a new Tennis Pavilion, reupholstering the Red Room, and revamping the Rose Garden.\n\nThis time around, Donald Trump has been redesigning the White House according to his tastes by mounting numerous gold furnishings in the Oval Office, adding portraits of himself to the Entrance Hall, and paving a stone terrace in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn October, he oversaw his largest renovation yet: the demolition of the East Wing, which had previously housed the Office of the First Lady, to make way for a new 90,000-square-foot state ballroom.\n\nFirst ladies have historically waited to release books, documentaries, and other media about their experiences in the role until after their time in the White House has concluded.\n\nIn recent years, Michelle Obama published her bestselling memoir \"Becoming\" in 2018, a year after President Barack Obama left office in 2017, followed by a Netflix documentary of the same name in 2020. Laura Bush published her memoir, \"Spoken from the Heart,\" in 2010, a year after President George W. Bush left office.\n\nMelania Trump released her White House memoir, \"Melania,\" in October 2024, weeks before the presidential election. Her documentary of the same name was filmed in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump's inauguration and premieres on January 30.\n\nThe first lady hosted an early private screening at the White House on Saturday attended by CEOs, including Tim Cook of Apple, Eric Yuan of Zoom, and Andy Jassy of Amazon. Amazon paid a reported $40 million to license the documentary.\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published in November 2024. It was most recently updated in January 2026.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio says a second killing by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month has put America on the verge of civil war.\n\n\"The United States is now a tinderbox,\" the billionaire investor wrote in an essay published Monday on X.\n\nHe said the federal government's clash with authorities in Minnesota and other states is \"bad and likely to get worse\" after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti on Saturday. Renee Good was killed in a confrontation with ICE agents on January 7.\n\nDalio — the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds — said that if President Donald Trump doesn't back down, it would \"risk pushing us over the brink into a more clear civil war.\"\n\nThe US leader could prevent further escalation by appealing for peace, showing the justice system will deal with the shootings fairly, and reining in his immigration enforcement, Dalio said.\n\nThe path Trump chooses \"will have huge implications for what comes next, including possibly lighting the tinderbox,\" he added.\n\nTrump has pivoted to a more conciliatory tone since the weekend. In a Monday post on Truth Social, the president said he had a \"very good call\" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and the pair were on a \"similar wavelength\" on how to proceed with immigration enforcement in his state.\n\n\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said.\n\nDalio is one of scores of business leaders to speak out about the situation in Minneapolis. Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian urged US leaders in a X post to \"lead right now — deescalate,\" while philanthropist Melinda French Gates wrote on the platform that there's \"nothing more American than exercising our rights and holding our government accountable.\"\n\nDalio, the author of \"Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order,\" said the conflicts raging in the US today echo the decline of past superpowers. He said it was \"like watching a movie that I have seen many times in history.\"\n\nHe drew a parallel to a passage from his book: \"When broad-based discontent bubbles up and those in power allow it to grow, it can boil over to the point that when they try to put a lid on it, it explodes.\"\n\nDalio said on X that \"people dying in the fighting\" and \"conflicts between the states and the central government over their relative powers\" are two classic markers of the move into the \"more violent civil war stage,\" which often heralds the collapse of the \"monetary, domestic political, and international geopolitical orders.\"\n\nThe Wall Street titan and economic-history guru has been ringing the alarm on the crumbling of the current world order for several years now. In 2021, he pegged the probability of a US civil war within the next 10 years at 30%.\n\nHe has also decried the national debt of over $38 trillion, comparing it to an \"aggressive cancer\" and \"being on a boat headed to rocks.\"\n\nDalio wrote on X that the US needs to exercise greater \"financial discipline\" to protect its central role in the current monetary order, and resume abiding by the rules to allow disagreements to be resolved peacefully and democracy to function.",

But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled ICU nurse Alex Pretti an active threat to the ICE agents who shot him, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves and announcing that Greg Bovino was leaving the city.\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota, meanwhile, ordered Todd Lyons, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt for Trump administration failures to hold hearings for detained immigrants.\n\nTrump disputes staff and says slain Alex Pretti was not an ‘assassin’\n\nTrump was asked if the killed Minneapolis protester was an “assassin” as a key aide has claimed and the president answered “no.”\n\nThe president added, however, that protesters “can’t have guns” as Pretti did and “it’s just a very unfortunate incident.” Trump has said he wants the death investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an “assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.” Vice President JD Vance shared the post on X as well.\n\nTrump says he’s going to be ‘watching over’ investigation into Pretti’s killing, which he calls ‘very sad’\n\nThe president was asked as he left the White House on Tuesday whether he thought Pretti’s killing was justified and he responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway.\n\n“I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself,” he said.\n\nHe was also asked about Pretti’s family and said in response, he said: “I love everybody. I love all of our people. I love his family. And it’s a very sad situation.”\n\nTrump says Noem isn’t going to resign\n\nAsked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: “No.”\n\nDemocrats in Congress have called for Noem’s exit after federal agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis protesting immigration enforcement actions.\n\nTrump sent his border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis and said on Tuesday that Homan was meeting with both the mayor and Minnesota governor.\n\nMinnesota resident says ‘world-changing events’ so close to home have been ‘overwhelming’\n\nChristina Leeson, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb Edina and was at Pretti’s vigil Tuesday morning, said Bovino’s leave is encouraging, though she’s hesitant to believe things are over since Tom Homan is coming in.\n\n“It’s just overwhelming, the amount of world-changing events that have happened within a 3-mile radius,” she said, referring to the death of Renee Good earlier in January, and George Floyd in 2020.\n\n“I feel like this is usually the time of year where I think we all kind of question why we live in Minnesota when it’s, you now, negative zero or below zero for weeks on end,” she said.\n\nLeeson said the way the community has come together in recent weeks has been a reminder of “the community, and how much we care for our neighbors and look out for each other, and are going to come out, and stand for what we believe is right no matter what.”\n\nWalz has made his priorities clear to Homan, governor’s office says\n\n“Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota’s priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,” the governor’s office announced.\n\n“The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday. The Governor tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,” the statement said.\n\nImmigration agents still active across the Twin Cities\n\nIf they’ve changed tactics with the shift in tone from the White House, it wasn’t immediately clear in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area.\n\nThe streets appeared largely quiet Tuesday morning in South Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been regular sights in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where two people were killed by federal agents.\n\nBut Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis and in the suburb of Little Canada.\n\nEvery living former Democratic president has now addressed Pretti’s killing\n\nFormer President Joe Biden said on social media on Tuesday that the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis “betrays our most basic values as Americans.”\n\nFormer President Barack Obama said Sunday that the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer should be a “wake-up call to every American” and warned that “our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s statement Sunday said that “over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decisions we make and the actions we take will shape our history for years to come.”\n\n“This is one of them,” Clinton said. “If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.”\n\nCivil rights leaders to meet with Minnesota attorney general\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson and League of United Latin American Citizens president Roman Palomares will hold community events in Minneapolis on Tuesday before meeting with Ellison.\n\nThe events include a visit to the site where Alex Pretti was shot and killed by federal immigration officers for a “moment of reflection,” according to a press release from LULAC, and a “Community Conversation” held at NAACP’s Minneapolis headquarters.\n\nTrump immigration crackdown contributes to drop in US population growth rate\n\nTrump’s crackdown on immigration contributed to a year-to-year drop in the nation’s growth rate as the U.S. population reached nearly 342 million people in 2025, according to population estimates released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe 0.5% growth rate was a sharp drop from 2024’s immigration-fueled rate of almost 1%, which grew the population to an estimated 340 million.\n\nBirths outnumbered deaths last year by 519,000 people last year and 1.3 million people immigrated, compared with 2.8 million immigrants in 2024.\n\nIn the past 125 years, the lowest growth rate was during the coronavirus pandemic, when the population grew by just 0.16% in 2021. Before that, the lowest rate was just under 0.5% in 1919 during the Spanish flu.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump policies are affecting U.S. population numbers\n\nMinnesota attorney general wants more than talk from Trump administration\n\nKeith Ellison said he hopes Trump’s “Operation Metro Surge” will end immediately. Asked on MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” Tuesday if Trump’s newly conciliatory posture has led to more federal cooperation with state and local officials in Minneapolis, Ellison said “not that I’ve seen so far.”\n\n“You should understand, Minnesota is abiding by the law as written. We, under the 10th Amendment, the federal government doesn’t have the authority to convert us into its deputies,” Ellison said. “And what the federal government has done is said, ‘well, if you don’t do it our way, we’re going to saturate your state with 4,000 ICE agents until you cry uncle and obey.’ And that’s unconstitutional and illegal.”\n\n“It’s a good thing” Trump talked with Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’ mayor, Ellison said. “But we need to see some results ... they’ve got to show, not just say.”\n\nBrandi Carlile donating to defense of Minnesota ICE detainees\n\nDescribing herself as “heartbroken and angry for Minnesota,” the singer-songwriter says her foundation will grant $25,000 to a Minnesota organization that provides legal defense to people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n“Over the past month, the community there has continued to set an incredible example for the rest of us, demonstrating the power of uniting to protect our neighbors and defend what is right,” she posted on Instagram Monday. “Now, more than ever, it is vital that we continue to hold each other and take action to stop the hate that is spreading through our country.”\n\nCarlile said the Looking Out Foundation is granting the money to help The Advocates for Human Rights provide free legal assistance to detainees.\n\nFetterman calls on Trump to fire Noem\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is calling on Trump to fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after federal agents fatally shot two protesters in Minneapolis.\n\n“Americans have died,” Fetterman said in a direct appeal to Trump. “She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy.”\n\nFetterman, a Democrat who has increasingly voted with Republicans, said Trump should “NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.”\n\nFetterman voted with Democrats in April 2024 to dismiss a trial against Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, after he was impeached by the Republican-led House.\n\nWhat to know about Gregory Bovino\n\nThe field commander of Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people.\n\nBovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration’s city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.\n\n“We’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino said in an interview.\n\n▶ Read more about Bovino’s career, methods and approach\n\nMelania Trump, on morning show, calls for unity\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump said in a Fox News interview Tuesday that Americans needed to come together as protests continue in Minneapolis.\n\n“I’m against the violence. So, if — please, if you protest, protest in peace. And we need to unify in these times,” she said.\n\nMelania Trump’s comments went beyond her husband’s in calling for calm, though he has softened his rhetoric in recent days while continuing to blame Democrats for the violence.\n\nShe also echoed the president’s previous statements that he had a “great call” Monday with Walz and Frey, adding they were working together to ensure protests were “without riots.”\n\nThe interview with Ainsley Earnhardt on “Fox & Friends” was pegged to the upcoming release of a new documentary about the first lady.\n\nThis item has been corrected. Melania Trump said “if you protest,” not “if we protest.”\n\nTrump says his calls with Minnesota Democratic leaders were ‘great’\n\nIn a display of reducing tensions, Trump said in a radio interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Jacob Frey on Monday, after federal immigration officers killed a protester for the second time in two weeks.\n\nThe Trump White House has tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests. But after videos suggest his administration wrongly labeled Alex Pretti an active threat to ICE agents, the administration is trying to recalibrate its crackdown, putting White House border czar Tom Homan in charge of its Minnesota immigration operations among other moves.\n\n“Actually, they were both great conversations,” the president said on the show “Sid & Friends In The Morning” on 77 WABC in New York City. “So let’s hope that turns out to be so.”\n\nICE chief must appear in court to explain why detainees have been denied due process\n\nThe chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants. He’s ordered Todd Lyons, Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz wrote in the order dated Monday.\n\nMessages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nICE agents will have a security role at Milan Cortina Olympics\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will have a security role during the upcoming Milan Cortina Winter Games, according to information shared with local media by sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome. The Associated Press independently confirmed the information with two sources at the embassy.\n\nThe sources who confirmed ICE participation on Tuesday said that federal ICE agents would support diplomatic security details and would not run any immigration enforcement operations.\n\nDuring previous Olympics, several federal agencies have supported security for U.S. diplomats, including the investigative component of ICE called Homeland Security Investigations, the sources said. They could not be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting most ice sports during the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games.\n\n▶ Read more about the ICE agents' planned role in Milan\n\n—- By Trisha Thomas and David Biller\n\nBovino is set to leave Minneapolis as Trump reshuffles the leadership of his immigration crackdown\n\nBorder Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration reshuffles leadership of its immigration enforcement operation and scales back the federal presence after a second fatal shooting by federal officers.\n\nTrump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House, after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterization that authorities had not substantiated.\n\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\n\nA person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump's ICE enforcement leadership reshuffle\n\nTrump administration’s trust and credibility tested in wake of Pretti’s death in Minneapolis\n\nTrust is one of a president’s most valuable currencies, especially in a time of crisis. During his second term, Trump has persistently undermined the trust and credibility of major universities, national law firms and media and taken punitive actions against them. His supporters largely either endorsed those actions or stayed mum.\n\nNow the credibility question is aimed at his administration. While the criticism is not directly aimed at the president by his supporters, it is a sign that trust is eroding over some of his most important policies.\n\nThe White House seemed to try to ease the conflict Monday. Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz spoke and both suggested their conversation was productive. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, who has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement surge nationwide, is expected to soon leave Minneapolis.\n\nStill, lawmakers from both parties — including many Republicans — called for independent investigations and, perhaps most importantly, trust after administration officials gave one account of the shooting in Minneapolis, while contemporaneous video provided a decidedly different one.\n\n▶ Read more about how Trump's credibility is increasingly being questioned\n\nTrump will visit Iowa in a bid to focus on affordability during fallout from Minneapolis shooting\n\nTrump is headed to Iowa on Tuesday as part of the White House’s midterm-year pivot toward affordability while his administration remains mired in the fallout in Minneapolis over a second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month. Even as some top administration officials moved quickly to malign Alex Pretti, the White House said Monday that Trump was waiting until an investigation into the shooting was complete.\n\nWhile in Iowa, the Republican president will make a stop at a local business and then deliver a speech on affordability, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The remarks will be at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines.\n\nThe trip will also highlight energy policy, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said last week. It’s part of the White House’s strategy to have Trump travel out of Washington once a week ahead of the midterm elections to focus on affordability issues facing everyday Americans — an effort that keeps getting diverted by crisis.\n\nMinnesota killing produces backlash against Trump administration from Second Amendment advocates\n\nProminent Republicans and gun rights advocates helped elicit a White House turnabout this week after bristling over the administration’s characterization of Alex Prettibas responsible for his own death because he lawfully possessed a weapon.\n\nThe death produced no clear shifts in U.S. gun politics or policies, even Trump shuffles the lieutenants in charge of his militarized immigration crackdown. But important voices in Trump’s coalition have called for a thorough investigation of Pretti’s death while also criticizing inconsistencies in some Republicans’ Second Amendment stances.\n\nIf the dynamic persists, it could give Republicans problems as Trump heads into a midterm election year with voters already growing skeptical of his overall immigration approach. The concern is acute enough that Trump’s top spokeswoman sought Monday to reassert his brand as a staunch gun rights supporter.\n\n“The president supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens, absolutely,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.\n\nLeavitt qualified that “when you are bearing arms and confronted by law enforcement, you are raising … the risk of force being used against you.”\n\n▶ Read more about the backlash among gun rights advocates",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "As marauding state agents fill US streets, a leading German soccer official says countries should consider what was once unthinkable: skipping the 2026 World Cup.\n\nThis week, a leading German soccer official, Oke Göttlich, said that the time has come to consider the unthinkable: a boycott of the World Cup to protest Donald J. Trump’s United States. The most watched sporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and Göttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti, that “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to state agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the people of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have been, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where the ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\n\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of the Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team whose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes beyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where this discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German national team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions. Göttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in various regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\n\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff titled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for countries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would threaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap 5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of the ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was sending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be toward fascist violence.\n\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that traveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their families would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is saying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the next level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has witnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During Trump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and presented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when paraded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an opportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend values,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone threatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from Donald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief] Bernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\n\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far better historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these games to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of course, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four gold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\n\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for the entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive debates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already imprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion. Organizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a vote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These decisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards, quislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to be played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans. Now they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\n\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at watching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have bravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni Infantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to the bone.",

    "title": "What to expect from January's Fed meeting as Powell faces looming DOJ probe",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve will likely hold rates steady at its January meeting, even as Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure from Trump amid the DOJ probe.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve will make its first rate decision of the year on Wednesday — and all eyes are on Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe central bank's leaders have a near-total chance of holding rates steady this week, according to market-based projections from CME FedWatch. After three cuts in 2025, the Fed has penciled in one rate cut for the new year. In the long run, these rate decisions will affect the job market, consumer prices, and corporate America.\n\nBut there's a shadow over January's Fed meeting: The Department of Justice recently launched a probe into Powell's handling of renovations to the central bank's buildings. The Trump administration alleges that the chair gave false testimony at a June Congressional appearance, though Powell said the move should \"be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\" on the Fed.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" he said in a video statement released January 11.\n\nFed decisions impact mortgage and credit card rates, auto loans, inflation, and labor market churn over time. A slow but not catastrophically weak job market, combined with higher-than-ideal but relatively tame inflation, will probably mean a pause in rate cuts for now.\n\n\"There's little chance the Fed will vote to cut rates this week, as the data in-hand doesn't justify it,\" said NerdWallet's senior economist Elizabeth Renter, adding, \"The Fed's monetary policy job is a balancing act and their decision to keep rates as-is indicates the risks to either side of their dual mandate are relatively equal.\"\n\nThe central bank's dual mandate — to keep prices stable and the job market strong — has been tricky to balance lately. The US added fewer jobs than expected in December, the unemployment rate is hovering above 4%, and the inflation rate remained at 2.7%. If Fed leaders opt to hold rates steady rather than cut, it will be good news for inflation, at the risk of slowing down an already-sluggish jobs landscape.\n\nFor consumers, a hold means that interest rates for homes, cars, and credit cards would largely remain unchanged. The Fed also hopes to push inflation closer to its 2% goal. For job seekers, however, still-high borrowing costs could push companies toward layoffs or hiring freezes.\n\nThe Fed has made more headlines than usual this month. Powell announced grand jury subpoenas from the Trump administration through a video message posted online. And Governor Lisa Cook's case has reached the Supreme Court, following accusations of mortgage fraud from Trump.\n\nThe Powell probe has raised alarm about Fed independence with politicians, economists, and business leaders. North Carolina Republican Thom Tillis and other congressional leaders said they will now oppose all nominees to the Fed chair role from the Trump administration.\n\nWith Powell's term up in May, Trump is set to choose a successor as soon as this week. Frontrunners include Trump's economic advisor Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and Chief Investment Officer of global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder.\n\nThe president has been vocal in his desire for lower interest rates and hopes the next Fed chair will consult with him more closely on policy decisions.\n\n\"The hope is that whoever takes Powell's role next will be similarly data driven and level headed,\" Renter said.",

    "description": "It's been all Trump, all the time in the market so far this year. That could be about to change.",
    "fullText": "No matter how you slice it, it's been TrumpWorld in the stock market so far in 2026.\n\nSeemingly every day, the president is doing something new to stir up volatility in various asset classes and stock-market sectors. We here at First Trade have been breathlessly covering every twist and turn, dissecting the winners and losers of Trump's ever-changing focus.\n\nThat's why the arrival of this week is good news for anyone looking for a fresh set of catalysts. While there's always a chance that Trump stirs up more price swings, investors will — at a minimum — have some additional macro and company-specific material to sink their teeth into.\n\nHere are the two main events to watch, and the market significance of each.\n\nThis gathering of central bank leaders will take on a slightly different tone than the last few. There's no \"will-they / won't-they\" drama around interest rates. Investors see a 97% probability of rates staying unchanged. Nothing to see here.\n\nWhat traders will be keyed in on, however, is anything Fed Chair Powell might say about his long-running conflict with the president. Powell has grown more aggressive in his pushback as his term nears an end, especially after the Fed was recently served with subpoenas,\n\nMarket significance: For their part, investors have fought back against incursions on Fed independence the only way they know how: by dumping US stocks and bonds (aka \"selling America.\") They know, after all, that even Trump is sensitive to movements in both. (TACO trade, anyone?)\n\nIf Powell remains defiant, that could keep the Sell America trade going. Specifically from a stock perspective, his resistance to cutting rates sooner than later could be a drag on equities. If he takes a more conciliatory approach, that could be seen as stabilizing for the market.\n\nThis week is a veritable who's who of tech earnings, with four of the Magnificent 7 reporting over the course of two days: Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla on Wednesday, and Apple on Thursday.\n\nMarket significance: For Meta and Microsoft, people will be closely watching for signs that massive AI investment is starting to pay off on the earnings front. Last quarter, investors rebelled against big spending plans for both companies, pushing both stocks sharply lower. The message was sent: they want results, and quickly. It'll be the same deal this quarter.\n\nApple, meanwhile, will live and die by iPhone sales, although it's also crossed into the AI realm by partnering with Google's Gemini to power its new Siri tool. Investors will be listening for an update on that partnership.\n\nTesla's part in the AI race is mainly focused on self-driving cars, and traders will be hungry for guidance. Those self-driving ambitions have kept the stock's valuation afloat, even amid a global EV-sales slowdown.",

    "fullText": "Bessent said the Treasury is canceling its contracts with consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.\n\nAn employee at the firm pleaded guilty to leaking Trump and Musk's tax returns.\n\nThe company's stock dropped more than 11% after the announcement.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Treasury Department cut contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, whose employee leaked President Donald Trump's tax returns years ago. By early afternoon, the move sent the consulting firm's stock down more than 11%.\n\nThe department has 31 different contracts with the firm, worth $4.8 million in yearly spending and $21 million in obligations, it said in a press release. The press release noted that Charles Edward Littlejohn, a former employee at the consulting firm, leaked the tax returns of thousands of taxpayers. The leak affected roughly 406,000 people, according to the IRS.\n\n\"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,\" Bessent said in the release.\n\nA company spokesperson said in a statement that it has \"consistently condemned in the strongest possible terms\" Littlejohn's actions, and has \"zero tolerance\" for breaking the law.\n\n\"When Littlejohn's criminal conduct occurred over 5 years ago, it was on government systems, not Booz Allen systems. Booz Allen stores no taxpayer data on its systems and has no ability to monitor activity on government networks,\" the statement said. It added that the company supported the government's investigation, and that they \"look forward to discussing this matter with Treasury.\"\n\nLittlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to one count of unauthorized disclosure of tax return information and was sentenced to five years in prison last year, according to the New York Times. He shared the returns of Trump and other wealthy Americans, including Elon Musk, with the outlet and ProPublica.",

Newsom’s accusation on Monday came as a number of users on TikTok reported abnormalities and accused the platform of censoring their posts.\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University’s School of Law, said a video he recorded about reports federal immigration officers could use sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant had been placed “under review”.\n\nCasey Fiesler, an expert in technology ethics and internet law at the University of Colorado told CNN it was “not surprising that there’s a significant lack of trust” in TikTok’s new ownership. She told the outlet that she had problems uploading videos that alluded to the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former President Joe Biden.\n\nByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.\n\nWith more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture while ByteDance will own 19.9%.\n\nEach of the joint venture’s three managing investors, cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, will hold a stake of 15%.\n\nThe US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares hit a new record on Tuesday as investors hoped for the best from a barrage of U.S. large-cap earnings, though uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump’s latest tariff moves on South Korea boosted gold and silver.\n\nAccusing South Korea’s legislature of \"not living up\" to its trade deal with Washington, Trump late on Monday said he would increase tariffs on imports from Asia’s fourth-largest economy into the U.S. to 25%.\n\nStocks appeared to take the news in stride, with Nasdaq futures up 0.5%, as investors geared up for a slew of earnings from the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Tesla starting on Wednesday.\n\nEven South Korea’s KOSPI quickly reversed earlier losses to surge by more than 2%, hitting a new peak. European stocks are braced for a higher open, with EURO STOXX 50 futures up 0.3%.\n\n\"Enthusiasm over the most eventful earnings week of the season has investors raising exposure to tech shares ahead of four of the Magnificent Seven reporting results,\" said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\nOn Trump’s higher tariffs on South Korea, Torres believed a visit from South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan to Washington as soon as this Friday could \"ease tensions and buy its government some additional time to improve relations.\"\n\nStill, the uncertainty lifted safe-haven gold by 1% to $5,065 an ounce, just shy of an all-time high of $5,110, while silver gained 4% to $108 an ounce, not far from a record of $117.70 that was set on Monday.\n\n\"The frenetic nature of uncertainty, coupled with a weaker dollar, have been the primary contributors to this latest leg higher (for gold),\" said Christopher Louney, a commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nLouney said history suggested the current gold rally could run into early September or mid-December this year, adding that prices could go as high as $7,100 per ounce at the end of the year based on its 2025 performance.\n\nIn Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9% to hit a new record high. The Nikkei gained 0.7%, even with the recent sharp rebound in the yen clouding the outlook for Japan’s vast export sector.\n\nChinese blue chips rose 0.2%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is coming under fire again in the first few weeks of 2026 as a growing range of factors - including Washington’s desire for a weaker currency and Trump’s erratic policymaking - prompts a rethink of investors’ optimistic assumptions for a period of greenback stability.\n\nIts latest slump to more than four-month lows was driven by sharp gains in the Japanese yen starting on Friday when chatter about rate checks by the New York Fed fuelled the risk of a joint U.S.-Japan intervention to halt the yen’s slide.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.2% to 154.55 yen on Tuesday, having lost a staggering 2.6% over the past two sessions, which was well below the 160 yen level that is viewed as a line in the sand for Japanese authorities.\n\nAgainst six major currencies, the greenback was flat at 97.12, near a 4-1/2 month low of 96.8.\n\nIn the Treasuries market, the benchmark 10-year yield edged up 2 basis points to 4.2292% after falling for four straight sessions away from a recent peak of 4.313%.\n\nWorries about another U.S. government shutdown are also brewing in the background, with Republicans and Democrats at odds over funding for Trump’s Department of Homeland Security after the fatal shooting of a second U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minnesota.\n\nOil prices fell on Tuesday as investors kept an eye on a resumption in supply from Kazakhstan. Brent crude futures dropped 0.7% to $65.13 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.6% to $60.25.",

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "fullText": "Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed a proposed fan boycott of World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad.\n\nBlatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability of the United States as a host country. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported Mark Pieth's comments in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund.\n\nPieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.\n\nIn his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, “If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”\n\nIn his X post, Blatter quoted Pietha and added, “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.”\n\nThe United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.\n\nThe international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis.\n\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.\n\nTwo weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.\n\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

    "fullText": "This live blog is refreshed periodically throughout the day with the latest updates from the market.To find the latest Stock Market Today threads, click here.\n\nHappy Monday. This is TheStreet’s Stock Market Today for Jan. 26, 2026. You can follow the latest updates on the market here in our daily live blog.\n\nThe Trump Administration has reportedly proposed keeping reimbursement rates for Medicare plans almost flat year-over-year, much to the detriment of already slammed health insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, CVS Health, and the like.\n\nThe proposal, first reported in WSJ this evening, says that payments will increase by an average rate of \"0.09%\" in 2027. The reaction after hours has been stark. On news of the report, the aforementioned three firms --- among the largest Medicare Advantage providers --- fell 8.8%, 12.8%, and 9.5% after the bell.\n\nAlthough over half of U.S. equities were in decline today, large caps kept the market on track. The Dow (+0.64%), S&P 500(+0.50%), and Nasdaq (+0.43%) continued a four day winning streak, while the Russell 2000 (-0.36%) suffered modest declines.\n\nTop of mind for most investors were forthcoming earnings and the Fed rate decision due out tomorrow. Earnings alone would have been a sufficient distraction this week, with reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, and others.

    "description": "A major shakeup is underway after Border Czar Tom Homan was ordered by Donald Trump to take over the ICE operation in Minnesota, sidelining Kristi Noem.",
    "fullText": "Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino - dubbed 'little Napoleon' - has been ordered to leave Minneapolis in a major shakeup initiated by Tom Homan.\n\nDonald Trump sidelined Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, dispatching Border Czar Homan, an ICE veteran, to take charge of the deteriorating crisis in Minnesota after a protester was shot dead on Saturday.\n\nHoman is expected to hold a press conference later today where Bovino's departure, along with that of hundreds of his agents, will be announced.\n\nThe decision is aimed at de-escalating the violence between federal agents and rioters which exploded on Saturday after the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse.\n\nBovino, the controversial face of Trump's crackdown and a close ally of Noem, sparked fury in the White House when he claimed Pretti intended to 'massacre' federal agents.\n\nTrump spent hours on Sunday and Monday watching cable news coverage and was unsettled by how the administration was being portrayed, one official told CNN.\n\nNoem branded the ICU nurse a 'domestic terrorist' and claimed he brandished a firearm, sparking further frustration among administration officials.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt distanced Trump from Noem's language on Monday, arguing that it was not a position that the President had taken.\n\nBorder Patrol chief Gregory Bovino observes a protest in Minneapolis on January 15\n\nFederal agents point weapons at protesters near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nBorder Czar Tom Homan visits 'Varney & Co.' at Fox Business Network on January 13\n\nBovino is a loyalist to Noem and her rumored lover Corey Lewandowski, and both have quietly pushed him as a potential replacement for current Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott, a longtime ally of Homan.\n\nNoem has sought to sideline Scott by having Bovino report directly to her, an unprecedented move within the agency.\n\nBovino's removal from Minneapolis underscores Noem's fading standing with the White House as Trump dispatches Homan and his closest allies to seize control of the operation on the ground.\n\nA Border Patrol veteran of 30 years, Bovino was selected last year from his role as chief patrol agent of the agency's El Centro sector in Southern California to lead highly publicized immigration crackdowns across the country.\n\nHis aggressive tactics, often highly choreographed public displays, sparked backlash from local officials.\n\nBovino often stood out as the only agent not wearing a face covering when Border Patrol descended on Home Depots and gas stations.\n\nHe has gone viral on social media as he is frequently spotted on the frontlines sporting a severe buzzcut and trench coat, which German media has likened to a 'Nazi aesthetic'.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said on X: 'Greg Bovino dressed up as if he literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb. Greg Bovino, secret police, private army, masked men, people disappearing quite literally, no due process.'\n\nA protester is pepper sprayed at close range while being detained near the site of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference at the headquarters for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to discuss a major winter storm affecting much of the country as well as the shooting death of a Minneapolis man by federal agents in Minnesota, in Washington, DC, on January 24\n\nBovino hit back, claiming he had the coat for more than 25 years and it was official Border Patrol merchandise.\n\nJenn Budd, an author and expert on Border Patrol, described Bovino as 'the Liberace' of the agency.\n\n'He was just a little Napoleon who wants you to think that he is the most moral and capable guy in the world, and everything around you is dangerous but he's the one who's going to save you,' Budd told The Times. 'It's all a show for him.'\n\nHe once invited journalists to watch him swim across a canal in Southern California's Imperial Valley in a bid to deter migrants considering the crossing.\n\nAfter Trump was re-elected Bovino used similar public relations expertise to catch the president's eye.\n\nHe sent dozens of agents to arrest migrants at gas stations along the highway ahead of Trump's inauguration.\n\nAsked why Bovino was chosen to lead the force, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told reporters bluntly: 'Because he's a badass.'\n\nBut while Bovino's strongman image earned him Trump's respect, his self-proclaimed 'turn and  burn' enforcement strategies have sparked concern.\n\nA federal judge accused Bovino in November of being 'evasive' and at times 'outright lying' in sworn testimony about an immigration crackdown in Chicago, finding his account 'simply not credible.'\n\nJudge Sara Ellis wrote that Bovino even admitted he lied about being hit with a rock before ordering tear gas used, and noted that video evidence flatly contradicted his claim that he never tackled a protester.",

    "description": "Geopolitical tensions, Trump's tariff threats, and inflation fears have helped propel gold to $5,000 for the first time ever on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Gold is surging yet again, with the metal touching $5,000 an ounce on Monday for the first time ever.\n\nBehind the latest rally is the familiar cocktail of tailwinds that are bullish for gold, but less so for other parts of the market and the economy. The \"sell America\" trade is still getting a boost, inflationary concerns linger, and fears about geopolitical crises continue to percolate.\n\nHere are the latest updates on what's driving gold's parabolic rally to all-time highs.\n\nGold jumped more than 2% on Monday as trade tensions roil markets once again after Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if it strikes any sort of trade agreement with China.\n\n\"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nGold tends to play a \"flight-to-safety\" role in markets. When investors get scared about the economic consequences of Trump upending trade with key allies, they've often flocked to the metal for shelter.\n\nThe threatening rhetoric against allies like Canada and last week's sabre-rattling from Trump about taking over Greenland sparked a return of the \"Sell America\" trade, which has boosted gold over the last year.\n\nAs gold spiked to fresh highs on Monday, the dollar index fell almost 1% against major rivals to about $96.96.\n\nOccupying a similar place in investors' minds to \"Sell America\" is the debasement trade, which continues to boost metals like gold as markets fret about other safe havens such as Treasurys.\n\nGold bulls say that a weakening of the US dollar and other fiat currencies as governments pursue aggressive fiscal policies will boost more stable stores of value.\n\nTrump's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and Jerome Powell has been the latest update that has investors fretting over currency debasement and flocking to gold. The thinking is that political meddling with monetary policy and a dovish new Fed chair could lead to lower interest rates and spur a new period of inflation down the road. Gold has long been considered a hedge against rising prices among investors.\n\nThe debasement trade was a dominant theme in markets in 2025, and analysts have eyed it as a driver of bullish forecasts for 2026.\n\nAccording to Ben McMillan, the CIO at IDX advisors, arguably the biggest driver in gold's outperformance over the last few years has been global central bank buying.\n\n\"After COVID, when America printed all this money, central banks — and it was led by China — quite literally doubled their annual purchases of gold, and they were selling Treasurys to do so,\" McMillan told Business Insider.\n\nCentral banks have also been trying to diversify their holdings away from US dollars, a trend that accelerated after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That prompted the US to freeze Russia's dollar reserves, drawing criticism over \"weaponization\" of the dollar and sparking more gold buying from countries like China.\n\nHeightened uncertainty is the heart of gold's bull case for many investors, and the geopolitical outlook looks shakier than it has in a long time.\n\nFrom Trump's moves in Venezuela, the ongoing war in Ukraine, turmoil in Iran, and a strained NATO alliance, gold bugs have a lot to worry about these days. As current conflicts stretch into 2026, analysts say they expect gold's safe-haven status to keep surging.\n\nFinally, the fear of missing out on a meme-like rally might be behind some of the moves. Gold is up 87% since the start of 2025, and has spiked 25% since October.\n\nThe gains are too good for some to watch from the sidelines.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, retail traders have been pouring money into gold recently, egged on by talk of the \"Sell America\" trade and an endless parade of bulls who say precious metals will keep rising.\n\nSilver is up even more than gold in the last year, and market pros told Business Insider that they worry the flight to safety itself has become a major investment bubble that could end badly for investors chasing the rally.",

Her mother, Amalija, worked at a local textile factory.\n\nTrump has one sister, Ines Knauss, and a half-brother, Denis Cigelnjak.\n\nMirjana Jelancic, a friend of Trump's who went on to become principal of the school, told ABC News in 2016 that the young Trump was \"an angel\" and \"a very good student.\"\n\nWhen Trump and her sister, Ines, were in high school, the Knavs family moved to Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital. There, Trump was scouted by photographer Stane Jerko and signed with a modeling agency when she was 18.\n\nTrump made the donation after her wedding in 2005, The New York Times reported.\n\nTrump is the second first lady born outside the US. The first was John Quincy Adams' wife, Louisa Catherine Adams, who was born in London.\n\nThe Rotary Klub Sevnica held events in honor of Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017 and 2025. Proceeds from the 2025 event went toward a youth scholarship fund, the Slovenian outlet Dolenjski List reported.\n\nA plaque at the site says the new bronze statue is \"dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Trump which stood in this location from 2019-2020.\"\n\nAt a 2023 naturalization ceremony held at the National Archives in Washington, DC, Trump said that becoming a US citizen is a \"life-altering experience that takes time, determination, and sometimes even tremendous strength.\" She also recalled navigating a \"labyrinth\" of paperwork to obtain a worker visa during her modeling career.\n\n\"I recall feeling a tremendous sense of pride and belonging after I recited the US oath of allegiance, as the pathway to citizenship is arduous,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two Iranian-backed militias in the Mideast are signaling their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran, as officials acknowledged the arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier to the region Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the carriers to move to the Middle East as he threatened military action over its crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nYemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels on Monday hinted they were ready to resume attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. That came just after Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group, long supported by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, issued a direct threat late Sunday toward any attack targeting Iran, warning a “total war” in the region would be a result.\n\nThe statements came as the entire region is mired in a tense waiting game to see if Trump will strike. Both the Houthis and Kataib Hezbollah sat out from Israel's 12-day war on Iran in June that saw the United States bomb Iranian nuclear sites. The hesitancy to get involved shows the disarray still affecting Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” after facing attacks from Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe threats came as the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other guided missile destroyers in its strike group arrived in the region to “promote regional security and stability,” U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.\n\nTrump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action against Iran. He has already laid out two red lines for attack — the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions of those it has arrested in a massive crackdown over the demonstrations.\n\nA senior Iranian military official who spoke anonymously on Iran's State TV dismissed the American threat as “an exaggeration” and noted that Iran had increased its military presence in response. The official added that the Lincoln's presence was not a deterrent but an accessible target.\n\nThreats from Iraq, Yemen, while Hezbollah stays mum\n\nIran projected its power across the Mideast through the “Axis of Resistance,” a network of proxy militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, and other places. It was also seen as a defensive buffer, intended to keep conflict away from Iranian borders. But it has collapsed after Israel targeted Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and others during the Gaza war. Meanwhile, rebels in 2024 overthrew Syria’s Bashar Assad after a yearslong, bloody war in which Iran backed his rule.\n\nThe Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, one of Iran's staunchest allies, refused to say how it planned to react in the case of a possible attack.\n\n“During the past two months, several parties have asked me a clear and frank question: If Israel and America go to war against Iran, will Hezbollah intervene or not?” Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Kassem said via a video address to thousands of supporters gathered in Beirut's southern suburbs for a rally backing Iran.\n\nHe said the group is preparing for “possible aggression and is determined to defend” against it. But as to how it would act, he said, “these details will be determined by the battle and we will determine them according to the interests that are present.”\n\nIraqi and Yemenite militant groups were much more forthright in their threats, which were interpreted as support for Iran. A short video by the Houthis included images of a ship on fire, with the caption: “Soon.” It later aired footage Monday from its January 2024 attack in the Gulf of Aden on the Marshall Islands-flagged tanker Marlin Luanda, one of over 100 ships attacked as part of a campaign the Houthis said pressured Israel over its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Houthis halted their fire after a ceasefire in Gaza, though they've repeatedly warned they could resume fire if needed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ahmad “Abu Hussein” al-Hamidawi of Kataib Hezbollah issued his own threat in a statement.\n\n“We affirm to the enemies that the war on the (Islamic) Republic will not be a picnic; rather, you will taste the bitterest forms of death, and nothing will remain of you in our region,” he said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced on Monday that it would not allow its airspace, territory or territorial waters to be used for military action against Iran. The UAE said it would stress dialogue and diplomatic resolutions.\n\nIran warns America not to attack\n\nIranian Defense Ministry spokesperson Gen. Reza Talaei-Nik renewed warnings Monday to both Israel and the U.S., saying any attack would “be met with a response that is more painful and more decisive than in the past.” Iranian state television quoted Talaei-Nik as saying that threats required Iran “to maintain full and comprehensive preparedness.”\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei separately told journalists: “Regional countries fully know that any security breach in the region will not affect Iran only. The lack of security is contagious.”\n\nIran over the weekend unveiled a new banner in Tehran's Enghelab Square threatening the Lincoln, showing an aircraft carrier strewn with bodies and streaked with blood with the warning: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.” However, Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war in June in which its air defense systems were broadly destroyed, top military leaders killed, and its nuclear enrichment sites bombed by the U.S.\n\nAs a sign of concern over its airspace, Iran issued a notice to pilots Sunday that banned small private aircraft from flying in the country, with carve-outs for the oil industry and emergency medical flights.\n\nMany Western airlines have started to avoid Iranian airspace entirely due to the tensions, though Gulf Arab carriers flying to Moscow still rely on the route. Iranian air defense troops in 2020 shot down a Ukrainian commercial airliner, killing 176 people on board.\n\nDeath toll rises from protest crackdown\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in its history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Monday put the death toll at 5,973, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,813 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "fullText": "MAGA podcaster Tim Pool has called out President Donald Trump in the fallout of the second fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by Department of Homeland Security federal officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in less than three weeks.\n\nThe Culture War podcast host and longtime Trump suck-up has questioned the Trump administration’s narrative surrounding the killing of ICU nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, arguing that Trump is “weak” in the face of the ensuing chaos that is gripping the Twin Cities.\n\n“Empty hand, then gun in hand,” Pool wrote, commenting on slowed footage in the seconds surrounding Pretti’s shooting. “Appears the man may have been disarmed before being shot.”\n\n“This is a chain of events in a greater conflict. Neither side cares at this point what justifies it or doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t see Trump winning this one,” Pool concluded.\n\nPool, 39, heads his own independent media group, Timcast, and has some 2.5 million followers on X. His podcast covers right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories, and has hosted white supremacist Nick Fuentes and alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos.\n\nDHS has said that the agents involved in the shooting acted in self-defence after the “armed suspect violently resisted.”\n\n“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” the department wrote in an official statement.\n\n“The suspect also had 2 magazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\"\n\nDHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference that she agrees with the White House’s statement that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist.”\n\n“This individual... committed an act of domestic terrorism. That’s the facts,” Noem argued.\n\nSimilar statements have been made by Trump’s closest political allies—including Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who branded Pretti an “assassin”—as the administration closes ranks to unify on its messaging.\n\nPool appears not to be buying any of it, although he has not entirely flipped sides. In a separate tweet, the commentator argued that those impeding the work of “federal agents dispatched by a duly elected government” are “fascists.”\n\n“Trump should personally go to Minneapolis and force the whole thing to shut down, no more fighting, no more partisan conflict,” Pool argued.\n\n“Trump isn’t Lincoln, he’s Buchanan.”\n\nPresident James Buchanan is frequently cited as the worst leader in U.S. history. The 15th president, serving from 1857 to 1861, failed to stop the country from tearing itself apart, leading to the Civil War.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz has also spurned the official White House narrative surrounding the events in his state’s capital, branding them “nonsense” and “lies.”\n\nPretti’s own parents have said that the Trump administration is spreading “sickening lies” about their deceased son that are “reprehensible and disgusting.”\n\nVideo analysis from news networks, including CNN and Bellingcat, has concluded that federal officers took the gun from the licensed firearm holder Pretti before shooting him at least 10 times while he was on the ground.\n\nProtests have engulfed Minnesota since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother of three, Renee Good, who was also killed by federal agents, not far from where today’s shooting took place.\n\nThe National Guard of Minnesota has been activated in Minneapolis as authorities work to ensure the ongoing protests remain peaceful.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a fierce national debate and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.\n\nAfter remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and \"turn over\" people who were in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network.\n\nTrump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics.\n\nTrump also told The Wall Street Journal in an interview Sunday that his administration was “reviewing everything,” but he refused to say whether the officer who shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti acted appropriately.\n\n“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not answer questions about whether Trump watched the videos of the shooting in Minnesota, which seemed to contradict the account of what happened by members of his administration, or whether he planned to speak to Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who had appealed to the president to help bring calm to the city.\n\nInstead, Trump on Sunday night said he would call on Congress to pass legislation banning so-called sanctuary cities. His administration has sought to apply the label to communities based on their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts, among other factors.\n\nHis push for action by lawmakers comes even as outrage over the shooting has raised the possibility of a partial government shutdown in a week because of a standoff over additional funding for immigration enforcement.\n\nTrump's initial reaction to the shooting of Pretti came hours after it took place on Saturday. In a post on his Truth Social network, he questioned why Pretti had a firearm and accused Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of inciting \"Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”\n\nBut throughout the weekend, Trump, who rarely lets a major moment go without comment, did not make any public appearances or express any dismay over Pretti's death.\n\nInstead, he posted online complaining about Canada and efforts to stop him from building an expansive ballroom at the White House, calling a lawsuit to block its construction “devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nHe also posted messages praising U.K. troops after his comments about them earlier in the week were widely interpreted as a grave insult and praising guests appearing on Fox News Channel.\n\nWhen he finally weighed in again Sunday night as criticism grew, Trump was unbowed.\n\nHe called on Walz and Frey, also a Democrat, to turn over for deportation anyone in the country illegally who was held in state prisons or local jails, along with anyone who has a warrant out for their arrest or a criminal history.\n\nIn his comments to The Wall Street Journal, Trump criticized Pretti for carrying a gun.\n\n“I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” Trump said. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\n\nHe said that immigration enforcement officers will leave Minneapolis “at some point” but did not offer a time frame.\n\nMembers of his administration, meanwhile, were quick to say the shooting, the second killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis by immigration officers in recent weeks, was a case of an armed man provoking violence.\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said in a post on social media, without offering any evidence, that Pretti was “an assassin” who “tried to murder federal agents.”\n\nVice President JD Vance shared Miller's post. He issued other ones blaming local officials and describing what was happening in Minneapolis as “engineered chaos” that was “the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities.”",

    "fullText": "A Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota dropped his campaign as a direct response to the way the Trump administration has carried out its immigration enforcement.\n\nOn Monday morning, Republican candidate Chris Madel posted a 10-minute video on X/Twitter announcing his decision. He explained that although he was initially supportive of the Trump administration’s mission to remove violent criminals from communities in the state, the recent actions of ICE have displayed “retribution” on U.S. citizens instead.\n\nI cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so. I support the originally stated goals of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Metro Surge, in locating and deporting the worst of the worst from our state. And I’ve seen many examples of ICE arresting non-U.S. citizens in Minnesota convicted of serious crimes, including murder, rape, and child sexual assault. No reasonable person should want these people here, and I am glad that they are gone.\n\nBut Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threats. United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a border patrol agent. That’s unconstitutional, and it’s wrong. Weaponizing criminal investigations against political opponents is unconstitutional, regardless of who is in power.\n\nI am ending my campaign for Minnesota Governor. I describe why in the below video. Please watch until the end. (It is 10 minutes, 52 seconds.)\n\nThank you,\nChris pic.twitter.com/2nfyAyTzNZ\n\n— Chris Madel (@CWMadel) January 26, 2026\n\nMadel also accused national Republicans of making it “nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” calling the ICE operation in the state an “unmitigated disaster.” His decision came two days after ICE agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti .\n\nThe post Minnesota Republican Quits Governor’s Race in Stunning Video Trashing His Own Party Over ICE’s Recent Conduct first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into Minneapolis and other cities, leading to a series of violent clashes.\n\nFootage from bystanders of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizen protesters, including Saturday’s incident that ​left an ICU nurse dead, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.\n\nCameras worn by ‌officers long have been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give ICE officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend ‌of cameras for law enforcement.\n\nOfficials last year also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.\n\nDarius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under President Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities.”\n\n“Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said.\n\nAt least three of ⁠the eight or more Border Patrol agents at the scene of Saturday's ‌shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.\n\nEFFORTS TO SLASH ICE BODY-CAM FUNDING\n\nWhen ICE or Border Patrol have engaged in acts of violence - including the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good ‍and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis - top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations.\n\nTrump has started ramping up immigration enforcement this year after Republicans in Congress passed a bill last year that provides $170 billion for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and Border Patrol operate.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in social ​media posts hours after he was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ‌unless it reins in immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection - Border Patrol’s parent agency - had 13,400 cameras for some 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.\n\nICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.\n\nThe proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.\n\nDHS says there are some 22,000 ICE officers but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.\n\nA homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last week rejected that proposal, instead providing $20 million for ICE and Border Patrol cameras.\n\nStill, the bill - ⁠which now faces a challenging route to passage in the U.S. Senate - did not require either agency to use the devices.\n\nScott ​Shuchart, a top ICE official under Biden, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations ​outside their normal operating area, an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nCOMPLAINTS UNANSWERED AS OVERSIGHT STAFF CUT\n\nThe Trump administration placed some 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal ‍agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move ⁠that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.\n\nA lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do, and left no way to address abuses.\n\nIn May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.\n\nAs of ⁠December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared to more than a hundred in March.\n\nIn 2023, OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 ‌complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) this weekend accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of applying a stark double standard in her comments made after the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis, the second such death in the city this month.\n\nIn one part of an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, which has gone viral with almost 3 million views on one X post alone, Ocasio-Cortez sharply criticized Noem’s suggestion that people should not attend protests with firearms, arguing the stance clashes with the Trump administration and conservatives’ fawning over previous armed protesters on the political right.\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem Slips Up With Awkward Typo In Heated Post About Immigrants In Minneapolis\n\nPretti was a legal gun owner who was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Minnesota law allows permit holders to carry firearms in public, including at protests. The government’s claim that he was armed and provoking violence is at odds with videos and witness statements circulating publicly.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said: “How rich is it that she is saying showing up to the scene of a protest with a legally owned weapon should be grounds for a person’s death, execution at the hands of the state, by the same party and the same administration that praises Kyle Rittenhouse?”\n\n“When she [Noem] is talking about how merely showing up and inciting violence based on ideology against the government, when this administration has pardoned hundreds of Jan. 6th rioters who have then gone out into the streets and recommitted crimes of violence over and over again,” she continued.\n\nThe New York Democrat argued the message that is being sent is solely political: “What Secretary Noem is saying is not that you can’t do these things, is not that you can’t be armed, is not that you can’t attack your government. She just thinks that you can’t do that based on your political affiliation.”\n\nPolitics: 'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nThe lawmaker also warned: “The uncorking of chaos that this administration is trying to attempt against the American people is escalatory, it is dangerous and it is a complete abdication of leadership.”\n\n“We cannot go down this road,” Ocasio-Cortez added. “We cannot have countrymen against countrymen, citizen against citizen. This is not the America that we believe in. It is not the America that we stand in and we must unite together against this kind of very dangerous splintering that they are seeking to incite against people and divide us.”\n\nEconomist Sounds Alarm On Damage Trump Is Quietly Doing To The Economy\n\nKash Patel’s Viral Line About Protesters Sparks Anger Online\n\nMelania Trump Told To 'Read The Room' Over Documentary Stunt",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump stunned members of his inner circle by calmly predicting when his own body would be lying in state, according to a new report.\n\nThe 79-year-old president reportedly made the comment at Mar-a-Lago as television screens showed Jimmy Carter’s casket at the U.S. Capitol, telling the room: “You know, within ten years that will be me.”\n\nThe remark, attributed to a person familiar with his comments, appears in a sprawling New York Magazine profile, “The Superhuman President,” about the president’s health and psyche.\n\nThe episode adds a morbid twist to how Trump and his team now talk about 2028.\n\nOne senior White House official told New York Magazine that “the specter of death sometimes manifests in the 2028 conversation,” describing aides gaming out whether the president will be willing—or able—to mount yet another run when he will be in his early 80s.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has leaned into the idea that clinging to the presidency is what keeps him alive.\n\nTrump is already the oldest person ever to be elected president.\n\nInstead of talking about slowing down, he has repeatedly teased the prospect of running again, boasting that he could seek a third term and even what would amount to a fourth term, when he is 86, even as legal experts point out the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nTrump’s brags clash with mounting unease about his health, which the Daily Beast has led the way in reporting.\n\nIn the New York Magazine piece, aides fret about his bruised hands, frequent naps in public, and a mysterious MRI trip to Walter Reed that the White House struggled to explain.\n\nFormer White House lawyer Ty Cobb warned this month that Trump’s cognitive decline is “palpable,” while prominent physician Dr. Bruce Davison told the Beast’s podcast that the president’s daily 325 mg aspirin regimen is the kind of dose usually reserved for stroke patients.\n\nInside Trump’s circle, the result is a strange dual reality, of a president who talks about death, legacy, and what he will leave behind—from a $400 million East Wing ballroom to the “Arc de Trump” he wants erected across from the Lincoln Memorial—while still casting himself as a superhuman figure who can outwork younger rivals and defy time.\n\nAs one senior official told New York Magazine, succession talk is as much about letting Trump live forever through his chosen heirs as it is about acknowledging that he will not.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "USA Rare Earth shares spiked on Monday amid the Trump administration's latest push to reduce US dependence on foreign sources of critical materials.",
    "fullText": "The move: USA Rare Earth stock jumped 20% on Monday, extending its rally from the previous Friday's close. The rare earth mining and manufacturing company has already had a strong start to 2026, with year-to-date gains of 108%.\n\nWhy: On Monday, USA Rare Earth announced that it had entered into a non-binding letter of intent with the US Department of Commerce, as part of a collaboration with the US Department of Energy to award the government agency an equity stake.\n\nUnder the agreement, the company will receive a $1.3 billion loan from the Commerce Department, as well as $277 million in federal funding. In return, USA Rare Earth will issue 16.1 million common shares and 17.6 million warrants to the department.\n\nThe agreement says that by 2030, the rare earth miner will be extracting 40,000 metric tons of critical mineral feedstock from its Round Top deposit on a daily basis. Located in Hudspeth County, West Texas, the mine is expected to begin production in 2028.\n\nWhat it means: It's the latest development in the Trump administration's push to strengthen America's domestic supply chain of critical materials and become less dependent on foreign producers. The administration has taken stakes in firms across a handful of industries, with Trump pushing for more government involvement in industries he deems crucial to US security.\n\nAs the AI boom greatly increases the need for critical minerals and rare earth elements, the White House has taken stakes in other US-based mining companies, including MP Materials, Critical Metals, and Lithium Americas. All three mining stocks also rose on the news on Monday.\n\nThis tactic of taking stakes in private firms has sparked significant momentum for mining stocks, turning the industry into one of the hottest trades of 2025. This trend looks poised to continue into 2026 as the White House adds another domestic miner to its portfolio.\n\n\"With this unprecedented show of public and private support for our Company, we are positioned to accelerate the build-out of important domestic capabilities that are essential to U.S. national security, global economic competitiveness, and critical technologies of the future,\" stated Barbara Humpton, USA Rare Earth CEO.\n\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick praised the news, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the US supply chain is not dependent on foreign countries.\n\n\"USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,\" he said.",

    "title": "\"Bitcoin Jesus\" Avoided Prison, Thanks to One of the \"Friends of Trump\"",
    "description": "Billionaire fugitive Roger Ver was facing federal criminal charges until he sought the services of a select club of President Donald Trump’s former personal attorneys who have easy access to top Justice Department appointees.",
    "fullText": "These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nDays into President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, a cryptocurrency billionaire posted a video on X to his hundreds of thousands of followers. “Please Donald Trump, I need your help,” he said, wearing a flag pin askew and seated awkwardly in an armchair. “I am an American. … Help me come home.”\n\nThe speaker, 46-year-old Roger Ver, was in fact no longer a U.S. citizen. Nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early evangelism for digital currency, Ver had renounced his citizenship more than a decade earlier. At the time of his video, Ver was under criminal indictment for millions in tax evasion and living on the Spanish island of Mallorca. His top-flight legal defense team had failed around half a dozen times to persuade the Justice Department to back down. The U.S., considering him a fugitive, was seeking his extradition from Spain, and he was likely looking at prison.\n\nOnce, prosecutors hoped to make Ver a marquee example amid concerns about widespread cryptocurrency tax evasion. They had spent eight painstaking years working the case. Just nine months after his direct-to-camera appeal, however, Ver and Trump’s new Justice Department leadership cut a remarkable deal to end his prosecution. Ver wouldn’t have to plead guilty or spend a day in prison. Instead, the government accepted a payout of $49.9 million — roughly the size of the tax bill prosecutors said he dodged in the first place — and allowed him to walk away.\n\nVer was able to pull off this coup by taking advantage of a new dynamic inside of Trump’s Department of Justice. A cottage industry of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants with close ties to Trump has sprung up to help people and companies seek leniency, often by arguing they had been victims of political persecution by the Biden administration. In his first year, Trump issued pardons or clemency to dozens of people who were convicted of various forms of white-collar crime, including major donors and political allies. Investigations have been halted. Cases have been dropped.\n\nWithin the Justice Department, a select club of Trump’s former personal attorneys have easy access to the top appointees, some of whom also previously represented Trump. It has become a dark joke among career prosecutors to refer to these lawyers as the “Friends of Trump.”\n\nThe Ver episode, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals the extent to which white-collar criminal enforcement has eroded under the Trump administration. The account is based on interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, case records and conversations with people familiar with his case.\n\nThe Trump administration has particularly upended the way tax law violators are handled. Late last year, the administration essentially dissolved the team dedicated to criminal tax enforcement, dividing responsibility among a number of other offices and divisions. Tax prosecutions fell by more than a quarter, and more than a third of the 80 experienced prosecutors working on criminal tax cases have quit.\n\nBut even amid this turmoil, Ver’s case stands out. After Ver added several of these new power brokers to his team — most importantly, former Trump attorney Chris Kise — Trump appointees commandeered the case from career prosecutors. One newly installed Justice Department leader who had previously represented Trump’s family questioned his new subordinates on whether tax evasion should be a criminal offense. Ver’s team wielded unusual control over the final deal, down to dictating that the agreement would not include the word “fraud.”\n\nIt remains the only tax prosecution the administration has killed outright.\n\nVer did not reply to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica. In court filings and dealings with the Justice Department, Ver had always denied dodging his tax bill intentionally — a key distinction between a criminal and civil tax violation — and claimed to have relied on the advice of accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n“Roger Ver took full responsibility for his gross financial misconduct to the tune of $50 million because this Department of Justice did not shy away from exposing those who cheat the system. The notion that any defendant can buy their way out of accountability under this administration is not founded in reality,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson.\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions, the White House referred ProPublica to the Justice Department.“I know of no cases like this,” said Scott Schumacher, a former tax prosecutor and the director of the graduate program in taxation at the University of Washington. It is nearly unheard of for the department to abandon an indicted criminal case years in the making. “They’re basically saying you can buy your way out of a tax evasion prosecution.”\n\nRoger Ver is not a longtime ally of Trump’s or a MAGA loyalist. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, a day he once called “the happiest day of my entire life.” In the early days of bitcoin, he controlled about 1% of the world’s supply.\n\nVer is clean-cut and fit — he has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. In his early 20s, while he was a libertarian activist in California, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for illegally selling explosives on eBay. He’s often characterized that first brush with the law as political persecution by the state. After his release, he left the U.S. for Japan.\n\nVer became a fixture in the 2010s on the budding cryptocurrency conference circuit, where he got a kick out of needling government authority and arguing that crypto was the building block of a libertarian utopia. At a 2017 blockchain conference in Aspen, Colorado, Ver announced he had raised $100 million and was seeking a location to create a new “non-country” without any central government. For years, Ver has recommended other wealthy people consider citizenship in the small Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has no individual income tax.\n\n“Bitcoin completely undermines the power of every single government on the entire planet to control the money supply, to tax people’s income to control them in any way,” he told a gathering of anarcho-capitalists in Acapulco, Mexico, in 2016. “It makes it so incredibly easy for people to hide their income or evade taxes.” More than one friend, he said with a smirk, had asked him how to do so: They “say, ‘Roger, I need your help. How do I use bitcoins to avoid paying taxes on it?’”\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship isn’t a magic get-out-of-tax-free technique. Since 2008, the U.S. has required expatriates with assets above $2 million pay a steep “exit tax” on the appreciation of all their property.\n\nIn 2024, the Justice Department indicted Ver in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency tax fraud cases. The government accused Ver of lying to the IRS twice. After Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, he claimed to the IRS that he personally did not own any bitcoin. He would later admit in his deal with the government to owning at least 130,664 bitcoin worth approximately $73.7 million at the time. Then in 2017, the government alleged, Ver tried to conceal the transfer of roughly $240 million in bitcoin from U.S. companies to his personal accounts. In all, the government said he had evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.\n\nVer’s defense was that his failure to pay taxes arose from a lack of clarity as to how tax law treated emerging cryptocurrency, good-faith accounting errors and reliance on his advisors’ advice. He claimed it was difficult to distinguish between his personal assets and his companies’ holdings and pinpoint what the bitcoin was actually worth.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Justice Department dismissed this legal argument. Prosecutors had troves of emails that they said showed Ver misleading his own attorneys and tax preparers about the extent of his bitcoin holdings. (Ver’s team accused the government of taking his statements out of context.) The asset tracing in the case was “rock solid,” according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A jury, prosecutors maintained, was unlikely to buy Ver’s defense that he made a good-faith error.\n\nIn Trump, Ver saw a possible way out. After the 2024 election, he was “barking up every tree,” said his friend Brock Pierce, a fellow ultrawealthy crypto investor who tried to gin up sympathy for Ver in Trump’s orbit.\n\nVer had initially gone the orthodox route of hiring tax attorneys from a prestigious law firm, Steptoe. Like many wealthy people in legal jeopardy, Ver now also launched a media blitz seeking a pardon from the incoming president.“If anybody knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare it’s Trump, so I think he’ll be able to see it in this case as well,” Ver said in a December 2024 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show. On Charlie Kirk’s show, Ver appeared with tape over his mouth with the word “censored” written in red ink. Laura Loomer, the Trump-friendly influencer, began posting that Ver’s prosecution was unfair. Ver paid Trump insider Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby Congress for an end to the tax provision he was accused of violating.\n\nVer’s pardon campaign fizzled. His public pressure campaign — in which he kept comparing himself to Trump — was not landing, according to Pierce. “You aren’t doing yourself any favors — shut up,” his friend recalled saying.\n\nOne objection in the White House, according to a person who works on pardons, may have been Ver’s flamboyant rejection of his American citizenship. Less than a week after Trump was inaugurated, Elon Musk weighed in, posting on X, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.”\n\nBut inside the Justice Department, Ver found an opening. The skeleton key proved to be one of the “Friends of Trump,” a seasoned defense lawyer named Christopher Kise. Kise is a longtime Florida Republican power player who served as the state’s solicitor general and has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He earned a place in Trump’s inner circle as one of the first experienced criminal defenders willing to represent the president after his 2020 election loss. Kise defended Trump in the Justice Department investigation stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and against charges that Trump mishandled classified documents when leaving the White House.\n\nKise had worked shoulder-to-shoulder on Trump’s cases with two lawyers who were now leaders in the Trump 2.0 Justice Department: Todd Blanche, who runs day-to-day operations at the department as deputy attorney general, and his associate deputy attorney general, Ketan Bhirud, who oversaw the criminal tax division prosecuting Ver. Kise reportedly helped select Blanche to join Trump’s legal team in the documents case, and he and Bhirud had both worked for Trump’s family as they fought civil fraud charges brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2022.\n\nOn Ver’s legal team, Kise worked the phones, pressing his old colleagues to rethink their prosecution against Ver.\n\nKise scored the legal team’s first big victory in years: a meeting with Bhirud that cut out the career attorneys most familiar with the merits of the case.\n\nIn that meeting, however, it wasn’t clear that the new Justice Department leadership would be willing to interfere with the trajectory of Ver’s case. While the Trump administration had backed off aggressive enforcement of white-collar crimes writ large, the administration said it was still pursuing most criminal cases that had already been charged.\n\nBhirud initially expressed skepticism that Ver accidentally underpaid his taxes. It was “hard to believe” that a man going by “Bitcoin Jesus” would have no idea how much bitcoin he owned, Bhirud said, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nBhirud and Blanche did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.\n\nThe Justice Department stuck to its position that either Ver would plead guilty to a crime, or the case would go to trial.\n\nBut Kise would not stop lobbying his former colleagues to reconsider. Blanche and Bhirud had already demanded that career officials justify the case again and again. Over the course of the summer, Kise wore down the Trump appointees’ zeal for pursuing Ver on criminal charges.\n\nKise and the law firm of Steptoe did not respond to questions.\n\n“While there were meetings and conversations with DOJ, that is not uncommon. The line attorneys remained engaged throughout the process, and the case was ultimately resolved based on the strength of the evidence,” said Bryan Skarlatos, one of Ver’s tax attorneys and a partner at Kostelanetz.\n\nIt was a chaotic moment at the Justice Department, an institution that Trump had incessantly accused of being “weaponized” against him and his supporters. After Trump took office, the department was flooded with requests to reconsider prosecutions, with defendants claiming the Biden administration had singled them out for political persecution, too.\n\nWhile many cases failed to grab the administration’s attention, Kise got results. Last week, Kise’s client Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian billionaire accused of trying to bribe the former governor of Puerto Rico, received a pardon from Trump.\n\n“Every defense attorney is running the ‘weaponization’ play. This guy gets an audience because of who he is, because his name is Chris Kise,” said a person who recently attended a high-level meeting Kise secured to talk the Justice Department down from prosecuting a client.\n\nAs Kise stepped up the pressure, Ver’s case ate up a significant share of Bhirud’s time, despite his job overseeing more than 1,000 Justice Department attorneys, according to people familiar with the matter. Ordinarily, it would be rare for a political appointee to be so involved, especially to the exclusion of career prosecutors who could weigh in on the merits.\n\nBhirud began to muse to coworkers about whether failure to pay one’s taxes should really be considered a crime. Wasn’t it more of a civil matter? It seemed to a colleague that Bhirud was aware Ver’s advocates could try to elevate the case to the White House.\n\nThe government ceded ground and offered to take prison time off the table. Eventually, Ver’s team and Bhirud hit on the deal that would baffle criminal tax experts. They agreed on a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow Ver to avoid criminal charges and prison in exchange for a payout and an agreement not to violate any more laws. The government usually reserves such an agreement for lawbreaking corporations to avoid putting large employers out of business — not for fugitive billionaires.\n\nVer’s team enjoyed a remarkable ability to dictate terms. They rejected the text of the government’s supposed final offer because it required him to admit to “fraud,” according to a person familiar with the negotiations. In the end, Ver agreed to admit only to a “willful” failure to report and pay taxes on all his bitcoin and turned over the $50 million.\n\nThe government arrived at that figure in a roundabout manner. It dropped its claim that Ver had lied on his 2017 tax return. The $50 million figure was based on how much he had evaded in taxes in 2014 alone, plus what the government asserted were interest and penalties. In the end, the deal amounted to the sum he allegedly owed in the first place. He never even had to leave Mallorca to appear in a U.S. court.\n\nUnder any previous administration, convincing the leadership of the tax division to drop an indicted criminal case and accept a monetary penalty instead would be a nonstarter. While the Justice Department settles most tax matters civilly through fines, when prosecutors do charge criminal fraud, their conviction rate is over 90%.\n\nPeople “always ask you, ‘Can’t I just pay the taxes and it’ll go away?’” said Jack Townsend, a former DOJ tax attorney. “The common answer that everybody gave — until the Trump administration — was that, no, you can’t do that.”\n\nWhen the Justice Department announced the resolution in October, it touted it as a victory.\n\n“We are pleased that Mr. Ver has taken responsibility for his past misconduct and satisfied his obligations to the American public,” Bhirud said in the Justice Department’s press release announcing the deferred prosecution agreement. “This resolution sends a clear message: whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe.”\n\nInside the Justice Department, the resolution was demoralizing: “He’s admitted he owes money, and we get money, but everything else about it stinks to high heaven,” said a current DOJ official familiar with the case. “We shouldn’t negotiate with people who are fugitives, as if they have power over us.”\n\nAmong the wealthy targets of white-collar criminal investigations, the Ver affair sent a different message. Lawyers who specialize in that kind of work told ProPublica that more and more clients are asking which of the “Friends of Trump” they should hire. One prominent criminal tax defense lawyer said he would give his clients a copy of Ver’s agreement and tell them, “These are the guys who got this done.”\n\nThe only one of Ver’s many lawyers to sign it was Christopher Kise.",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "description": "The president raised a fuss about his ballroom project as a federal judge considers an injunction.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against legal efforts to stop the construction of a massive ballroom on the grounds of the White House.\n\n“There is no practical or reasonable way to go back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “IT IS TOO LATE!”\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation last month sued to block the construction of the ballroom after Trump last year demolished the East Wing with little notice to make room for the new building, which will dwarf the main residence.\n\n“The so-called ‘preservationists,’ who get their money from the most unusual of places, should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House, a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance, because of the special grounds on which it sits, no matter how big (and important!), that enhancement may be.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon last week questioned the administration’s legal authority on the project and seemed skeptical as he considers a potential injunction. The judge said he would decide next month.\n\nTrump has said the up to $400 million cost of the ballroom will be funded by private donations, raising ethical and other questions that the White House has yet to answer.\n\nBut on Sunday, he defended the planned facility as “a great, big, beautiful gift to the United States of America” and complained that the East Wing had been “bastardized” by previous renovations.\n\nTrump also said that the lawsuit has caused “top secret” information about the project to emerge.\n\nPolitics: U.S. Senator Comes Out And Says It About Trump: 'Invoke The 25th Amendment'\n\n“Additionally, in this instance, it is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nWhile he did not get more specific, the East Wing was known to house the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ― aka the “underground bunker,” which Trump reportedly used during protests in 2020 ― and the new project is likely to replace and/or upgrade the facility.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the project, which he frequently brings up unprompted. Earlier this month, he even interrupted a White House meeting with oil industry executives to get up, wander over to a window, and stare at the construction site.\n\nTrump on Sunday fired off messages on Truth Social about a number of topics including complaints about the NFL, Canada and journalist Don Lemon. He also wrote some messages about the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis, which has only grown more tense after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nPolitics: National Trust Warns Trump's Ballroom Will 'Overwhelm' White House\n\nBut it was his message about the ballroom that he pinned to the top of his feed.\n\nThe Architect Doing Trump's Ballroom Also Thinks It's Way Too Big: Report\n\n'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nHere's Who Has Been Surprisingly Willing To Defy Trump In His Second Term",

    "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China.  Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China. He was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America’s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing.\n\nCarney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.\n\nTrump claims otherwise, posting that “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT”\n\nThe prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.\n\n“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”\n\nIn 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.\n\nBreaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.\n\nCarney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.\n\nTrump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.\n\n“A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nTrump's post on Saturday said that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”\n\n“We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“We have a (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), but based off -- based on that, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”\n\nTrump’s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance.\n\nCarney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump’s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.\n\nTrump’s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "description": "Trump posted screenshots of messages from Macron and NATO's chief, highlighting how private diplomacy — and work chats — can quickly become public.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump shared two screenshots of text exchanges with NATO Secretary General and the French President.\n\nThe posts show that even top-level diplomacy can become social media fodder.\n\nEnd-to-end apps can encrypt messages, but experts say technology can't protect against betrayal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — No more fawning praise. No more polite workarounds and old-style diplomacy. And no one is calling Donald Trump “daddy” now.\n\nEuropean leaders who scrambled for a year to figure out how to deal with an emboldened American president in his second term edged closer to saying “no,” or something diplomatically like it, to his disregard for international law and his demands for their territory. Trump's vow to take over Greenland and punish any country that resists, seems to have been the crucible.\n\n\"Red lines\" were deemed to have been crossed this year when Trump abruptly revived his demand that the United States “absolutely” must rule Greenland, the semiautonomous region that is part of NATO ally Denmark. That pushed even the most mild-mannered diplomats to issue sharp warnings against Trump, whom they had flattered withroyal treatment and fawning praise.\n\n“Britain will not yield\" its support for Greenland's sovereignty, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Several of the continent's leaders said “Europe will not be blackmailed” over Greenland.\n\n“Threats have no place among allies,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.\n\nThe tough diplomatic talk around the showdown last week in Davos, Switzerland, was not the only factor pressuring Trump. U.S. congressional elections are approaching in November amid a sinking stock market and wilting approval ratings. European leaders also are not the first to stand in Trump's way during his second term — see Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nBut the dramatic turnabout among Europe's elite, from “appeasing” Trump to defying him, offers clues in the ongoing effort among some nations of how to say “no” to a president who hates hearing it and is known to retaliate.\n\n“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it,” Trump told his audience at the World Economic Forum. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no, and we will remember.”\n\nIn recent days, Europe offered abundant refusals to go along with Trump, from his Greenland demand and joining his new Board of Peace and even to what Canada's Mark Carney called the “fiction” that the alliance functions for the benefit of any country more than the most powerful. The moment marked a unity among European leaders that they had struggled to achieve for a year.\n\n“When Europe is not divided, when we stand together and when we are clear and strong also in our willingness to stand up for ourselves, then the results will show,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said. “I think we have learned something.”\n\nFederiksen herself exemplified the learning curve. A year ago, she and other leaders were on their heels and mostly responding to the Trump administration. She found it necessary to tell reporters in February 2025, “We are not a bad ally,” after Vice President JD Vance had said Denmark was “not being a good ally.”\n\nTrump is transactional. He has little use for diplomacy and no “need (for) international law,” he told The New York Times this month. Therein lay the disconnect between typically collaborative European leaders and the Republican president when he blazed back into the White House saying he wanted the U.S. to take over Greenland, Panama and perhaps even Canada.\n\n“In Trump's first term, Europe didn't know what to expect and tried to deal with him by using the old rules of diplomacy, with the expectation that, if they kept talking to him in measured terms, that he would change his behavior and move into the club,” said Mark Shanahan, associate professor of political engagement at the University of Surrey,.\n\n“It's very hard for other leaders who deal with each other through the niceties of a rules-based system and diplomatic conversation,\" Shanahan said. \"It is hard for them to change.”\n\nFive months after Trump's inauguration last year, with his Greenland threat in the air, European leaders had gotten their heads around Trump management enough to pull off a meeting of NATO nations in the Netherlands. NATO members agreed to contribute more and widely gave Trump credit for forcing them to modernize.\n\nSecretary-General Mark Rutte, known as the coalition's “Trump whisperer,\" likened the president's role quieting the Iran-Israel war to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl.\n\nLesson 2: Consider saying no — and make choices accordingly\n\nTraditional diplomacy exists to preserve possibilities of working together. That often means avoiding saying a flat “no” if possible. But Trump's Greenland gambit was so stark a threat from one NATO member to another that Greenland's prime minister actually said the word.\n\n“Enough,” Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a statement shortly after Trump's remarks Jan. 5. “No more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation.”\n\nThat played a part in setting the tone. Denmark's leader said any such invasion of Greenland would mark the end of NATO and urged alliance members to take the threat seriously.\n\nThey did, issuing statement after statement rejecting the renewed threat. Trump responded last weekend from his golf course in Florida with a threat to charge a 10% import tax within a month on goods from eight European nations — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland. The rate, he wrote, would climb to 25% on June 1 if no deal was in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States.\n\nLesson 3: Reject Trump's big-power paradigm\n\nTrump's fighting words lit a fire among leaders arriving in Davos. But they seemed to recognize, too, that the wider Trump world left him vulnerable.\n\n“Trump was in a fairly weak position because he has a lot of other looming problems going on,” domestically, including an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision on his tariffs and a backlash to immigration raids in Minnesota, said Duncan Snidal, professor emeritus of international relations at Oxford University and the University of Chicago.\n\nCanada's Carney said no by reframing the question not as being about Greenland, but about whether it was time for European countries to build power together against a “bully\" — and his answer was yes.\n\nWithout naming the U.S. or Trump, Carney spoke bluntly: Europe, he said, should reject the big power's “coercion” and “exploitation.\" It was time to accept, he said, that a “rupture” in the alliance, not a transition, had occurred.\n\nUnsaid, Snidel pointed out, was that the rupture was very new, and though it might be difficult to repair in the future, doing so under adjusted rules remains in U.S. and European interests beyond Trump's presidency. “It's too good a deal for all of them not to,” Snidel said.\n\nBefore Trump stepped away from the podium in Davos, he had begun to back down.\n\nHe canceled his threat to use “force” to take over Greenland. Not long after, he reversed himself fully, announcing “the framework\" for a deal that would make his tariff threat unnecessary.\n\nTrump told Fox Business that “we’re going to have total access to Greenland,” under the “framework,\" without divulging what that might mean.\n\nFrederiksen hit the warning button again. In a statement, she said, “We cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"",

    "title": "Trump's surprising new source for 'affordability' ideas",
    "description": "Trump is rolling out a slew of new ideas focused on \"affordability.\" A lot of them sound like proposals from Zohran Mamdani or Bernie Sanders.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump seems to have realized the American public is not picking up what he's putting down on the economy, so he's borrowing a fresh set of ideas from an unlikely place — the other side of the aisle.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the White House has rolled out a blitz of proposals that sound more like something out of Bernie Sanders', Elizabeth Warren's, or Zohran Mamdani's offices than a Republican administration. Trump has called for institutional investors to be banned from buying single-family homes, and he's sought to block military contractors from undertaking stock buybacks and issuing dividends unless they step it up on production. He's also revived a pledge from the campaign trail to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. These moves follow a proposal late last year for what the White House dubbed \"Trump accounts,\" a small-scale version of baby bonds that would allot $1,000 to children born from 2025 through 2028.\n\nStock buyback bans, credit card interest rate caps, baby bonds: These are all ideas progressives have been kicking around for years.\n\nTrump has tended to take a heterodox approach to the economy that diverges from the more typical Republican \"let the chips fall where they may\" stance on markets. He's used his bully pulpit to stop companies from shipping jobs overseas and weighed in on mergers from the Oval Office. During his second term, the federal government has taken equity stakes in multiple American companies, marking a shift toward a more heavy-handed, interventionist approach to private industry. Now, Trump's original messaging on how to reshape the economy has faltered — it turns out Americans really love cheap stuff — so he's pivoting in what he hopes will be a more popular direction.\n\nIt's not clear how much of this is serious or achievable. And some items on Trump's agenda — namely, tariffs — stand to undercut any affordability-related measures. A cost-alleviating campaign also requires focus, and the president is prone to distraction, whether it be his recent push to acquire Greenland or his tendency to pick small fights with allies. However, the blitz of announcements is a sign that Trump recognizes his playbook wasn't appeasing the financially frustrated masses. And the ongoing shift toward more populist economic policies — wherever the ideas come from — is evidence of a broader shift away from market-first thinking that's dominated both the Republican and Democratic parties for decades.\n\nTrump's second administration came into power with a fairly cohesive theory of how to better the economy and improve Americans' poor perceptions of it. Through a combination of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and overhauling the federal government via DOGE, the Trump team anticipated an investment boom, particularly in manufacturing, that would lead to a significant boost to the economy. Things haven't really panned out as anticipated: The US lost manufacturing jobs in 2025, tariffs were mainly a headache for businesses and consumers, and while hard economic data shows solid growth, people's views on how things are going are much more dour.\n\nAmericans remain frustrated by high prices and a job market that's mediocre at best. They weren't sold on White House's initial message telling them to just buy less stuff, and the more recent line that concerns around affordability are a \"hoax\" didn't play great either. Which brings us to the White House's plan C: scrounging through various bags of tricks to see if there's anything good in there.\n\n\"They're scrambling to find things to do,\" says Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project.\n\nMany of these new policy proposals have been percolating in Democratic offices for a while. Sanders has a bill to limit credit card interest rates, and he's said in the past that he'd work with Trump on the issue. Sen. Cory Booker is a longtime proponent of baby bonds, Warren has criticized buybacks as a \"sugar high\" for corporations, and kicking private equity funds out of the housing market is a lively debate on the left.\n\nTrump's maneuvers aren't out of nowhere. He's never been a straight Reaganite, free-market-above-all Republican on the economy. Some of the issues he's targeting are ones that have garnered GOP support in the past. It's also clear that Mamdani's victory in New York City's mayoral race, thanks in large part to his affordability message, caught the president's attention. The horseshoe theory of politics suggests that the left and right are bound to intersect on certain issues, especially with a right-leaning president who is open to meddling directly into all kinds of matters. The president himself has acknowledged the atypical nature of his proposals — in an interview with CNBC, he joked that the credit card interest rate cap \"sounds like the mayor of New York maybe came up with that.\"\n\n\"Right-wing populists and left-wing progressives are both populists of a sort,\" says James Pethokoukis, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. They tend to frame things as \"the people vs. the elite,\" though their exact targets may differ. They don't worry about economic overreach or accept constraints that political moderates might take as a given.\n\n\"When someone says, 'Oh, we can't afford it,' or, 'Well, the rules don't really allow it,' Or, 'Oh, we can't do this because the markets won't like it,' I mean, those are not answers that populists and progressives like Elizabeth Warren will readily accept,\" Pethokoukis says.\n\nIn an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told me that President Trump was given a \"resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, DC's obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down.\" He said Trump is turning the page on the Biden administration's \"economic disaster\" by implementing traditional free market policies such as deregulation and tax cuts, while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\" In other words, they appear to be willing to get down and dirty on some issues.\n\nIf you're skeptical that Trump's embrace of these ideas will lead to a big bipartisan kumbaya moment, you would be correct. For one thing, the president tends to toss out declarations that aren't always straightforward or within his power to accomplish.\n\nThere are practical concerns about the feasibility and effectiveness of these plans. As it stands, there does not appear to be a political consensus on these ideas to bring them to fruition. A credit card interest rate cap, for example, would likely need congressional buy-in to implement. Historically, there has been little interest among legislators beyond progressives such as Warren, Sanders, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Members of Trump's own party have pushed back, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who suggested the president \"probably has not thought through\" the cap. The president may be able to leverage government contracts to influence defense companies, such as Raytheon, but there aren't always obvious, immediate alternative suppliers for certain products. Companies also can't shift gears overnight.\n\n\"A lot of these things they seem to be trying to do on the cheap,\" says Brad Lipton, the director of corporate power and financial regulation at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. \"It's not serious industrial policy to just kind of do these one-off things.\"\n\nThen there are the questions of effectiveness. Take the idea of banning large institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes. Entities such as Blackstone have become a \"useful scapegoat\" for rising housing costs in the US, says Jenny Schuetz, vice president of housing at Arnold Ventures, a policy advocacy group, but they're not the root of the problem. There are some 85 million single-family homes in the US; large institutions own about half a million of them, less than 1%.\n\nThere are some places where institutional investment ownership is concentrated, including Sun Belt cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, and Phoenix. While many Americans may instinctively balk at the idea of a private equity fund owning a cluster of homes, it's not unequivocally a bad thing. Having a group of houses together may help them keep down maintenance and amenities costs, and it opens up the door for renters to get into areas — and school districts — they might not be able to access if they had to buy.\n\n\"These institutional investors now operating as landlords are reallocating a very scarce good,\" says Caitlin Gorback, a microeconomist and assistant professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin's McCombs School of Business. \"When you're reallocating a scarce good, there are winners and losers. I think we've really been concerned about the losers.\"\n\nThere's only so much the federal government can do on housing at all, since most of what's needed to address the issue is on the state and local level. At the federal level, the president has also said he wants the government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds in order to bring down mortgage rates and floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage. Some economists note that those moves could actually worsen the situation by juicing demand without increasing supply.\n\n\"Huge monetary stimulus for mortgages is not really what the housing market needs right now,\" Konczal says. \"What it really needs is more housing.\"\n\nFinally, the president's own record has led many economists and policy experts to question his commitment to these causes. Trump isn't wrong to think that credit cards and debt are dogging many Americans. Credit card debt in the US is near record highs, and the average credit card interest rate is 23.79%, according to LendingTree, which is approximately 10 percentage points higher than it was a decade ago. Despite the president's rhetoric on the issue, however, his administration has actually exacerbated the problem. Last year, the president signed a resolution nullifying a Biden-era rule that would have limited overdraft fees to $5, and under his watch, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tabled a rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.\n\nIn December, the president signed a required annual defense bill that was stripped of a bipartisan housing measure aimed at increasing the housing supply and therefore bringing down costs.\n\n\"They just weren't interested,\" Lipton says.\n\nIn mid-January, Sen. Warren said in a statement she had a call with the president in which they discussed credit card interest rate limits and the housing bill.\n\n\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it. I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs,\" she said. \"No more delays. It's time to deliver relief for American families.\"\n\nThe president seems to be clear on his desire to take more direct action on the economy, though the why behind it is a separate story.\n\nOn both the right and the left, there's been a creep toward the government taking a more hands-on approach toward industry and the economy over the past decade. The Biden administration embraced industrial policy through legislation, such as the CHIPS Act, and sought to lower consumer costs by cracking down on junk fees. The Trump administration is taking stakes in companies such as Intel and MP Materials, and it's cut profit-sharing deals tied to AI chip exports. History doesn't move backward — these types of actions under both political parties are likely to continue to ramp up.\n\nWhat sets Trump's latest interventions apart is not that they borrow from progressive proposals; it's that they lack a clear thesis about the problems they're meant to solve. These policies appear reactive, shaped more by political pressure and public anger than by a coherent economic framework. They've also been presented alongside a fresh set of tariff threats on Europe that would likely push prices up. Even though those tariffs have since been abandoned, they could come back. There's an understanding from the White House that Americans are dissatisfied with the country's financial state of affairs, they increasingly blame Trump for it. Therefore, the president needs to appear like he's doing something. That something, however, is all over the place.\n\n\"A lot of policy is downstream of how you diagnose the problem, and I think their diagnosis is wrong, which is why the policies don't fit really well,\" Konczal says. \"They're doing a lot of victory laps on, 'Aha, the economy didn't collapse!' And it's like, yes, it did not. But what are we excited about? What's going to be on the other side of this?\"\n\nThat's an open question. Trump can't do a lot of this on his own, and congressional Republicans aren't exactly lining up to cap credit card interest rates or clamp down on stock buybacks and executive pay. But as the White House works to shape its affordability narrative, we might expect more Sanders-esque proposals.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "description": "Trump posted screenshots of messages from Macron and NATO's chief, highlighting how private diplomacy — and work chats — can quickly become public.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has spent years using social media to bypass diplomatic norms.\n\nNow he's going a step further: posting screenshots of seemingly private messages from world leaders for millions to see.\n\nIn two posts on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump published what appear to be private messages from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nOne message, attributed to Rutte, praised Trump's actions in Syria.\n\n\"What you accomplished in Syria today is incredible,\" the message read. It also said that Rutte planned to use media engagements at the World Economic Forum in Davos to highlight Trump's work in Syria, Gaza, and Ukraine, before turning to Greenland: \"I am committed to finding a way forward on Greenland. Can't wait to see you.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has intensified his push for the US to acquire Greenland.\n\nA NATO official confirmed the authenticity of the exchange to Business Insider.\n\nAnother screenshot showed a message from Macron addressed to Trump. In it, the French president says the two leaders are \"totally in line on Syria,\" adding, \"We can do great things on Iran.\"\n\nHowever, he questioned Trump's actions on Greenland, telling him, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland.\"\n\nThe French president's inner circle confirmed the authenticity of the message to Business Insider.\n\nTrump's decision to publish the texts underscores how even private exchanges between close allies — once assumed to be off-limits — can now become social media content, blurring the line between diplomacy and public performance, former political advisors and academics told Business Insider.\n\nJohn McTernan, who served as UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's director of political operations from 2005 to 2007, said Trump's decision to publish private messages fits a broader pattern of norm-breaking communication designed to project power and unpredictability.\n\nTrump, he said, has mastered social media as a political tool and uses it to bypass diplomatic protocol, signaling that he does not see diplomacy as a negotiation so much as an assertion of will.\n\n\"This is a man with no sense of protocol, which I think is part of the attraction to his supporters,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nJanice Stein, the Belzberg professor of Conflict Management and founding director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said publicly sharing private messages comes at a steep cost to trust.\n\nWhile such posts may deliver short-term gains with an audience, she said they encourage leaders to self-censor and erode confidence among counterparts.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs under Democratic President Barack Obama from 2014 to 2016, took a stronger view.\n\nHe said diplomacy depends on privacy and secrecy to allow leaders to test ideas and speak candidly, and that exposing private exchanges publicly risks turning diplomacy into impulsive, performative behavior with little follow-through.\n\n\"Trump's violation of that presumption of trust and secrecy is like exploding a bomb at the negotiating table,\" he said.\n\nSome messaging apps can encrypt messages end-to-end, so only the sender and recipient can read them. This protects messages from third parties like hackers, but it can't prevent the sender or recipient from sharing, screenshotting, or publishing them.\n\nRebecca Slayton, associate professor at Cornell University's department of Science and Technology Studies, said: \"The publishing of these messages is a reminder of the limits of technology for securing communications.\"\n\nThese chats offer \"very secure communications if the sender and the recipient choose to keep their communications private,\" she said, \"but the human element is always the weakest link in security.\"",

    "fullText": "Another angle of federal agents killing a Minnesota legal observer, which appears to come from the direction of the woman in pink filming from the sidewalk.\n\nObtained by Drop Site News pic.twitter.com/IT56ftPkYP\n\n— Drop Site (@DropSiteNews) January 24, 2026\n\nHarrowing new close-up video of the ICE shooting death of a Minneapolis protester showed the moments leading up to the ultimate violent act.\n\nThe nearly three-minute video, posted to the X account of AZ Intel, began with protesters blowing whistles to warn others of the presence of ICE officers.\n\nA woman holding the camera was heard yelling, “What the f*ck is wrong with you?” as ICE agents went after a man who appeared to be holding a phone to record their actions.\n\nThe agents pushed another person wearing an orange backpack to the ground, then turned their attentions back to the protester they were pursuing, appearing to spray something in the man’s face.\n\n“What the f*ck, people? What the f*ck is wrong with you?” the woman yelled as ICE agents surrounded their target and dragged him to the ground. As ICE continued to wrestle with the man, a shot rang out, followed by multiple more shots as the officers moved away from the victim.\n\nThe woman holding the camera screamed and moved away from the scene before returning and yelling repeatedly, “What the f*ck did you do?!”\n\nThe video then showed the man lying on his back motionless as the ICE officers backed away, some with guns pointed at the victim.\n\nOthers were heard screaming in the background as the person with the orange backpack ran toward the woman recording.\n\n“Oh, my God, Oh, my God! What the f*ck did you just do?” the woman yelled repeatedly as the ICE agents stood over the man.\n\n“Someone call the ambulance!” the woman yelled over and over as another person yelled “Call 9-1-1!”\n\n“Somebody call 9-1-1! I can’t believe they just did that!” the woman recording screamed. “Holy sh*t, holy sh*t!” she yelled while recording an ice agent kneeling next to the victim.\n\n“Oh, my God, you f*cking people, man! You’re f*cking killing us!” she yelled. “Why would you do that?!”\n\nOne ICE officer then prodded the victim’s leg, but the victim did not move.\n\n“I can’t believe I’m seeing this!” the woman cried as more of the officers knelt around the man.\n\nThe victim was identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nLater Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino gave a press conference during which he claimed the man had a gun and meant the agents harm.\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” he said.\n\nThe post WATCH: Stunning New Close-Range Video Of Trump Feds Shooting Man first appeared on Mediaite.",
