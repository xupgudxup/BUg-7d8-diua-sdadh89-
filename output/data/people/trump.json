    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "fullText": "For the hefty price of $1 million — plus at least $15,000 in fees — you could potentially get permanent residency in the United States.\n\nThat's the promise of President Donald Trump's \"Gold Card\" visa program, which formally launched in early December.\n\nThe program is designed to attract wealthy foreigners to the US. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at an event on Friday that the program had already raised $1.3 billion since launching.\n\nYet it also comes at a time when the Trump administration is otherwise cracking down on other legal forms of immigration.\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing the Gold Card program in September. Here's what to know about the program.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration's official website for the Gold Card, individuals can receive US residency in \"record time\" if they:\n\nProspective Gold Card holders can also include their spouses and children on their application, but for a price — specifically, an additional $1 million plus $15,000 in DHS fees per person.\n\nThere's also a \"Corporate Gold Card\" program, which allows a corporation to give one of its employees US residency for a $2 million gift.\n\nThat program also allows the Gold Card to be transferred to another employee, for a fee.\n\nAccording to the website, approved cardholders receive EB-1 or EB-2 visas.\n\nThe EB-1 visa — known colloquially as the \"Einstein visa\" — was originally intended for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, outstanding professors and researchers, and multinational managers and executives.\n\nThe EB-2 visa is for foreign nationals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities.\n\nEven as Trump rolls out the red carpet for foreigners who can pay $1 million, his administration has sought to crack down on other visas.\n\nThe most notable example is the H-1B visa, which is for high-skilled foreign workers, many of whom work in the tech sector.\n\nThe administration moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas in September, which initially caused chaos at major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee would apply to current employees who leave the country.\n\nEven more chaos came as the administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders, prompting some companies to warn their employees against travel.\n\nLast week, the administration also said it would pause the DV1 diversity visa lottery program.\n\nThe US wouldn't be the first country to establish a residence-by-investment program.\n\nIn fact, there are several countries that offer foreigners residency in exchange for payment or investment.\n\nThey include countries like Thailand, Panama, Latvia, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.\n\nThe Gold Card website also teases a \"Platinum Card,\" which they say is \"Coming Soon.\" The September executive order does not mention a Platinum Card.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, foreign nationals will be able to pay $5 million and the $15,000 DHS fees in exchange for a visa allowing them to stay in the US for 270 days without being subject to US taxes on non-US income.\n\nThat $5 million sum mirrors the $5 million originally floated by Trump officials for the Gold Card, which has since been lowered to $1 million.\n\nThe website includes a waitlist, along with a note that there's \"no assurance that the Platinum Card contribution will remain at $5 million.\"",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "fullText": "A top Republican appears to be seriously eyeing a run for the White House in 2028, which would put him on a collision course with Vice President JD Vance, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMorton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said that he believes that his longtime friend, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is seriously eyeing a run for the presidency.\n\nDuring a meeting in Washington, D.C., in November, Cruz, who has given a number of speeches decrying antisemitism in the GOP, told Klein he had been fielding requests from people urging him to seek the White House in 2028.\n\nCruz, Klein said, came across as someone “seriously” considering such a run.\n\nTwo additional sources confirmed that Cruz is weighing what would be his second presidential bid.\n\nCruz failed to gain the GOP nod in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Republican Party nomination and the White House.\n\nThe Washington Post said that Cruz in recent months has positioned himself as a voice for a more traditional, interventionist GOP foreign policy.\n\nThe senator has also called on the GOP to separate itself from former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, whom Cruz has said is injecting the “poison” of antisemitism into the Republican Party.\n\nCruz has also criticized Vance, a close ally of Carlson, to Republican donors, two people familiar with the senator’s comments told the Pose.\n\nCruz has also said that Vance’s foreign policy views are dangerously isolationist.\n\nVance is widely expected to seek the GOP nomination for president in 2028. President Trump has said that a ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be potent.\n\nVance widely leads polling on the race for the GOP nod for the White House. The veep is also the favorite of gamblers placing bets on the 2028 race on legal wagering sites.\n\n“Can Ted help craft or meld together the traditional Republican approach with the new reality of what the Republican Party is now?” said Daron Shaw, a political science professor at the University of Texas who overlapped with Cruz as a staffer on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign. “It’s a heavy lift.”",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

    "fullText": "A transgender employee of the National Security Agency is suing the Trump administration and seeking to block enforcement of a presidential executive order and other policies the employee says violate federal civil rights law.\n\nSarah O'Neill, an NSA data scientist who is transgender, is challenging President Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day executive order that required the federal government, in all operations and printed materials, to recognize only two “immutable” sexes: male and female.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit filed Monday in a U.S. District Court in Maryland, Trump's order “declares that it is the policy of the United States government to deny Ms. O’Neill’s very existence.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe order, which reflected Trump's 2024 campaign rhetoric, spurred policies that O'Neill is challenging, as well.\n\nSince Trump initial executive action, O'Neill asserts the NSA has cancelled its policy recognizing her transgender identity and “right to a workplace free of unlawful harassment,” while “prohibiting her from identifying her pronouns as female in written communications\" and “barring her from using the women’s restroom at work.”\n\nO'Neill contends those policies and the orders behind them create a hostile work environment and violate Section VII of the Civil Rights Act. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that Section VII's prohibition on discrimination based on sex applied to gender identity.\n\n“We agree that homosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex,” the court’s majority opinion stated. “But, as we’ve seen, discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.”\n\nO'Neill's lawsuit argued, “The Executive Order rejects the existence of gender identity altogether, let alone the possibility that someone’s gender identity can differ from their sex, which it characterizes as ‘gender ideology.’”\n\nIn addition to restoring her workplace rights and protections, O'Neill is seeking financial damages.\n\nTrump's order was among a flurry of executive actions he took hours after taking office. He has continued using executive action aggressively in his second presidency, prompting many legal challenges that are still working their way through the federal judiciary.",

    "description": "U. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nTrump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While ​federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status.\n\nICE and Border Patrol ‌will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 - a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July.\n\nAdministration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up ‌more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.\n\nThe expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nMiami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics.\n\n\"People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,\" said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican ⁠political strategist. \"There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.\"\n\nTrump’s ‌overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50% in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major U.S. cities, to 41% in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue.\n\nRising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining U.S. citizens.\n\nIn addition to expanding enforcement ‍actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ​the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.\n\n“I think you're going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.\n\nHoman ‌said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.\n\nSarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said U.S. businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump's immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.\n\nPierce said it will be interesting to see \"whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to U.S. cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.\n\nSome businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors walk them. Some U.S. citizens started carrying passports.\n\nDespite ⁠the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have ​not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.\n\nSome 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE ​and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6% of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of ‍U.S. citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from ⁠certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.\n\nThe administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the U.S. economy and Republican-leaning business owners.\n\nReplacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue ⁠in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress.\n\nAdministration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nSome immigration hardliners have called for more workplace enforcement.\n\n\"Eventually you’re going to have to go after these ‌employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”",

    "description": "Trump is touting tariff revenues and a shrinking trade deficit as his economic accomplishments ahead or midterms, but economists say it's complicated.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is working to sell his economic policies.\n\nTo convince the nation that the economy is improving ahead of the midterm elections, Trump is highlighting a reduced trade deficit and high tariff revenues as his key economic accomplishments since taking office.\n\nThe reality is more complicated.\n\nEconomists have told Business Insider that a smaller trade deficit and a record-breaking amount of tariff revenue can be poor indicators of overall economic health at best, and signs of economic trouble at worst.\n\n\"This idea that if we lower the trade deficit, we're going to buy from US companies and we're all better off — it's seductive for people to think that way,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank, told Business Insider. \"But it's just an incomplete view.\"\n\n'\"Unlike the budget deficit, the trade deficit is meaningless,\" Winegarden added. \"It has nothing to do with affordability, and it has nothing to do with growth, so it's a complete red herring.\"\n\nTrump is touring swing states, and he appeared on prime-time TV for a national economic address.\n\n\"Remember when I said 'tariff' — my favorite word is 'tariff,'\" Trump told a crowd in Pennsylvania, \"Tariffs are bringing us hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\n\"We had the worst trade deals ever made, and our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they're not laughing anymore,\" Trump added in the national speech last week.\n\nThe White House, in a December press release, also touted that \"the trade deficit has narrowed to its smallest since mid-2020\" in September, citing it as \"more proof that President Donald J. Trump's America First trade agenda is working.\"\n\nKimberly Clausing, professor of tax law and policy at the UCLA School of Law and a previous official at the US Department of the Treasury, told Business Insider that despite the negative association with the word \"deficit,\" a smaller trade deficit could simply mean that people are pulling back on spending and investing overall.\n\n\"In the United States in recent years, a declining trade deficit is often associated with a weak economy, due to reduced consumption and investment,\" said Clausing. \"That may be the case now as well, since some market indicators show economic weakness.\"\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the total volume of both exports and imports, adjusted for inflation, was in decline for three months preceding August.\n\nDespite a steady stock market, the US economy is showing signs of weakness.\n\nWhile inflation slowed in November, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the data may have been impacted by the government shutdown.\n\n\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the country lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in the past month.\n\nIn domestic manufacturing, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 12,706,000 employees in the sector as of September 2025, down 49,000 from a base of 12,755,000 employees at the end of January 2025, when Trump took office.\n\nWinegarden said that tariffs create an opportunity cost, because when more money is spent either by paying taxes on a foreign good or on a domestic product that is more expensive, that reduces the nation's power to buy, invest, and hire.\n\n\"When you're buying the least cost-efficient option, you're subsidizing jobs that are less efficient, and sentiments aside, that's bad for long-term job creation,\" said Winegarden.\n\nJason Furman, professor of the practice of economic policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, also told Business Insider that the perception that tariffs have decreased trade deficits may be false to begin with, and they did not create any fiscal benefits for the nation.\n\n\"The trade deficit — it has not actually narrowed. There has just been a timing shift,\" said Furman. \"What happened was a lot of imports were pulled forward and ended up being unusually large in Dec 2024 through March 2025,\"\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau's International Trade in Goods and Services report, the national trade deficit was $95.2 billion larger in the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.\n\n\"Tariffs are bringing in substantial revenue, but that revenue is largely offsetting other tax cuts done by the Trump administration,\" said Furman.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Furman added, \"A meaningful portion of the tariff revenue is coming from American consumers in the form of higher prices.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is losing what author Michael Wolff calls “reflex control,” and no one in his inner circle is willing to offer an honest assessment of his capabilities. This, Wolff claims, is leading the president to become increasingly uninhibited in his public pronouncements.\n\nDiscussing the president’s remarks this week on everything from the tragic murders of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele to the mess the FBI made of first lady Melania Trump’s underwear drawer, Wolff told his Inside Trump’s Head podcast co-host Joanna Coles that Trump is exhibiting a problem of “reflex control.”\n\nWolff also discussed comments made by Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles in a now-viral Vanity Fair story where she described the president as having an “alcoholic’s personality.”\n\n“Susie Wiles might have just as well said, ‘It’s like dealing with a dementia patient.’ I mean, it is the same thing,” Wolff explained. “And because he doesn’t drink, it is probably closer to that, in which he has the uninhibited aspects of his personality—that might be anger, or self-pity, or in his case racism—become increasingly more uninhibited, and that seems to be what’s going on. He opens his mouth and you go, ‘This is a problem.’”\n\nColes highlighted another example, from September, where Trump took the stage at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service and ranted about how much he hated his enemies. “It’s just peculiar at this stage,” Coles added. “And no one around him seems to be saying, ‘Enough already, you sound deranged.’”\n\n“It’s true, no one around them does say that,” Wolff replied, before going on to discuss the fact that the U.S. has had two octogenarian presidents back-to-back, and few people around former President Joe Biden seemed willing to break ranks and disclose his health concerns to the public.\n\n“Joe Biden had enormous cognitive difficulties, and everyone around him closed ranks to protect him until he could no longer be protected,” Wolff said, adding that there is “no way to diagnose the president.”\n\n“There is no way for us to say, ‘OK, he is experiencing cognitive issues of an alarming variety.’ And no one around him is going to say that. Although Susie Wiles, in acknowledging the alcoholic thing, was curious.”\n\nMedical experts have studied the president’s public speeches and mannerisms, as well as his documented health issues, including chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and the ever-present bandages on his hand, and concluded that he is in decline and perhaps even exhibiting signs of someone with dementia.\n\nMary Trump, the president’s niece, has echoed these concerns, noting that her grandfather—Trump’s father, Fred Sr.—lived with Alzheimer’s for many years.\n\nThe White House has continued to insist that Trump is in excellent health, even going so far as to claim that the MRI he underwent during his most recent physical exam was standard for patients his age. Medical professionals were quick to dispute this.\n\nThe president has also repeatedly bragged about “acing” three separate cognitive assessments, and has described the elementary school-level tests as being “very hard.”\n\n“He bragged about this,” said Wolff of Trump’s claim of acing the medical assessments, “which is yet another symptom, obviously, a heightened sensitivity to this issue and a defensiveness about it.”\n\n“We have a whole set of symptoms here,” Wolff said of the president. “This idea of a president’s mental health, we don’t really have a context for this, when, in fact, the context should be: this is a paramount issue.”\n\n“Obviously, if the president is unwell, we should discuss that. It actually is an issue, probably, of far greater importance than any other political issue.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung replied: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "fullText": "The leaders of Denmark and Greenland insisted Monday that the U.S. won't take over Greenland and demanded respect for their territorial integrity after President Donald Trump ‍​announced ​the appointment of a ‌special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump's announcement on Sunday that Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry would be the U.S. special envoy prompted a new flare-up of tensions over Washington's interest in the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. Denmark's foreign minister said in comments to Danish broadcasters that he plans to summon the U.S. ambassador.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\n“Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the U.S. shall not take over Greenland,” they added in the statement, emailed by Frederiksen's office. \"We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced Landry's appointment as ‌special envoy, saying that “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”\n\nLandry wrote in a post on X that “it’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.”\n\n\"However, we insist that everyone — including the U.S. — must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added.\n\nDanish broadcasters TV2 and DR reported that in comments from the Faroe Islands later Monday, Løkke Rasmussen said he will call in the U.S. ambassador in Copenhagen, Kenneth Howery, for a meeting at the ministry.\n\nBefore issuing the joint statement with Frederiksen, Nielsen wrote on Facebook that Denmark had again woken up to a new announcement from the U.S. president, but it “does not change anything for us at home.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in an annual report that the U.S. is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nDenmark is a member of the European Union as well as NATO.\n\nAnouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the EU's executive Commission, told reporters in Brussels Monday that it wasn't for him to comment on U.S. decisions. But he underlined the bloc's position that \"preserving the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark, its sovereignty and the inviolability of its borders is essential for the European Union.”",

    "fullText": "BERLIN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - German car exports to the United States slumped by almost 14% in the first three ​quarters of 2025, making it the hardest-hit branch of German ‌industry in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war, according to a study seen ‌by Reuters on Monday.\n\nUnder an agreement between Washington and Brussels, the U.S. set a 15% baseline tariff on cars from Europe from August 1 - significantly less than Trump's initial rate of 25% on top of ⁠a 2.5% existing levy.\n\nGerman ‌engineering companies have also struggled under the tariff regime, with the study showing exports in that sector ‍to the U.S. declining by 9.5% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nMachinery exports are subject to a 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminium ​products.\n\nThe chemical industry also saw exports to the country's top export ‌market decline by 9.5%, although the report said this could not be blamed solely on tariffs.\n\n\"Other factors are likely to have played a role in the case of chemical products, such as lower production in Germany due to higher energy prices,\" it said.\n\nAcross all ⁠sectors, German exports to the U.S. ​were down 7.8% year on year over ​the three quarters - following average growth of nearly 5% in the comparable periods of 2016 to 2024.\n\n\"Since it ‍must currently be ⁠assumed that U.S. import tariffs will not return to pre-Trump administration levels in the foreseeable future, a significant recovery in German ⁠exports to the U.S. is unlikely,\" study author Samina Sultan said, referring to ‌a \"new normal\" for German exporters.",

    "description": "\"60 Minutes\" abruptly dropped a segment about Trump deportees sent to a megaprison in El Salvador Sunday — two hours before it was set to air.",
    "fullText": "“60 Minutes” abruptly pulled a segment Sunday on the Trump administration deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a megaprison in El Salvador, a stunning move that comes on the heels of President Donald Trump complaining that the CBS newsmagazine has “treated him far worse” under new management.\n\nFor days, CBS had been promoting Sunday’s segment, “Inside CECOT,” which promised to reveal “brutal and torturous conditions” inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi had spoken to now released deportees, according to a Friday press release. But the segment was pulled Sunday evening, around two hours before it was to set to air.\n\n“The 60 Minutes report on ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast,” CBS told TheWrap in a statement. “We determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nAlfonsi sent an indignant internal memo to colleagues saying that pulling the segment “is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” The memo was immediately leaked.\n\nShe wrote: “If the standard for airing a story is that ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nHere is Sharyn Alfonsi’s email to her ‘60 Minutes’ colleagues in full: pic.twitter.com/ilGoSROQEs\n\n— Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) December 22, 2025\n\nAlfonsi said the segment had been screened and fact-checked by CBS lawyers and Standards and Practices. Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who watched it Friday, decided to hold it.\n\nWeiss responded on Sunday: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nBut the decision to pull such a heavily promoted and presumably hard-hitting segment on the Trump administration is sure to come under intense scrutiny given the president’s recent comments about “60 Minutes” and his relationship with David Ellison, who now runs CBS News-parent Paramount.\n\nSocial media exploded on Sunday night with criticism of Weiss, declaring that she had failed her own standard that she announced in ascending to the role of running CBS News, “to seek the truth and tell it plainly.”\n\n“If this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn’t a news division anymore. It’s TASS,” said veteran reporter Bill Carter, referring to the Soviet-era news agency.\n\nIf this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn't a news division anymore. It's TASS. https://t.co/RjjZNX7nHm\n\n— Bill Carter (@wjcarter) December 22, 2025\n\nBut “60 Minutes” has lately run afoul of Trump yet again. Earlier this month, after “60 Minutes” aired an interview with his former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump referenced the settlement in taking aim at ownership.\n\nLast week, Trump unloaded again, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies.”\n\nTrump sued CBS last year over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with his then-2024 rival, Kamala Harris. The network initially dismissed Trump’s suit as “without merit” and vowed to “vigorously defend” itself. But CBS-parent Paramount settled with Trump for $16 million in July as the company was seeking FCC approval to merge with Ellison’s Skydance.\n\nSince the merger, Ellison appointed Weiss, the co-founder of the Free Press, to serve as editor-in-chief. Trump has praised Weiss in the past, as well as Ellison, who is now vying to takeover Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN. Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is a Trump supporter.\n\nTrump returned to “60 Minutes” last month for his first interview since the settlement. “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nWatch a teaser for the “60 Minutes” segment below:\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y\n\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 21, 2025\n\nThe post ‘60 Minutes’ Abruptly Pulls Segment on Trump Deportees Sent to El Salvador Megaprison appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump ‍on Sunday ​announced ​he ⁠is appointing Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as the U.S. ‌special envoy to Greenland, the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the U.S. needs to take over.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in announcing the appointment.\n\nTrump during his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\nThe issue had drifted out of the headlines in recent months, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nEarlier this year, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base on the island and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nTrump has said that Greenland is crucial for U.S. security and hasn’t ruled out taking the island by military force, even though Denmark is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nLandry took office as governor in January 2024. His term ends in January 2028.\n\n“It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote in a posting on X in which he thanked Trump for the appointment. He added, \"This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nDenmark, a NATO ally of the U.S., and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. gathering intelligence there. The U.S. push for Greenland is also opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\nThe Embassy of Denmark in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Landry's appointment.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nThe service, in its annual assessment, said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\n\"The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the U.S. diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of President Donald Trump’s “America First” priorities.\n\nThe chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.\n\nAll of them had taken up their posts in the Biden administration but had survived an initial purge in the early months of Trump’s second term that targeted mainly political appointees. That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "The DOJ removed already-public Epstein files in defiance of a disclosure statute, prompting bipartisan outrage and impeachment talk from the law’s authors.",
    "fullText": "(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Justice Department is now engaged in an open cover-up carried out in direct violation of federal law.\n\nOver the weekend, the department quietly removed 16 photographs from the Epstein files website it created to comply with a disclosure statute passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. The removals came without notice or explanation. Among the deleted images was one of the few photographs that even indirectly featured Trump, a picture of a credenza drawer inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan home containing other photographs, including at least one of Trump. Twelve others depicted Epstein’s third-floor massage room, a central crime scene in the federal investigation. Some images of the same room remain public. Others disappeared.\n\nWhen Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked whether the Trump-related image had been taken down, the Justice Department declined to respond.\n\nWhat followed made matters worse.\n\nIn a post on X quoting Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department claimed that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Blanche’s original post asserted that the department had released Epstein materials “under the Epstein Files Transparency Act” and that additional disclosures would follow “as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”\n\nThat explanation fails under the statute the department invoked.\n\nCongress did not authorize a rolling review. The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related materials in its possession. The law imposes a mandatory disclosure obligation and permits only limited redactions to protect victims. It grants no authority to retract, revise, or curate records after release. Once the department published those materials, the law required that they remain available to the public.\n\nRemoving them placed the department in direct conflict with the statute Congress enacted.\n\nThat conflict was immediately recognized. Blanche’s post received a community note stating that the law requires the release of all files and allows only narrow redactions to protect victims, adding that the department’s partial release and extensive redactions violated the statute. The Justice Department’s own post received a community note citing the statute directly and stating that retractions and redactions to protect politically exposed persons are not permitted. Community Notes appear only when users with differing political viewpoints agree on their accuracy, underscoring how broadly that conclusion was shared.\n\nThe department’s own explanation confirms it is violating the law it claims to follow.\n\nThe sequence exposes motive. The files went live. Political reaction followed. The department then altered the public record. Compliance held only until presidential exposure appeared, then gave way to erasure.\n\nIn November, I described the Trump Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein files as a cover-up. Last week, I wrote that the administration’s delay in disclosure created a political problem rather than an immediate legal one. That assessment reflected weak enforcement mechanisms and an approach built on delay rather than open defiance.\n\nRemoving already released material that implicates the president converts a credibility crisis into a statutory violation and a far larger political emergency. Congress passed the Epstein disclosure statute precisely to eliminate executive discretion. Lawmakers acted because the Justice Department repeatedly demonstrated it could not be trusted to manage politically sensitive material involving powerful figures. The law mandated disclosure to prevent executive self-protection.\n\nThe department seized that discretion anyway.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had lawful options. She could have sought judicial review. She could have consulted Congress. She could have acknowledged that the statute permits no removal authority and sought amendment. Each path would have preserved institutional legitimacy. She chose concealment and false justification instead.\n\nThis erasure differs from earlier Trump-era document fights in a crucial way. Prior disputes centered on whether materials must be disclosed. This episode involves evidence already released to the public under statutory standards. The department determined the images satisfied the law’s requirements, then removed them once the political cost became apparent.\n\nEvery disclosure statute now faces the same test: compliance survives only until it threatens the president. Months of delay, sweeping redactions, and staged releases already convinced much of the public that the Justice Department prioritized Trump’s standing over transparency, victims, and the public interest. The image removals confirm that conclusion decisively.\n\nA Justice Department that edits evidence to shield the president forfeits legitimacy. Oversight collapses when obedience ends at political inconvenience. The rule of law depends on statutes binding the executive even when compliance proves costly.\n\nCongress wrote a law to prevent exactly this abuse. The president signed it. The attorney general is now violating it to protect him. That meets any reasonable standard for impeachment.\n\nThe backlash on Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who forced the House vote compelling disclosure, both said the Justice Department failed to comply with the law. Khanna has confirmed that he and Massie are drafting impeachment and contempt measures against Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nCongress now faces a choice. It can accept that disclosure laws apply only when politically painless. It can normalize the disappearance of already public evidence. It can allow executive power to override legislative command.\n\nOr it can enforce the law it wrote.\n\nThis is a cover-up enforced through executive defiance. The question now is whether Congress will enforce its own laws.\n\nThe post Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — When Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest convention reached its halfway point, Erika Kirk tried to put a smiling face on things.\n\n“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk, who has led the influential conservative organization since her husband Charlie was assassinated in September. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”\n\nSome of the biggest names in conservative media took turns torching each other on the main stage, spending more time targeting right-wing rivals than their left-wing opponents.\n\nThe feuds could ultimately define the boundaries of the Republican Party and determine the future of President Donald Trump's fractious coalition, which appears primed for more schisms in the months and years ahead.\n\nHere are some of the most notable moments from the four-day conference.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, set the tone with the first speech after Erika Kirk opened the convention. He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

    "description": "From tariff rebate checks, to bonuses, to Trump accounts, to DOGE dividends, here's all the free money Trump has floated giving to Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump really wants to send you a check.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has pledged to send Americans money in various ways, including tariff rebate checks and bonuses to select government employees.\n\nSome of that free money is becoming a reality: Congress created \"Trump Accounts\" as part of the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which will provide tax-free federal grants of $1,000 to children born in the next few years.\n\nOthers remain elusive, or have fallen by the wayside. Remember the DOGE dividend?\n\nTrump also sent out checks during his first term, but under much different circumstances. As part of two successive COVID-era stimulus bills, the federal government sent Americans $1,200 in the spring of 2020 and $600 in the winter, shortly before the president left office.\n\nTrump's signature appeared on those checks, which was a source of controversy during a presidential election year.\n\nIn February, investor James Fishback floated the idea of sending $5,000 \"DOGE Dividend\" checks to almost 80 million taxpaying American households.\n\nThose checks would be paid for by spending cuts achieved by DOGE, the government efficiency office led by Elon Musk at the time.\n\nThe idea quickly caught Musk's attention, and Trump eventually said that they were under consideration.\n\nBut there were some problems. For one, the $5,000 figure was based on Musk's original estimate of $2 trillion in savings, which never materialized.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also balked at the idea, saying they preferred to see a reduction in the national debt.\n\nThe idea eventually faded, though Trump's political operation has continued to float the idea in fundraising emails.\n\nWhile defending tariffs in a November Truth Social post, Trump said his administration would pay \"everyone\" except \"high income people\" a dividend of at least $2,000.\n\nAlthough Trump's Truth Social posts are not actual government orders, the statement drew attention from citizens and his colleagues in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published an analysis the following day, stating that there would not be enough tariff revenue to support the idea.\n\n\"With our national debt quickly approaching an all-time high and annual budget deficits approaching $2 trillion per year, it is imperative that policymakers focus on actually reducing deficits and putting debt on a downward path,\" the committee wrote.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent also pushed back on Trump's dividend remark during an ABC News interview, saying there were no plans to spend tariff revenue.\n\nTrump would also need approval from Congress to pass such an order, which seems unlikely given the lack of enthusiasm from Republican members.\n\n\"We're facing a deficit this year around $2 trillion,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters. \"I think whatever revenue we get, from whatever source, ought to go to try and bring down those deficits.\"\n\nThe longest government shutdown in US history began on October 1, spanning 43 days while Democrats and Republicans in Congress negotiated a new budget.\n\nThe fallout forced the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others — such as air traffic controllers — had to continue working without pay ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday rush.\n\nAir traffic controllers received their first $0 paychecks in late October. Some of them stopped showing up for work, sparking a staffing shortage and an onslaught of flight delays and cancellations.\n\n\"They're confronted with a decision: Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions,\" Duffys said. \"I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, criticized the air traffic controllers who had not shown up for work during the shutdown in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe said air traffic controllers who didn't take time off during the shutdown were \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for each of them.\n\nDuffy shared more details in an X post, writing that 776 air traffic controllers would receive $10,000 bonus checks in early December.\n\n\"Santa's coming to town a little early,\" Duffy wrote.\n\nTrump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" into law on July 4, implementing new tax policies and changes to federal programs, including SNAP.\n\nThe bill also introduced so-called Trump Accounts, which are specialized retirement accounts for US children. They were previously referred to as \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or MAGA accounts.\n\nThe Trump administration said children born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, who open Trump Accounts, would receive a one-time $1,000 tax-free federal grant. US children with a valid Social Security number are eligible. Friends, family, and others are allowed to deposit another $5,000 tax-free into those accounts.\n\nThe White House said several CEOs agreed to invest in Trump Accounts, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell pledged to invest $6.25 billion to support Invest America, the federal program that spearheaded Trump Accounts.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio has also pledged to deposit $250 into the Trump Accounts of 300,000 Connecticut children. Some large companies, like BlackRock, have offered a $1,000 match for the children of eligible employees.\n\nDuring an economic address to Americans in December, Trump said his administration would provide bonus checks to members of the military before Christmas.\n\nIn a subsequent news release, the newly rebranded Department of War said Trump is giving service members bonus checks to \"thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the US military has been defending the nation.\"\n\nThe checks, dubbed the \"Warrior Dividend,\" are each worth $1,776.\n\n\"Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill. Approximately 1.28 million active-duty and 174,000 reserve component military members will receive the dividend as a nontaxable supplement to their regular monthly housing allowance,\" the Department of War said.\n\nThe department said eligible service members can expect to see the payment before December 20.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "description": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ.",
    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Famous singer, songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews took to his band’s TikTok page on Thursday to make a few critical remarks about Donald Trump.\n\nThe six-minute video features Matthews walking around Brooklyn, New York, where he says he’s visiting family.\n\nHe then goes on to talk about how when people talk to themselves now, it’s usually on the phone. He first brings up Trump by mentioning the strikes on the alleged Venezuelan drug boats.\n\n“There’s little evidence to support their actions,” he says in the video. “And pretending its all the fake drugs but really it’s a way to claiming a war against Venezuela so we can steal their oil.”\n\nHe also says the evidence of that is the full pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who helped funnel cocaine into the United States.\n\n“If you’re fighting drugs, I don’t know if you should be forgiving the guy who brought 10 flat beds of cocaine into the country,” Matthews said.\n\nMatthews also brings up Hilary Clinton, Israel’s actions against Gaza and Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\n\n“The attacks on immigrants and different populations seems pretty racist,” he said.\n\nHis final remark is on how Trump reacted after the murders of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner.\n\n“What a disgusting human being Donald Trump is. What a shallow, horrifying selfish, greedy, cruel little pig he is,” Matthew said.\n\nMatthews rock band, Dave Matthews Band was formed in 1991 and is expecting to have four performances in Cancun in January.",

    "title": "Trump talks about neuroses, selecting chairs and his wife’s underwear drawer in latest affordability speech",
    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Several key Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Josh Hawley, have been outspoken against federal AI preemption.",
    "fullText": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

    "description": "The Kennedy Center added Donald Trump's name to its facade on Friday. Here's a look back at how it came to be and how it has changed under Trump.",
    "fullText": "With his White House renovations already underway, President Donald Trump is now leaving his mark on the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe day after the Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted to change the name, new signage appeared on the building's facade on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nOriginally established by Congress in 1958 as an \"artistic mecca\" for the performing arts in the nation's capital, the National Cultural Center was officially renamed in memory of President John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963. Since its opening in 1971, the center has hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as a range of events and exhibits across genres.\n\nSince the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, changing its name requires congressional approval. That hasn't stopped the Center's Trump-appointed board from implementing the change on the building as well as its website. Whether the name sticks remains to be seen.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the Center came to be and its changes under Trump's leadership so far.\n\nOriginally named the National Cultural Center, the act authorized the construction of the building and established it as an independent institution with a mission to host arts and culture events, as well as educational programming.\n\nKennedy Onassis and Mamie Eisenhower served as honorary co-chairwomen of the project.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act in January 1964 to change the name and provide $23 million in federal funds for its construction.\n\nAfter signing the bill, Johnson handed the pen to Edward Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's brother.\n\n\"As this center comes to reflect and advance the greatness of America, consider then those glories were purchased by a valiant leader who never swerved from duty — John Kennedy. And in his name I dedicate this site,\" Johnson said at the groundbreaking ceremony, held in December 1964.\n\nDesigned by architect Edward Durell Stone, the Kennedy Center was built on the banks of the Potomac River using 3,700 tons of marble gifted to the US from Italy.\n\nFor its opening event, the Kennedy Center hosted a performance of \"Mass\" by Leonard Bernstein, which was commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe first Kennedy Center honorees included Fred Astaire, Marian Anderson, George Balanchine, Arthur Rubinstein, and Richard Rodgers.\n\nBeyoncé brought the Kennedy Center to its feet with a fiery tribute to Tina Turner in 2005, and President Barack Obama shed tears while watching Aretha Franklin perform \"Natural Woman\" to honor Carole King in 2015.\n\nTrump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, but has taken a much more active role in shaping the institution in his second non-consecutive term.\n\nAfter taking office earlier this year, he fired the president and Biden-appointed members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, replacing them with allies and members of his administration. The board went on to elect Trump as its chairman.\n\nWhile visiting the performance venue in March, Trump told board members that the building was in \"bad shape\" and said he planned to renovate the space.\n\n\"We're going to make a lot of changes, including the seats, the décor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nAt the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 7, honorees received newly designed medallions from Tiffany, featuring blue ribbons instead of the traditional rainbow colors.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that the board had \"unanimously\" voted to change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center, and the website was updated to reflect the change.\n\nTrump's name was added to the building's signage on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"honored,\" while Democratic lawmakers and members of the Kennedy family criticized the president.\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, contested the White House's claim of a unanimous vote, writing on X that \"microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,\" while Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, wrote on X that the change is not acceptable.\n\nSix Democratic lawmakers said in a statement that Trump was \"attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for New York governor and will not seek reelection to Congress, abruptly bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Bruce Blakeman, a county official in New York City’s suburbs. But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A storied Wall Street law firm that hemorrhaged talent after bending the knee to President Donald Trump has announced plans to merge with a much larger firm in a bid to save its practice.\n\nCadwalader, Wickersham & Taft had been actively looking for a merger partner after many of its top attorneys left over the firm’s decision to pledge $100 million in pro bono work to support the president’s priorities, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nLast spring, the president signed a series of executive orders stripping attorneys from certain firms of their security clearances, limiting their access to government buildings, and terminating government contracts with the firms.\n\nWhile some firms like Cadwalader made deals with the administration to avoid a similar punishment, others fought the orders and won big in court, adding to the humiliation of the capitulating firms.\n\nIn the wake of the firm’s deal with Trump, key partner groups at Cadwalader, which was founded in 1792 and is Wall Street’s oldest firm, quickly began making lateral moves to other practices, Above the Law reported.\n\nThe firm, which brings in about $638 million in annual revenue, is now merging with Hogan Lovells, which brought in nearly $3 billion last year, more than quadruple the size of Cadwalader, according to Above the Law.\n\nHogan Lovells’ chief executive, Miguel Zaldivar Jr., will lead the combined firm, according to the Journal. Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.\n\nThe decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "description": "I spent a month in her head. I was surprised by what I found.",
    "fullText": "When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.\n\nI did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.\n\nSo that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.\n\nYes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.\n\nAt a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)\n\nSo Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.\n\nOn some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.\n\nAnd so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”\n\nWhen I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.\n\nBefore she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.\n\nMiller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”\n\nMiller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.\n\nWeston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.\n\nGlenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nAs for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”\n\nMiller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”\n\nShe worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.\n\nMiller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.\n\nThe world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.\n\nAug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.\n\nAug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)\n\nThe interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”\n\nMiller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.\n\nBack then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.\n\nMiller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.\n\n“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”\n\nMultiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)\n\nIn 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.\n\n“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.\n\nHer ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”\n\nThe paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.\n\nThe Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”\n\nAfter a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”\n\nNarratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.\n\nAnd Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.\n\n“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”\n\nMiller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”\n\nShe continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”\n\nAfter college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.\n\nThat soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.\n\nShe never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.\n\nBut before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”\n\nThe paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.\n\n“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”\n\nThat part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”\n\nBut the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.\n\nBritt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”\n\nMiller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”\n\nThere is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.\n\nThe podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.\n\n“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”\n\nIf I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWhere is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?\n\nIt’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.\n\nFor right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?\n\nAnd for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?\n\nIt is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.\n\nThe most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.\n\nOne viewer left a comment: “We are not a serious country.”",

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "A cardiac expert has warned he is “seriously concerned” about President Donald Trump’s health after watching his “manic” address to the nation.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a medical analyst for CNN who served as the late Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist for over 30 years, posted a series of alarmed statements on X as Trump delivered his accelerated address.\n\nTrump sped through the 18-minute address, often taking an angry tone, and occasionally shouting the words he was reading off a teleprompter.\n\n“The pace of this address is manic,” Reiner wrote, noting that the tone of the speech also did not match the Christmas decorations displayed behind Trump.\n\nThe president squeezed in a brief festive greeting at the end, without cracking a smile.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned about the health of the president,” Reiner said of the 79-year-old, adding that, “No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s health has been an ongoing concern this year, from his bruised hand to nodding off in Cabinet meetings.\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner fact-checked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when she announced that Trump’s second health check in a year included a “preventative MRI” to examine his heart and abdomen.\n\n“Well, there really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Reiner said.\n\n“This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging,” Reiner continued, saying the White House’s messaging had a “weird and defensive, evasive tone” to it.\n\nHe also pointed out that “preventative” abdominal imaging was especially peculiar.\n\n“This obviously was performed in response to some clinical concern, which is fine. Things happen to people as we all get older, and the president is almost 80,” said Reiner, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in D.C. “So, instead of this kind of evasive, almost laughable kind of note, just spell out what happened.\n\n“I hope the imaging is normal and great; that would be excellent news,” Reiner added. “But this kind of piece-by-piece, drip-by-drip release of information is just concerning.”\n\nThe breakneck pace and loud volume of Trump’s speech was also discussed on CNN’s NewsNight on Wednesday.\n\nOne theory is that CBS factored in a maximum 22-minute presidential interruption for Trump’s speech as part of the three-hour Survivor finale, which is always a ratings hit.\n\n“He was loud, he was forceful, he was fast,” author and journalist Terry Moran said of Trump.\n\n“The networks only gave him 15 minutes, supposedly. And that is a problem for him because he likes to ramble, he likes to improvise, and he sounded like a man shouting at the nation that entire time.”\n\nMoran said while Trump listed off “great things” he had done for the economy, “the facts of people’s own lives will refute you.”\n\n“I thought that was a huge mistake,” Moran said. “People think this economy is very bad for them personally and he’s shouting at them.”\n\nCNN political analyst and co-host on The View Ana Navarro said the speech was “18 minutes of their lives” people would never get back.\n\n“It was an angry old man shouting from the hills, shouting at the kids to get off their lawn,” Navarro said.\n\nShe said, “He interrupted the finale of Survivor, which has 4.5 million viewers. There’s a lot of Survivor fans for this old man to come and scream about how everything is great.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump suspended the green card lottery program on Thursday that allowed the suspect in the Brown University and MIT shootings to come to the United States.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on the social platform X that, at Trump’s direction, she is ordering the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the program.\n\n“This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,” she said of the suspect, Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente.\n\nNeves Valente, 48, is suspected in the shootings at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, and the killing of an MIT professor. He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

    "fullText": "Deal will allow app to continue operating in US as Elizabeth Warren condemns Trump and his ‘billionaire buddies’\n\nTikTok has signed a deal to sell its US business to three American investors – Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX – ensuring the popular social video platform can continue operating in the United States.\n\nThe deal is expected to close on 22 January, according to an internal memo seen by he Associated Press and Reuters. The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "A new poll indicates that support for President Trump is dwindling. Shockingly, that decline seems to be chiefly among MAGA and party-line Republicans. Support for the MAGA movement has also declined, with more Republicans identifying with the party rather than with Trump.\n\nThe new NBC News poll shows that the number of Americans who “strongly approve” of Trump has dropped from 26% in April to 21% now. The same survey also found the number of MAGA Republicans dropped from 78% to 70% in the same period.\n\nOn the flip side, the number of people who “strongly disapprove” of Trump increased from 42% to 44% from April to now. MAGA itself has also seen a decline since April, with the number of Republicans viewing themselves as part of the movement falling from 57% to 50%.\n\nMany of those surveyed cited financial concerns, particularly those surrounding food, affordable housing, and health care, as being the most critical issue to them. Many households are tightening their belts by cutting back on groceries, entertainment, and holiday spending.\n\nWhile overall inflation is down to 3%, costs have decreased for only a few goods, and wages haven’t increased meaningfully for most workers. As a result, some economists fear that stagflation might be a risk heading into 2026. Trump’s promise to end inflation and revitalize the economy has rang hollow for many voters. After a year, the majority of those surveyed found themselves in the same or worse position than a year ago.\n\nThe erosion is subtle but notable. Republican voters are not necessarily moving left, but they are showing fatigue with personality-driven politics. The poll suggests a growing desire for stability, predictability, and concrete economic relief. Whether that sentiment translates into lower turnout, primary challenges, or quiet disengagement could shape the party’s strategy heading into the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nThe post Poll Shows Shocking Trump Approval Number Change appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

    "title": "Trump Is Doubling Down on His Disastrous A.I. Chip Policy",
    "description": "National security shouldn’t ever have a price.",
    "fullText": "President Trump announced last week that he would allow China to buy an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, from the American company Nvidia, doubling down on a misguided decision he made over the summer to sell China another advanced chip, the H20. The H200 is about six times as powerful and will be an even greater boon to China’s military and A.I. development.\n\nMr. Trump explained that in return, the U.S. government will charge a 25 percent fee on all sales of the H200. But U.S. national security and technological dominance shouldn’t ever have a price — let alone such a low one.\n\nFor years, both the Trump and Biden administrations had successfully sought as large a lead as possible over China in A.I. In 2018, the first Trump administration wisely cut off key companies in China from the most advanced chip-making equipment. In 2020, Mr. Trump helped reverse the deployment of nonsecure Chinese 5G telecommunications networks by Britain and other allies by banning the sale of advanced chips to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Biden administration substantially expanded those controls and added new ones. Both administrations said that China would use American-made chips to develop more sophisticated A.I. and modernize its military.\n\nHampered by those policies, China has struggled to make advanced A.I. chips, despite a push of around $200 billion starting in 2014. None of China’s chips are close to matching the capacity of the H200. Huawei, a leading Chinese chipmaker, projects that it will not be able to match the H200’s performance until the end of 2027 at the earliest — and even that estimate sounds optimistic.\n\nIn addition to making less capable chips, China struggles to make them in large quantities. Trump administration officials testified in June that China will make just 200,000 chips per year — not even enough for a single data center. By contrast, Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the democratic world will produce more than 10 million far-superior chips per year. All told, China will produce a total computing power that is a mere 1 percent to 3 percent of what U.S. companies will produce.\n\nThe chief executive of DeepSeek, a prominent A.I. company in China, admitted in 2024 that access to chips was the company’s biggest impediment. In the summer of 2025, DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to train a new system on Chinese chips. When DeepSeek released its latest model several weeks ago, it acknowledged that the system still lags behind U.S. versions and cited computing limitations as the key reason.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s announcement last week, Chinese companies jumped at the chance to buy the H200 — more evidence that America’s chip advantage is real.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that selling chips to China will keep China “addicted” to American products and undermine its efforts to improve production. But China knows better. In the days since Mr. Trump announced his decision to sell the H200, there have been reports that China will invest an additional $70 billion to improve its domestic production of chips. According to a report on Sunday in the Global Times, which is controlled by China’s ruling party, Nvidia’s advanced chips would be used only until Chinese tech companies can transition to domestic alternatives.\n\nIt’s all part of the same pattern, whether the product is solar panels, electric vehicles or telecommunications: China imports Western technology until its own production catches up; then it cuts out American companies. President Xi Jinping has long said that relying on others for core technology “is like building a house on someone else’s foundation.”\n\nIt should be obvious that the United States should not sell China advanced technology that China could use to target American troops and intelligence officers. Advanced A.I. will improve China’s cyber operations, intelligence analysis and weaponry. According to reports, the Trump White House has concluded that Alibaba, one of China’s biggest A.I. companies, provides technology support for the Chinese military, including some of its operations against U.S. targets. (Alibaba has denied this claim.) Other reports suggest that DeepSeek evades U.S. export controls and aids Chinese military and intelligence operations. Chinese procurement documents show that the People’s Liberation Army is also trying to get its hands on advanced U.S. chips.\n\nThe bipartisan House committee on China was right when it said last week that China will use the H200 to “strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” and when it recommended tightening export controls rather than loosening them.\n\nThe Trump administration is well aware of how much A.I. matters to national security, which makes its decision even more baffling. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, last week proclaimed, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled ‘A.I.’” And when the Department of Justice recently announced charges against two individuals accused of smuggling H200s to China, it underscored the national security issues: “These chips are the building blocks of A.I. superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control A.I. technology; the country that controls A.I. technology will control the future.”\n\nFor now, that country is the United States. In 2017, Li Keqiang, China’s premier at the time, told Mr. Trump during a meeting in Beijing that China would come to dominate all technologies, including A.I., and that America would export little more than soybeans and corn. Last week’s decision helps make that unlikely dream a reality.\n\nBen Buchanan is an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an adviser to A.I. and cybersecurity companies.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is easing some federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday that will reclassify marijuana to a Schedule III drug, putting it on par with drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n\n\"We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain,\" Trump said during an event in the Oval Office, flanked by several doctors.\n\nThe order falls short of fully legalizing marijuana, but it will make it easier for researchers to study the drug.\n\nTrump said that he had been lobbied to make the change by people with extreme pain, incurable diseases, and seizure disorders, among others. The president noted the substance's medical uses, including as a \"substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers.\"\n\nThe move could also bring tax relief to marijuana businesses operating in states that have already legalized the substance.\n\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a category for substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nSchedule III drugs, on the other hand, have a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\nMarijuana stocks surged last week amid widespread rumors of Trump's impending order. Most of the sector's most prominent names continued trending upward with this week on mounting speculation for the pro-cannabis policy decision.\n\nNews of Trump signing the executive order continued to boost the industry's biggest players. Tilray Brands, typically seen as a leader among cannabis stocks, jumped 6% today while Aurora Cannabis rose 9% and Canopy Growth Corporation spiked 11%.\n\nThese cannabis stocks are all relatively small cap and are prone to price swings, but the signing of an executive order is a highly bullish catalyst for the industry.\n\nAs he campaigned for a third time in 2024, Trump signaled that he would take a friendlier approach toward marijuana than he did during his first term.\n\n\"I promised to be the president of common sense, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" Trump said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida aimed at legalizing marijuana for recreational use in the state. That measure garnered 56% of the vote but ultimately fell short of the 60% required for passage.\n\nTrump also said in 2024 that he supported enacting laws to make it easier for marijuana businesses to operate.",

    "description": "A Kennedy Center Board member accused the White House of lying about the vote to change the center's name to the Trump Kennedy Center.",
    "fullText": "A Kennedy Center board member accused the White House of lying about the organization’s “unanimous” vote to change the center’s name to the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” claiming that her dissent was censored.\n\nOn Thursday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced that the Trump-controlled board “voted unanimously” for the name change. Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus. This is censorship. https://t.co/D1zGV7xiWV pic.twitter.com/npNvSIy6sV\n\n— Rep. Joyce Beatty (@RepBeatty) December 18, 2025\n\nShe continued: “Clearly, the Congress has a say in this. This center – the Kennedy Center – was created by the Congress. I think it is important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law, and not let the people have a say.”\n\nThe president named himself a chairman of the Kennedy Center earlier this year after taking office. He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy,” Tim Shriver, JFK’s nephew, wrote on X. “Would they rename the Lincoln Memorial? The Jefferson? That would be an insult to great presidents. This too is an insult to a great president.”\n\nPerhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is 𝗧𝗛𝗘 memorial to the president of the United States, John F. Kennedy.

Kennedy,” Shriver, JFK’s niece, wrote. “It was named in his honor. He was a man who was interested in the arts, interested in culture, interested in education, language, history. He brought the arts into the White House, and he and my Aunt Jackie amplified the arts, celebrated the arts, stood up for the arts and artists.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center was named after my uncle, President John F Kennedy.

It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable. It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "Trump Was Slammed For Leveling This 'Disgusting' 3-Word Phrase — And It Might Reveal A Lot",
    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says the U.S. is on the cusp of something “this country has never seen” — and he’s crediting his much-discussed tariff policy.\n\nSpeaking at a White House Christmas reception, Trump argued that tariffs are driving a manufacturing revival, pointing to the auto industry as a prime example (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Our car industry … went to Europe, they went to Mexico, Japan — they went all over. They went to South Korea,” Trump said. “And now it’s just the opposite. They’re all coming back. We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which this country has never seen.”\n\nTrump pointed to Toyota, which recently announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years (2). According to Trump, companies are increasingly choosing to build in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\n\n“So they’re coming from Germany, they’re coming from Japan, they’re coming from Canada. Many factories are coming in because they don’t want to pay tariffs — very simple. They’re coming in and they’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said.\n\nThe result, Trump says, could be a historic economic upswing.\n\n“We have a country that potentially is geared to have the most incredible golden years ever,” he said, adding that when factories open up “by the thousands,” it would mark “the golden age of America.”\n\nTo be sure, that manufacturing boom has yet to materialize. According to the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month in November (3).\n\nStill, Trump insists the turnaround is coming soon.\n\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year. I think you’ll see results — we’ve never had anything like it,” he said.\n\nWhile Trump’s tariff policies have drawn criticism, major companies continue to view the U.S. as one of the most dependable places to build and grow. That confidence is showing up in the scale of capital they’re committing — across multiple industries.\n\nFor instance, Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). Hyundai, meanwhile, is investing $26 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).",

    "fullText": "Former model Stacey Williams said Donald Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 while her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein watched on in what she described as “some sort of twisted game.”\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Friday deadline to release the remaining Epstein files, the 57-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model opened up to The Daily Beast Podcast about her brief relationship with the late sex offender when she was in her twenties and he was in his forties.\n\nWilliams told host Joanna Coles that she met Epstein at a dinner party with other models, “and that’s how I started dating him, which led to, obviously, months later, him walking me into Trump Tower to be groped, assaulted by Donald Trump while the two men stood there and walked and talked as it was happening.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were close friends for many years until a bitter falling-out, supposedly over Epstein poaching Trump’s staff.\n\nIn retrospect, Williams said, it made sense why Epstein kept directing her toward Trump Tower while they were out on a walk and convinced her to “just drop by and see him.”\n\n“I do remember little snippets of Trump saying, ‘Oh yeah, her career is on fire.’ You know, that thing that he does: ‘Everything’s the best,’” she said. “And Jeffrey just kept—he didn’t intervene. He watched it, and then he raged at me in the elevator and on the way down that I allowed it to happen. You know, either it was some sort of twisted game, and he didn’t get the result he wanted. Maybe it was a bet. I don’t know, but I’m confident that that is what occurred.”\n\nShe ended her romance with Epstein soon after.\n\n“I just said, ‘Jeffrey, you are extremely mentally ill and you need to get help. There’s something deeply wrong with you. And stop calling me. I don’t want anything to do with you.’ And he, oddly enough—this is hard for people to understand—but he got weepy. He was very sad.”\n\nThe model previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that Trump “came out of his office right outside of, in sort of the waiting area, and started groping me while the two of them continued having a casual conversation… He’s just moving his hands sort of up and down my body and, like, smiling at him. And Jeffrey smiling back.”\n\nWilliams first went public with her allegations against Trump on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call last year. Though she told NBC News at the time that she had no communications with the Kamala Harris campaign team, that didn’t stop the White House from accusing her of having political motivations.\n\n“These accusations were unequivocally false when they were first contrived and nothing has changed. Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than President Trump’s tremendous successes,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly said, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false.”\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump’s Department of Justice must release the federal investigation files related to the disgraced financier by Friday.\n\nThe co-author of the law, California Democrat Ro Khanna, warned that Justice Department officials “could be subject to prosecution given the federal law” and “hauled in front of Congress, the Oversight Committee” if they fail to release the files on time.\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

    "fullText": "Donald Trump drew rare bipartisan agreement with his address to the nation on Wednesday, with people across the political spectrum asking on social media just what was the point of the speech.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) led the mockery of the president’s comments ― which were heavy on baseless boasts and light on much else ― in a series of posts.\n\nIn one, the potential Democratic 2028 presidential candidate summed up “Trump tonight” with one word, “Me,” which he repeated many times.\n\nTrump tonight:\n\nMe Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me…\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 18, 2025\n\nNewson, who’s said his online trolling of Trump in recent months is intended to shine a light on the president’s most ridiculous and divisive antics, also suggested the whole speech “could have been an email.”\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 18, 2025\n\nHis press office also sarcastically chimed in:\n\nMany are saying that was a better speech than the Gettysburg Address.\n\n— Governor Newsom Press Office (@GovPressOffice) December 18, 2025\n\nAs did lawmakers, media commentators from both sides of the aisle, and others:\n\nFor someone who’s “winning” so much, why is Trump so mad? https://t.co/thog1hFmMV\n\n— Rep.

    "description": "Trump was applauded by MAGA allies for his economic-focused primetime address, despite polls showing that most voters are feeling the opposite.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump was showered with praise by GOP lawmakers and MAGA allies as he insisted that the economy is stronger than how most Americans feel in a primetime speech from the White House.\n\nDuring an 18-minute address, Trump attacked his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and touted his record on immigration, tariffs and culture issues, arguing that the “Golden Age” he proposed on the campaign trail is building momentum. He also announced his administration will be sending $1,776 bonuses, which he called “warrior dividends,” to nearly 1.5 million U.S. service members before Christmas.\n\n“I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said Wednesday night.\n\nThe speech came as Trump has oscillated on his messaging on the economy, boasting it as the “best” to repeatedly labeling affordability as a “hoax” — all while polls show that voters need convincing.\n\nAn NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released hours before he spoke found that the president’s economic approval hit a new low at 36%. A new Fox News poll revealed similar, with most voters believing the economy is in bad shape.\n\nBut while his address was ruthlessly ripped by Democrats, his supporters were singing an entirely different tune.\n\n“He very clearly said to the American people, ‘I see you,’ and look at the things we’ve done,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) said on Fox News. “What he has accomplished in just these first 10, 11 months is remarkable, but I think more is yet to come.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich dubbed Trump’s address as “worthy of Ronald Reagan.”\n\n“That was a good speech. It was an important speech,” Gingrich said on Fox News. “Someday, people will say it was one of the most important speeches of his career because it set the table for the entire debate over the next year.”\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) supported the president’s attacks against the Affordable Care Act, as subsidies are set to expire by the end of the month.\n\n“Republicans will fix what Democrats broke!” he wrote.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also weighed in on X: “High energy, great delivery, grand slam, home run on making the case that the best is yet to come.”\n\nA popular MAGA account posted that Trump “just shows up and performs under pressure.”\n\n“We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes,” the user wrote. “I couldn’t feel more secure with him steering the ship.”\n\nIn the background, the economy remains one of the top concerns of voters heading into the 2026 midterm elections, which could be seen as a litmus test for Trump and the GOP as they look to maintain control of the House and Senate.\n\nAfter Democrats scored sweeping victories in November, Trump has since increased his focus on the key issue.\n\n“I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” Trump said during a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania last week. “They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”",

    "fullText": "The move: Trump Media & Technology Group stock surged as much as 34% on Thursday. The parent company of Truth Social has struggled in 2025, with shares down 60% year-to-date.\n\nWhy: Trump Media is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal worth $6 billion.\n\nThe combined company is expected to complete a utility-scale fusion power plant in the coming year, creating one of the first publicly traded fusion energy companies to date.\n\nThe announcement from TAE casts the deal as a part of the push to advance US interests in the AI space, in addition to energy security.\n\n\"Trump Media & Technology Group built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations.\"\n\n\"Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant, and dependable electricity that would help America win the A.I. revolution and maintain its global economic dominance,\" the statement added.\n\nWhat it means: President Donald Trump has been focused on advancing US AI dominance over rivals like China. The deal is being viewed as an AI play as much as an announcement in the energy space.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said investors should view the deal as a positive signal for both the tech and energy sectors.\n\n\"We expect Big Tech to focus on partnering/looking to acquire future energy sources over the coming years to fuel their AI ambitions as energy remains the biggest constraint in my view,\" he said. \"This is an arms race both between US Big Tech and more broadly between the US and China heading into a key 2026 which will further define the winners in this AI Revolution.\"",

    "fullText": "Melania Trump held the Bible as Donald Trump was sworn in for his second non-consecutive term, and the couple danced together at several inaugural balls later that evening.\n\nFor the swearing-in ceremony, Melania Trump wore a navy coat and skirt by Adam Lippes, an American designer. She accessorized with a matching wide-brimmed hat by Eric Javits.\n\nHer black-and-white inaugural gown was designed by Hervé Pierre.\n\nThe service, the last of Donald Trump's inaugural events, was held at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC.\n\nMelania Trump joined Donald Trump to visit Los Angeles in the aftermath of multiple wildfires and neighborhoods in North Carolina damaged by Hurricane Helene.\n\nTogether, they met with first responders and residents who had lost their homes and businesses.

June 14 was also Donald Trump's 79th birthday.\n\nMelania Trump escorted Donald Trump onstage for his remarks at the event, but did not issue any statement of her own. She wore a pinstriped ivory skirt suit by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe first couple watched the July Fourth fireworks display from the White House. They also hosted a military family picnic on the South Lawn earlier in the day.\n\nAlso that day, Donald Trump signed his tax and spending bill, which he dubbed his \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" after it was passed by the House of Representatives on July 3.\n\nShe wore a white shirtdress by Thom Browne.\n\nThe first couple visited Texas a week after the Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes as rain battered the region, leaving more than 130 dead.

We are grieving with you. Our nation is grieving with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Melania Trump watched Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nDonald Trump, who received both cheers and boos at the game, called it \"a great match.\"\n\nMelania Trump watched the game from behind her bright-white Dior sunglasses, which resembled the Vuarnet glasses worn by Sam Altman at Sun Valley just days earlier. She wore them with a black-and-white Michael Kors outfit.\n\nThe task force was created in April as part of Donald Trump's executive order, \"Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education For American Youth.\"\n\n\"Our future is no longer science fiction,\" Melania Trump said at the meeting. \"During this primitive stage, it is our duty to treat AI as we would our own children — empowering, but with watchful guidance.\"\n\nThe first lady wore a gray striped suit with a white shirt and belt.\n\nThe guest list included Mark Zuckerberg, Sam Altman, and Tim Cook among over a dozen tech and AI executives. Elon Musk was not in attendance, though he sent a representative to the event.\n\nDuring the dinner, Altman called Donald Trump a \"pro-business, pro-innovation president,\" and Cook thanked the president for \"helping companies around the world\" and the first lady for \"focusing on education.\"\n\nMelania Trump changed into a black outfit for the gathering.\n\nThey observed a moment of silence in memory of those who were killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nDonald Trump and Melania Trump disembarked from Air Force One at London Stansted Airport and were greeted by British soldiers and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.\n\nA horse-drawn carriage ride transported them to Windsor Castle, where troops were assembled in a Guard of Honor.

Bush aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMelania Trump wrote a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in August, urging him to end the war in Ukraine to restore the \"melodic laughter\" of children displaced by the conflict.\n\nIn October, she announced that her \"open channel of communication\" with Putin had helped reunite eight Ukrainian children with their families.\n\nNeither dressed up in a Halloween costume — Donald Trump wore one of his signature red hats, and Melania Trump wore a brown coat with orange trim by Marni.\n\nIn the East Room of the White House, Trump signed an executive order aimed at strengthening the foster care system as part of Melania Trump's new \"Fostering the Future\" initiative.\n\nThe program, an extension of the first lady's \"Be Best\" initiative, aims to enhance opportunities for young people in foster care, including connecting them with educational and employment resources.\n\n\"This Executive Order, 'Fostering the Future for American Children and Families, ' gives me tremendous pride,\" Melania Trump wrote on X. \"It is both empathetic and strategic.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: UK government’s ‘naive belief’ that Trump is a good faith actor ‘could cost UK taxpayer billions’, says health select committee chair\n\nMinisters and senior MPs have warned that the UK’s agreements with Donald Trump are “built on sand” after the Guardian established that the deal to avoid drug tariffs has no underlying text beyond limited headline terms.\n\nThe “milestone” US-UK deal announced this month on pharmaceuticals, which will mean the NHS pays more for medicines in exchange for a promise of zero tariffs on the industry, still lacks a legal footing beyond top lines contained in two government press releases.\n\nConcerns over the basis of the agreement have been heightened by Washington’s decision to suspend the £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, which had been hailed as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US”. The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nIt has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” by Keir Starmer in May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.\n\nThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the department shared its press release hailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to the equivalent US government announcement of an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.\n\nCritics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.\n\nDavid Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.\n\n“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”\n\nOrdinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.\n\nMinisters privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.\n\nOne said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with the Trump administration were “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.\n\nLayla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”\n\nLiam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.\n\nGovernment figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.\n\nOfficials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.\n\n“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”\n\nIssues have emerged in the implementation of the landmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.\n\n“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”\n\nApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%, although other countries pay a rate of 50%.\n\nOne industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.\n\nThe US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nSeveral officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.\n\n“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.\n\n“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”",

    "description": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nSeizing the vessel, one of Caracas’ sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump’s campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWithin days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president’s economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.\n\n“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.\n\nInsiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro’s government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.\n\n“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.\n\nThis is the plan behind Mr Trump’s unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.\n\nPerched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to prop up his country.\n\nBeneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela’s $24bn in exports.\n\nSince 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.\n\nIn his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.\n\nTo get around this, Mr Maduro’s government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nHundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.\n\nIt is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.\n\nThe tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.\n\n“What they’re doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n\nIndeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump’s chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.\n\n“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.\n\n“It’s very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”\n\nRelations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.\n\nYet thanks to the export of Venezuela’s oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.\n\nNone have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.\n\nBeijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.\n\nThe repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.\n\nThe blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing’s ports.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.\n\n“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that’s going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don’t start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.\n\n“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”\n\nBeijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America’s backyard of Chinese influence.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.\n\nIn that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.\n\nCuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.\n\nMr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.\n\n“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”\n\nWhile China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.\n\nA Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.\n\nIndeed, signs of Moscow’s shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.\n\nExperts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.\n\n“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.\n\nFor months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.\n\nUS navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.\n\nEight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.\n\nThey are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.\n\nIt has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.\n\nThe blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.\n\nInstead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.\n\nFor the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro’s power.\n\nAs long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.\n\nThe same logic applies to Mr Maduro’s alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.\n\n“It doesn’t take us yet to the place where we’re going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We’re still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.\n\nThe formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump’s continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.\n\nTop military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro’s security detail or operations to seize the country’s oil fields.\n\nIn each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.\n\nMr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.\n\nSo what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.\n\nWhat happens next will be determined by Mr Trump’s blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.\n\nBut if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.\n\nThe gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is promising more checks.\n\nIn an economic address to the nation that aired during prime time on Wednesday, Trump said $1,776 in bonus checks would be sent to military members for Christmas — and that tariffs are funding the payments.\n\nIt is unclear if the checks are legal and can be made without the approval of Congress, which has the constitutional power to enact a budget and appropriate funds.\n\nThe speech comes as Trump works to sell the nation on his economic plans.\n\nAccording to a NPR/PBS News Marist Poll earlier in December, Trump's economic rating hit a low this term, with only 36% saying they approve of how the president is handling the economy.\n\nIn a recent interview with Politico, Trump said he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"\n\nTrump is embarking on an economic tour across swing states to campaign for Republican candidates in the midterms. In his first stop in Philadelphia, he defended his tariffs and called the Democrats' criticism that his policies are driving up prices a \"hoax.\"\n\nTrump had also promised other checks in the past. He's floated such a $2,000 tariff dividend for every American below a certain income level, though congressional Republicans have balked at the idea. And he announced a $10,000 bonuse to select Transportation Security Administration employees for remaining at their posts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",
