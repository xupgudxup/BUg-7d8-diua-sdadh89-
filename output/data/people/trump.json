    "title": "The Supreme Court is about to weigh in on the Fed's independence in a case that goes beyond Jerome Powell",
    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

Let's get loud!\"\n\nPuerto Rican singer Bad Bunny has already been announced as the headline act for the Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nHis appearance polarised opinion as he had said in an interview with i-D magazine he was avoiding the US on his world tour out of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents might conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nResponding to Bad Bunny's booking for Super Bowl, Trump said on NewsMax's Greg Kelly Reports: \"I've never heard of him. I don't know who he is.\"\n\nSuper Bowl 60 takes place in Santa Clara, California on February 8.\n\nTrump attended last year's Super Bowl, where he saw the Kansas City Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles, but it is not yet known if he will be present this year.\n\nNotable half-time performances in recent years have included Beyonce, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna.",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

    "description": "Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.  It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.  “When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "description": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia.

    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s made the stunning move, late Saturday, to snub GOP Senator Bill Cassidy (LA) and instead back his would-be primary opponent.\n\nIn a Saturday night Truth Social post, the president announced his support for Rep. Julia Letlow (R-LA) to take on Cassidy in the primary.\n\n“Highly Respected America First Congresswoman, Julia Letlow, of the wonderful State of Louisiana, is a Great Star, has been from the very beginning, and only gets better!” Trump wrote. “I am hearing that Julia is considering launching her Campaign for the United States Senate in Louisiana, a place I love and WON BIG, six times, including Primaries, in 2016, 2020, and 2024!”\n\nHe added, “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!”\n\nCassidy has bent over backwards to try to get back in Trump’s good graces since voting to convict him in his second impeachment trial in 2021. Most notably, the senator — who is a licensed physician — cast the crucial vote to advance the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary. Since then, Cassidy has criticized Kennedy’s stance on vaccines on numerous occasions\n\nIn response to Trump’s snub, Cassidy posted on X, “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”\n\nI'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\n\n— Bill Cassidy, M.D. (@BillCassidy) January 18, 2026\n\nThe move is likely to complicate the GOP’s slender 53-47 majority in the Senate. Already, outgoing Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) have proven to be tough votes for Republican Senate leadership to secure on various measures. The New York Times reported that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) pushed Trump to consider the potential ramifications on future votes by opposing Cassidy, but to no avail.\n\nThe post Trump Spurns GOP Senator — Gives ‘Complete and Total Endorsement’ to His Likely Primary Foe in Shocking Move first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A tiny Swiss ski town with a population of just over 10,000 will play host this week to a clash between two American politicians, President Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and their radically different visions of the future of capitalism.\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that he will travel more than 6,000 miles to make his return to Davos, Switzerland, to speak this week at the World Economic Forum.\n\nOpponents criticized Newsom for being an out-of-touch \"Davos Democrat\" for attending the elite gathering of business and world leaders at least five times while he was mayor of San Francisco between 2004 and 2011.\n\nNewsom's return to the annual gathering of business and political elites is all about displaying a forceful rebuke to President Donald Trump on the world stage as Newsom potentially prepares a run for president, political experts told Business Insider.\n\n\"Newsom's arrival at Davos confirms his desire to be seen as the Democratic Party leader and go-to guy for world leaders wanting an alternative to President Trump,\" Sally Susman, a longtime democratic fundraiser, said.\n\nIn speeches and meetings, Newsom plans to argue that Trump's economic agenda has been a failure that other leaders should not be part of, Izzy Gardon, a Newsom spokesperson, said.\n\n\"The Governor will be bringing an extra suitcase of kneepads for anyone lining up to bend the knee to Donald Trump,\" Gardon said.\n\nNewsom himself did not shy away from the main reason he is returning: to counterpunch Trump. The president will speak on Wednesday, a day before Newsom.\n\n\"Trump's economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not 'America First' but 'Trump First' — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,\" Newsom said in a statement. \"At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures.\"\n\nNewsom, who has yet to officially announce his candidacy, looks more presidential rubbing shoulders at a gathering of world leaders than he would staying in Sacramento, according to Ambassador Derek Shearer, the Chevalier Professor of Diplomacy at Occidental College.\n\n\"By coming to Davos, he can combine his role as the leading Democratic critic of Trump and as a serious contender to replace him as president,\" Shearer said. \"Of course, it's a high-stakes game, but so far, he is playing it well.\"\n\nNewsom will be rubbing shoulders with some of the richest people in the world at a time when some billionaires are fleeing California ahead of a ballot proposal that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents with a net worth of more than $1 billion.\n\nNewsom has said he opposes the measure. It is yet to be seen if he will address the matter at Davos.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump announced the audacious capture of Nicolás Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in the U.S., he portrayed the strongman’s vice president and longtime aide as America’s preferred partner to stabilize Venezuela amid a scourge of drugs, corruption and economic mayhem.\n\nLeft unspoken was the cloud of suspicion that long surrounded Delcy Rodríguez before she became acting president of the beleaguered nation earlier this month.\n\nIn fact, Rodríguez has been on the radar of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration for years and in 2022 was even labeled a “priority target,” a designation DEA reserves for suspects believed to have a “significant impact” on the drug trade, according to records obtained by The Associated Press and more than a half dozen current and former U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nThe DEA has amassed a detailed intelligence file on Rodríguez dating to at least 2018, the records show, cataloging her known associates and allegations ranging from drug trafficking to gold smuggling. One confidential informant told the DEA in early 2021 that Rodríguez was using hotels in the Caribbean resort of Isla Margarita “as a front to launder money,” the records show. As recently as last year she was linked to Maduro’s alleged bag man, Alex Saab, whom U.S. authorities arrested in 2020 on money laundering charges.\n\nThe U.S. government has never publicly accused Rodríguez of any criminal wrongdoing. Notably for Maduro’s inner circle, she’s not among the more than a dozen current Venezuelan officials charged with drug trafficking alongside the ousted president.\n\nRodríguez’s name has surfaced in nearly a dozen DEA investigations, several of which remain ongoing, involving agents in field offices from Paraguay and Ecuador to Phoenix and New York, the AP learned. The AP could not determine the specific focus of each investigation.\n\nThree current and former DEA agents who reviewed the records at the request of AP said they indicate an intense interest in Rodríguez throughout much of her tenure as vice president, which began in 2018. They were not authorized to discuss DEA investigations and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe records reviewed by AP do not make clear why Rodríguez was elevated to a “priority target,” a designation that requires extensive documentation to justify additional investigative resources. The agency has hundreds of priority targets at any given moment, and having the label does not necessarily lead to being charged criminally.\n\n“She was on the rise, so it’s not surprising that she might become a high-priority target with her role,” said Kurt Lunkenheimer, a former federal prosecutor in Miami who has handled multiple cases related to Venezuela. “The issue is when people talk about you and you become a high-priority target, there’s a difference between that and evidence supporting an indictment.”\n\nVenezuela's communications ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe DEA and U.S. Justice Department also did not respond to requests for comment. Asked whether the president trusts Rodríguez, the White House referred AP to Trump’s earlier remarks on a “very good talk” he had with the acting president Wednesday, one day before she met in Caracas with CIA Director John Ratcliffe.\n\nAlmost immediately after Maduro’s capture, Trump started heaping praise on Rodríguez — this past week referring to her as a \"terrific person — in close contact with officials in Washington, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe DEA’s interest in Rodríguez comes even as Trump has sought to install her as the steward of American interests to navigate a volatile post-Maduro Venezuela, said Steve Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, a think tank focused on organized crime in the Americas.\n\n“The current Venezuela government is a criminal-hybrid regime. The only way you reach a position of power in the regime is by, at the very least, abetting criminal activities,” said Dudley, who has investigated Venezuela for years. “This isn’t a bug in the system. This is the system.”\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by opposition leader María Corina Machado, who met with Trump at the White House Thursday in a bid to push for more U.S. support for Venezuelan democracy.\n\n“The American justice system has sufficient information about her,” said Machado, referring to Rodríguez. “Her profile is quite clear.”\n\nRodríguez, 56, worked her way to the apex of power in Venezuela as a loyal aide to Maduro, with whom she shares a deep-seated leftist bent stemming from her socialist father’s death in police custody when she was only 7 years old. Despite blaming the U.S. for her father’s death, she steadily worked while foreign minister and later vice president to court American investment during the first Trump administration, hiring lobbyists close to Trump and even ordering the state oil company to make a $500,000 donation to his inaugural committee.\n\nThe charm offensive flopped when Trump, urged on by Rubio, pressured Maduro to hold free and fair elections. In September 2018,the White House sanctioned Rodríguez, describing her as key to Maduro’s grip on power and ability to “solidify his authoritarian rule.” She was also sanctioned earlier by the European Union.\n\nBut those allegations focused on her threat to Venezuela’s democracy, not any alleged involvement in corruption.\n\n“Venezuela is a failed state that supports terrorism, corruption, human rights abuses and drug trafficking at the highest echelons. There is nothing political about this analysis,” said Rob Zachariasiewicz, a longtime former DEA agent who led investigations into top Venezuelan officials and is now a managing partner at Elicius Intelligence, a specialist investigations firm. “Delcy Rodríguez has been part of this criminal enterprise.”\n\nThe DEA records seen by AP provide an unprecedented glimpse into the agency’s interest in Rodríguez. Much of it was driven by the agency’s elite Special Operations Division, the same Virginia-based unit that worked with prosecutors in Manhattan to indict Maduro.\n\nOne of the records cites an unnamed confidential informant linking Rodríguez to hotels in Margarita Island that are allegedly used as a front to launder money. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the information.\n\nThe U.S. has long considered the resort island, northeast of the Venezuelan mainland, a strategic hub for drug trafficking routes to the Caribbean and Europe. Numerous traffickers have been arrested or taken haven there over the years, including representatives of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel.\n\nThe records also indicate the feds were looking at Rodríguez’s involvement in government contracts awarded to Maduro’s ally Saab — investigations that remain ongoing even after President Joe Biden pardoned him in 2023 as part of a prisoner swap for Americans imprisoned in Venezuela.\n\nThe Colombian businessman rose to become one of Venezuela’s top fixers as U.S. sanctions cut off its access to hard currency and Western banks. He was arrested in 2020 on federal charges of money laundering while traveling from Venezuela to Iran to negotiate oil deals helping both countries circumvent sanctions.\n\nIn an unrelated matter, the DEA records also indicate agents’ interest in Rodríguez’s possible involvement in allegedly corrupt deals between the government and Omar Nassif-Sruji, a relative of a longtime romantic partner of Rodríguez's, Yussef Nassif.\n\nNassif-Sruji did not respond to emails and text messages seeking comment and an attorney for Nassif denied his client was involved in any nefarious activity, pointing out that he hasn't been accused of any crime.\n\n\"He has the utmost respect and confidence in the acting president's vision for Venezuela and believes she is a true patriot who has committed her entire life to the betterment of the Venezuelan people,\" the attorney, Jihad M. Smaili, said in a statement. “The insinuations that Mr. Nassif is currently involved in any untoward relationship with the acting president are false.”\n\nTaken together, the DEA investigations underscore how power has long been exercised in Venezuela, which is ranked as the world’s third most corrupt country by Transparency International. For Rodríguez, they also represent something of a razor-sharp sword over her head, breathing life to Trump’s threat soon after Maduro’s ouster that she would “pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro” if she didn’t fall in line. The president added that he wanted her to provide the U.S. “total access” to the country’s vast oil reserves and other natural resources.\n\n“Just being a leader in a highly corrupted regime for over a decade makes it logical that she is a priority target for investigation,” said David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has studied Venezuela for three decades. “She surely knows this, and it gives the U.S. government leverage over her. She may fear that if she does not do as the Trump administration demands, she could end up with an indictment like Maduro.”\n\nMustian reported from New York.\n\nContact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "title": "Trump 25% tariff on European allies until Denmark sells Greenland to US",
    "description": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested",
    "fullText": "Heads of state across Europe respond in solidarity with Denmark and Greenland, and boycott of World Cup suggested\n\nDonald Trump threatened a 25% tariff on a slew of European countries including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland, in an extraordinary escalation of the president’s bid to claim the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Saturday on Truth Social, Trump said he would impose a 10% tariff on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland beginning 1 February, “on any and all goods sent to the United States of America”.\n\nHe said the tariff will increase to 25% on 1 June.\n\n“This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump said.\n\nThe president’s longstanding interest in acquiring Greenland “one way or the other” has become a fixation since the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro earlier in January. While he has claimed the Arctic territory’s current status poses a national security threat to the US, this has been disputed by US allies, including Denmark.\n\nIn the Saturday morning post, Trump said forces from the eight European nations “have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown”. It was an apparent reference to Nato allies deploying troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.\n\n“The President’s statement comes as a surprise,” Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark’s foreign minister, responded on social media. “Earlier this week, we had a constructive meeting with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. The purpose of the increased military presence in Greenland, to which the President refers, is to enhance security in the Arctic.”\n\n“Every insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,” Rasmus Jarlov, the conservative chair of Denmark’s defence committee, wrote in more direct language. “The answer from Denmark and Greenland is final: We will never hand over Greenland. We pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.”\n\nThe tariff threat against Nato allies united the leaders of those nations in unusually blunt language, after months of treading carefully for fear of triggering the volatile US president’s rage.\n\nIn response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a statement that the Europeans “have consistently underlined our shared transatlantic interest in peace and security in the Arctic, including through NATO. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone.”\n\n“The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland,” she added. “Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”\n\n“Our position on Greenland is very clear – it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and the Danes,” the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said. “Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.”\n\nEmmanuel Macron, the French president, drew an implicit comparison between Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” Macron wrote in a social media riposte to Trump.\n\nFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, whose excellence at golf previously made him something of a Trump whisperer, echoed the warning about a potential “downward spiral”.\n\n“We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,” the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, added. That sentiment was echoed by Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, who wrote: “Threats have no place among allies.”\n\nGermany’s leadership was more reserved, with the German chancellor Friedrich Merz leaving it to his spokesperson, Stefan Kornelius, to say only that the government “has taken note of” Trump’s statements and plans to coordinate with allies to “decide on appropriate responses at the appropriate time”.\n\nOn Friday, however, a spokesperson on foreign policy for the chancellor’s Christian Democrat party, Jürgen Hardt, suggested that Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup Trump is hosting this summer “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”. Polling done before Trump’s latest threat for the popular German tabloid Bild revealed broad support for a World Cup boycott, with 47% of Germans in favor and just 35% against, should the US annex Greenland.\n\nEven before the new tariff threat, there were mass protests in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday against Trump’s efforts to “acquire” the island.\n\nHis latest tariff threat comes just eight months after Trump announced that he had struck a trade pact with the UK – and six months after he announced a pact with the European Union.\n\nThe UK would have protection against future US tariffs “because I like them”, Trump declared in the summer. He described the pact with the EU as a “powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n\nTrump’s sudden reversal on Saturday even managed to alienate one of his biggest fans, Nigel Farage, the leader of the rightwing, anti-immigrant party Reform UK. “We don’t always agree with the US government and in this case we certainly don’t. These tariffs will hurt us,” Farage wrote.\n\nThere was also criticism from Trump’s own Republican party. Thom Tillis, a US senator from North Carolina, called the president’s threat “bad for America” but “great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided”.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” Tillis added.\n\nThe president has repeatedly turned to tariffs in a bid to force countries to bend to his will – with some success. Days after returning to office for his second term in early 2025, Colombia agreed to accept military aircraft carrying deported migrants after Trump threatened steep duties on the country’s exports to the US.\n\nTrump, who has previously extolled the benefits of tariffs as a negotiating tool, stressed on Saturday that the US was “immediately open to negotiation” with Denmark and any of the countries it was threatening to hit with these new tariffs.\n\nHis aggressive global trade strategy has raised fears for the US economy, which analysts and policymakers have warned could face significant damage from sweeping tariffs on the world.\n\nWhile the White House has played down such concerns, a vast wave of tariffs unveiled by Trump last spring – when he proclaimed the start of a new era for the US economy – was quickly reversed as global markets fell sharply.\n\nBut his administration’s erratic rollout of other tariffs nevertheless significantly strained US trade ties with the world. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale, the highest level since 1935.\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said recently that Greenland’s defence is a “common concern” for the whole of Nato. The Guardian reported that European troops had deployed to Greenland, in part, to establish what a more sustained ground deployment on the territory could look like, and partly to reassure the US that European Nato members were serious about Arctic security.\n\nFewer than one in five of Americans approve of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, a poll published on Thursday by Reuters/Ipsos found. Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the effort, and only 4% of Americans think the US should take Greenland using military force.\n\nMuch of Trump’s wider trade strategy is currently in the hands of the US supreme court, which is mulling whether the imposition of many of his tariffs was legal. A decision could be announced as early as next week.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — From toppling Venezuela's leader to ordering mass deportations, from turning once independent government entities into rubber stamps to demolishing the East Wing for a White House ballroom, President Donald Trump spent his first year back in office trampling political norms and testing institutional checks and balances.\n\nSome of his ideas that once seemed implausible, if not outright fanciful, are now reality. But there are other things that Trump could not deliver on.\n\n“I’ve kept all my promises and much more,” Trump insisted during a speech this week in Detroit.\n\nWith his administration nearing the one-year mark, here's a look at where some of his most jaw-dropping promises stand:\n\nIn progress: A new Qatari Air Force One\n\nU.S. defense officials in May accepted a luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar for Trump to eventually use as Air Force One, brushing aside ethical and legal questions and even anti-bribery constitutional provisions. The aircraft is being retrofitted in Texas to meet U.S. security and communications standards that are likely to cost about $400 million, the Air Force says. Outside experts estimate costs could approach $1 billion. Despite Trump's boasts that the work would be done in six months, completion may not actually occur until after he leaves office in January 2029.\n\nWhat's in progress: Annexing Greenland\n\nAfter the U.S. military's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump renewed his calls to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory, insisting the United States will “have” Greenland “one way or another.” The president also tapped Gov. Jeff Landry, R-La., as the special U.S. envoy to Greenland, with a nod to the 1803 Louisiana Purchase from France that doubled the size of the U.S. Denmark says it is not ceding the world's largest island and that any invasion could have geopolitical implications given that Denmark is a NATO ally.\n\nTrump has tried to denigrate his predecessor, Joe Biden, by accusing the Democrat of overreliance on the autopen to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents, despite the fact that Trump and other presidents have also used the tool. In October, a GOP-controlled House committee released a report alleging misuse of the autopen by the Biden administration. Trump's Department of Justice is investigating.\n\nThe president has said he wants to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious San Francisco Bay prison that has been closed for six-plus decades, to house immigration detainees. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, toured the island in July. His agency announced that engineers and planners were developing design concepts, preliminary budgets and logistical models.\n\nTrump has posted on social media about extending traditional home mortgages repayments from 30 years to 50 years, suggesting that this could ease concerns about housing affordability. Economists say the switch would make it harder to build wealth through home ownership. Nonetheless, the White House has pledged to push the change. Officials have made little headway since, however, and Trump instead has looked to reduce mortgage rates by having the federal government buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds.\n\nTrump has frequently toyed with the idea of a third term, despite the Constitution stating that no one can be elected president “more than twice.” He acknowledged in October, “I would say that if you read it, it’s pretty clear I’m not allowed to run. It’s too bad.” White House chief of staff Susie Wiles also told Vanity Fair that Trump “knows he can’t run again.” Still, Trump mused this month, “I’m not allowed to run? I’m not sure,” and suggested there could be “a constitutional movement” to make that happen.\n\nWhat's faded away: Making Canada the 51st state\n\nDespite it being far-fetched, Trump has talked about making America's northern neighbor the “Great State of Canada” since before his second term started. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney assured Trump during a subsequent White House visit that his country “won’t be for sale, ever.” Carney suggested in June that Trump had lost interest. Trump has continued to bring up the idea, though, including during a September speech to military personnel in Virginia.\n\nTrump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. The president even floated the notion of tagging along. Nothing came of that, however, and Musk has left the administration.\n\nSending thousands of migrants to Guantanamo\n\nThe president pledged to ship up to 30,000 of the “worst criminal aliens” to a U.S. Navy lockup in Cuba, and between February and June, about 500 immigrants were held there. But those numbers have since declined and sometimes reached zero. Housing migrants at Guantanamo is more expensive than in traditional detention centers, and doing so has drawn legal challenges.\n\nGaza Strip as a Mediterranean Sea resort\n\nTrump repeatedly suggested that the U.S. would take over war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians living there, and that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” after the war between Israel and Hamas. Gaza's reconstruction is a key question amid a Trump administration-brokered ceasefire, but Arab nations have rejected the idea of it being a vacation spot. Trump no longer mentions it.\n\nThe president says his tariffs could raise enough revenue for most Americans to get $2,000 payments. But he also has pledged to spend that same money on plugging deficits created by tax cuts, reducing the national debt, keeping a key nutrition program for low-income mothers and children funded during last year's government shutdown, aiding farmers and adding to defense spending for 2027. The U.S. collected about $289 billion in tariff revenue last year, which would be well short of what rebate checks would cost, even without the other promised earmarks. Trump also promised that slashing the size of federal government would give Americans rebate checks, but those never materialized.\n\nEliminating the federal income tax\n\nTrump has frequently said that steep import tariffs “will be enough to cut all of the income tax,” long suggesting that the U.S. was better off during the Gilded Age, when there was no income tax and federal revenue came largely from tariffs. “If you go back to the 1800s, 1887,” he said Friday, “We had money, so much money, we didn’t know what to do with it.” Lately, however, his administration has more often been promoting how much his tax and spending law might reduce 2026 tax bills for many Americans.\n\nTrump hates the dynamic kickoff, calling it a “demeaning” and “unromantic” affront to football's “pageantry.” By November, Trump was suggesting the NFL didn't “have the right to do that to the game” while acknowledging, “I don’t think they’ll change.”\n\nWhat's been accomplished: Bringing back the War Department\n\nTrump signed an executive order in September aiming to rename the Department of Defense as the Department of War. It will take an act of Congress to make the change lawful.\n\nThe board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, stocked with Trump loyalists, voted in December to add Trump's name to Washington's premier performing arts venue, memorializing the 35th president. The move drew show cancellations and a lawsuit. The Kennedy Center is named by statute and would need Congress' approval for a legal change.\n\nReducing Chinese influence on the Panama Canal\n\nTrump suggested before his second term that the U.S. might retake control of the Panama Canal because Panama had failed to check Chinese influence over the waterway. His administration then pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at both ends of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium, though that process faced delays. Panama withdrew from China's Belt and Road investment program in Latin America, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama in April and agreed to bolster security coordination.\n\nThe president announced in December that his long-promised “ gold card ” was going on sale. It offers legal status, and an eventual pathway to U.S. citizenship, for individuals paying $1 million and corporations ponying up twice that per foreign-born employee, plus an upfront $15,000 fee to cover screening costs. The program is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which offered permanent U.S. residency in exchange for foreign investors spending a bit more than $1 million on a business that creates at least 10 full-time jobs for American workers.\n\nSince tearing down the East Wing, construction crews have worked into the night, hustling to finish the massive ballroom before Trump's term ends. The president initially said the structure, set to be bigger than the White House itself, would cost $200 million but he now says $400 million. He has promised that it will be paid for by himself and private donors. The White House has released only a partial list of who is actually contributing and has argued that parts of the project's plans are “ top secret.”\n\nMore to watch: Possible US military action in Colombia, Mexico and Iran\n\nFollowing the U.S. operation in Venezuela, Trump accused Colombian President Gustavo Petro of “making cocaine and selling it to the United States” and said U.S intervention in that country “sounds good to me.” After a friendly call with Petro, however, Trump suggested that “the situation of drugs and other disagreements” had been defused. Trump, though, also maintains that Mexico is “run” by drug cartels and says, “You have to do something with Mexico.” He's warned Iran that if that country starts “killing people like they have in the past” during a recent round of sweeping, anti-government protests, then “they are going to get hit very hard by the United States.” Killings have run into the thousands, but by Friday, Trump appeared to be backing off those threats.\n\nCuba collapsing with or without US intervention\n\nTrump has repeatedly noted Cuba's weakened position since the U.S. captured Maduro, whose country was a major ally of the communist-run island. Trump has said Cuba “only survives because of Venezuela” and is “ready to fall” without the U.S. intervening. Venezuela's economic and social chaos and Maduro's ouster have raised questions about Cuba's future. But Trump has also suggested Cuba “make a deal, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE,” without saying what that means.\n\nTrump says he wants a Golden Dome missile defense program — a multilayered, $175 billion system that would put U.S. weapons in space for the first time — to be fully operational by January 2029. Defense officials say more likely all that will be achieved by then is some initial capability for the system. It is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities that can detect and stop missiles at various stages of attack.\n\nTrump said he talked to Rob Manfred before Major League Baseball's commissioner reinstated Cincinnati Reds slugger Pete Rose in May. Rose died in 2024 but still faced a baseball ban over betting on the game, despite having a record 4,256 career hits. Trump now wants Rose in the Hall of Fame, but that's up to the Hall’s Classic Baseball Committee, which likely will not meet until at least December 2027.\n\nThe fourth installment of the cop buddy-comedy series starring Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan will be coming out after a reported request from Trump. Paramount, which is co-owned by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump megadonor Larry Ellison, is set to distribute the film. Semafor reported that Trump had asked Ellison to help revive the franchise. Warner Bros. released the first three “Rush Hour” films, but eschewed the fourth after earlier sexual misconduct allegations against its director, Brett Ratner. Ratner also made a documentary on first lady Melania Trump.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has turned to his favorite form of leverage in his effort to annex Greenland: Tariffs.\n\nTrump said on Saturday he would impose on February 1 an additional 10% tariff on Denmark, which controls Greenland, as well as Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland, unless they agree to a deal to hand over Greenland to the United States.\n\nThe president said he would raise those tariffs to 25% in June if they did not comply. All of those countries have already been paying some form of tariff since Trump's Liberation Day levies went into effect in August 2025.\n\n\"This tariff will be due and payable until such time a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase,\" he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nTrump's threat comes as world leaders and CEOs gather in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. The president is expected to address the conference in person on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has had Greenland on his mind since his first term, but has ramped up the rhetoric since the US raid in Venezuela that netted Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe president says US control of Greenland is a national security issue. The Arctic country sits at a strategic point between Russia and China. The US already has a military base, known as the Pituffik Space Base, on the island. Greenland is also a base of critical natural resources, including lithium, gold, iron ore, and oil.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was considering a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's new tariff threat comes as the Supreme Court reviews whether the president has the authority to impose broad, sweeping tariffs on whatever country he wants — and there's a chance it could rule against the president.",

    "description": "The president also ruled out the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, as a possible pick for Fed chair.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "John Higgins stunned world number one Judd Trump as he fought back from 3-0 and 5-3 down to win 6-5 and reach his first Masters final since 2021.\n\nThe Scot will now face Kyren Wilson in Sunday's best-of-19 showpiece match beginning at 13:00 GMT, after he defeated Chinese debutant Wu Yize 6-5 in another thrilling last-four encounter.\n\nHiggins had lost his previous seven matches against Trump and appeared to be toiling as he made a series of errors in the opening three frames.\n\nHowever, Trump, whose highest break until that point was just 60, failed to convert two good opportunities to take the fourth frame which provided Higgins with a route back into the contest.\n\n\"He should maybe have been 4-0 in front and I maybe made it too easy for him,\" Higgins, who won the second of his two Masters titles 20 years ago, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The fourth frame was massive because if he goes 4-0 it's done, but at 3-1 I felt good.\"\n\n\"People will laugh but I think I'm a better player now than I've ever been. You play these great champions like Judd and I am so proud because I've lost the last few against him.\"\n\nWith the momentum shifting, Higgins, 50, also took the fifth with a superb 104 break.\n\nThe Englishman pinched the sixth and eighth frames with half centuries after his opponent missed reds, but Higgins made a 57 clearance in similar fashion to take frame seven.\n\nTrump, 36, who has generally held sway in meetings between the pair since triumphing in their 2019 world final, looked set to seal victory in the ninth frame but with just four balls to pot, remarkably missed a routine brown.\n\nAnd that gave Higgins the impetus to craft pressure-breaks of 70 and 57 on his way to reeling off three tense frames in a row to complete a remarkable turnaround and become the oldest player to reach the final of a Triple Crown event.",

    "description": "Here are the businesses that Trump's first year back in office have greatly benefitted, and industries that have been hit hard.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's year in office was a mixed bag of blessings and woes for the business world.\n\nLast year began with a lineup of billionaires at Trump's inauguration, all of whom soon saw their net worth diminish after Trump enacted sweeping tariffs aimed at reshoring manufacturing jobs.\n\nTheir fortunes soon rebounded, and Trump has been a booster of the tech industry, which continued to grow in 2025.\n\nBusinesses were also often caught in Trump's crosshairs, including Intel, Amazon, and Walmart.\n\nFrom the retail sector to the AI industry, here's how different industries fared in Trump's first year of his second term.\n\nThe AI industry continued to soar during the first year of Trump's second term.\n\nAccording to Morningstar, the company's AI basket of 34 stocks, which includes Amazon, Cisco, and Apple, saw a 50.8% in share value in 2025, while the overall stock market gained 17.3% and the broader tech sector rose 21.4%, based on the Morningstar US Market Index.\n\nWithin the first month of his presidency, Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called Stargate, to be led by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which he said would be \"the largest AI infrastructure project in history.\"\n\nTrump has also been a booster of the tech industry at large — while receiving donations, gifts, pledges for more American manufacturing, and praise from leaders.\n\nHe's had notable visits with CEOs, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. The US eventually allowed Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China, under the condition that the government gets a cut of the profit.\n\nTrump also rescinded an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden that established a federal framework for AI safety and risk mitigation, and he signed a new order intended to override state-level AI regulations.\n\nAnd after publicly calling for the resignation of Intel's CEO, Trump made a deal for the US to take a nearly 10% equity in the company, which has since seen its stock rise.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump's second year in office in his second term will bring.\n\nConcerns are bubbling under the industry boom. Industry experts fear that an AI bubble burst will bring about a market crash similar to the dot-com crash.\n\nTrump is also warning tech companies that data centers cannot contribute to the affordability crisis by driving up energy bills. Some tech bulls, such as Dan Ives, said that the focus on costs could derail the AI boom.\n\nRetail businesses, large and small, have been hit hard by Trump's first year back.\n\nThe Trump presidency kicked off with a flurry of tariffs, sometimes on some of the country's closest trade partners. Businesses in retail have been struggling to keep up with the pace of change, and some have responded by hiking prices.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that the tariffs had disproportionately affected Main Street and entrepreneurs who make physical products. Several small businesses sued Trump over the tariffs enacted using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nEven if businesses were able to handle tariffs, they were competing for skittish consumers after sentiment sank to a new low in November, based on the Consumer Index by the University of Chicago. Economists have also found that while the wealthy have continued to spend, others have cut back.\n\nNot everything was down. Trump did backtrack on some of his tariffs, and the retail sector did see some growth compared to 2024, according to the ‌Commerce Department's Census Bureau.\n\nDespite Trump's promise to bring blue-collar jobs back to the US and some high-profile plans, like Apple's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically and Nvidia's plans for a US-based supercomputer plant, the manufacturing sector has still not taken off.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, factory employment has dropped by more than 70,000 since April, to 12.69 million as of December, the lowest point since March 2022. The Bureau also estimated that the manufacturing sector lost 8,000 jobs in December alone.\n\nIn May 2025, a month after Trump enacted the bulk of his tariffs, Wells Fargo economists predicted that the duties would not be effective in reshoring manufacturing jobs and that the administration would face an \"uphill battle.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that some small and medium-sized businesses have canceled domestic investment plans due to economic uncertainty stemming from the constantly changing tariffs. The loss of manufacturing jobs also reflects a broader trend of a low-hire, low-fire environment, where businesses freeze in the face of an uncertain environment.\n\nTrump has shown a recent interest in policy around the sector.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, arguing it could make monthly payments more affordable for buyers shut out of homeownership.\n\nHe also recently said that he wants to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes in order to increase the supply of homes. He also announced that he would instruct his \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, without further clarification.\n\nHome prices rose in 77% of metro markets during the third quarter of 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors' latest report. Business Insider also previously reported that the median age of a first-time homebuyer hit 40 in 2025, up from 31 a decade earlier.\n\nEconomists have thus far commented that neither idea would address the root of the problem, which is a shortage of homes. Trump's tariffs on raw materials may have also contributed to the cost of constructing homes.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that efforts to crack down on Mexican cartels and slow migration north were showing “compelling results\" in an effort to head off intervention talk by the Trump administration.\n\nThe comments come after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened that U.S. forces “will now start hitting land” in Mexico targeting drug cartels, after the dramatic United States military raid on Venezuela that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nSheinbaum, a leftist who boasts of taking on chaos with a “cool head,” has sought to placate Trump and, unlike Maduro, has worked to build out a strong relationship between the Mexican and U.S. governments. The early January raid in Venezuela set much of Latin America on edge, fueling concern that Trump could soon turn American forces on other nations, particularly Cuba and Mexico.\n\nOn Thursday night, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Mexican Foreign Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente released a joint statement after a phone call, saying they agreed “more must be done to confront shared threats.”\n\nSheinbaum, mentioning the call on Friday in her morning press briefing, said that Mexico's government had made significant progress cracking down on cartels, citing a steep drop in the homicide rate, much lower fentanyl seizures by U.S. authorities at the border and sparse migration. She noted it was a joint effort with the U.S.\n\n“There are very compelling results from the joint cooperation and the work that Mexico has been doing,” she said.\n\nShe reiterated her call for the United States to stop arms trafficking into Mexico and highlighted drug use in the U.S. as a key factor fueling cartel violence in Mexico.\n\n“The other side also has to do its part. This consumption crisis they have over there also has to be addressed from a public health perspective, through education campaigns,” she said.\n\nSheinbaum and Trump also spoke by phone Monday. Sheinbaum said she again told Trump that U.S. intervention in Mexico was unnecessary.",

    "description": "Worried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.",
    "fullText": "A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, \n\nWorried about losing unified Republican power in Washington and mystified at his lack of support among the public, President Donald Trump keeps talking about not holding the November midterm elections, when Republicans could lose control of the House, Senate or both.\n\nTrump doesn’t understand why his approval rating is underwater (and it is, on every issue, in a CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released Friday).\n\n“I wish you could explain to me what the hell’s going on with the mind of the public,” he told House Republicans in a speech earlier this month.\n\nLater, he added: “Now, I won’t say, ‘Cancel the election. They should cancel the election,’ because the fake news will say, ‘He wants the elections canceled. He’s a dictator.’”\n\nBut Trump did talk about canceling the election in an interview with Reuters this week. He said Republicans have been so successful that “when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said the president was “joking” and “being facetious” about canceling the election.\n\nIf it’s a joke, it’s material he’s been working on for months. Told during an appearance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last September that Ukraine won’t hold an election during a period of martial law during its war with Russia, Trump expressed some envy.\n\n“So you say during the war, you can’t have elections,” Trump said. “So let me just say, three and a half years from now – so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that’s good.”\n\nTrump routinely says things that seem like trolls until they don’t. Owning Greenland? Not a joke. However, he seems to have retreated from the oft-repeated idea of an unconstitutional third term.\n\nAnd for the record, unlike Ukraine, the US has held elections in the midst of multiple wars, when the British had invaded in 1812 and when it was at war with itself in 1864. It held elections during world wars when millions of Americans fought overseas in the 20th century as well.\n\nTrump knows that presidents rarely pick up seats in a midterm. His administration has been moving at breakneck speed to change the government because, as his chief of staff famously said, they know that presidents expect to lose power after their first two years. A net loss of just a handful of seats would give control of the House to Democrats, for instance, requiring their buy-in for spending and giving them power to investigate his administration.\n\nThe Constitution requires that a new Congress be sworn in on January 3, 2027. Election Day is set in law, so it is theoretically feasible for Congress to move it, but not to cancel the election. Elections are supposed to be administered by each state, so state governors and legislatures could, in theory, move their own elections to deal with a major disaster, but there’s no precedent for it. To get into the weeds of all of this, read a report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nTrump has also mused about using emergency powers to meddle with elections. He told the New York Times recently that he regrets not directing National Guards to seize voting machines after the 2020 election.\n\nEven the elections he has won, he has said were rigged. There’s still no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, even after all these years of the Trump era.\n\nElection officials say they are thinking very carefully about all of this. Asked about Trump’s musings at an event sponsored by The Atlantic this week, Arizona’s top election official, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, said this:\n\n“The fact that we’re running through these scenarios in the first place should tell you something about the health of our democracy,” Fontes added.\n\nTo that end, he would not elaborate on what scenarios they’re preparing for.\n\n“I don’t want to give the bad guys any ideas,” Fontes said.\n\nWhile Trump might fantasize about canceling the election, the reality is that the election system is already changing in some key ways. Some of them may be enormously consequential.\n\nRepublicans have drawn themselves nine more friendly seats across the country, and Democrats have ended up with six, mostly in California. Republicans see additional opportunity in Florida, while Democrats plan a redistricting ballot initiative in Virginia in April. Read more.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decides to further gut the Voting Rights Act, Republicans could in theory redraw maps in many other states. Read takeaways from October’s oral arguments.\n\nThe long-term result of more and more political gerrymandering without protections for racial minority-focused districts could be the smothering of minority-party delegations in multiple states, making the House map look increasingly more like the presidential map. Far fewer Democratic districts in Texas. Far fewer Republican districts in California — even though there are millions of both Republicans and Democrats in both states.\n\nWhile much of the effort has been stopped, for now, by courts, Trump’s goal is to exert more executive control over elections that are supposed to be governed by Congress and states.\n\nA federal court on Thursday sided with California against the administration’s demand that the state turn over information on its 23 million voters.\n\nThe Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether mail-in ballots that are postmarked by, but arrive after Election Day can still be counted. The decision could have serious consequences for the country’s large scale adoption of mail-in voting in recent years. Trump is a loud skeptic of the practice even though he has personally voted by mail. His executive order would also scramble how states use voting machines, another response to phantom voter fraud that could actually drastically slow down the counting of ballots.\n\nEarly on, his administration scaled back the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, which is meant to helps states guard their election systems from attack. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem canceled funding for an information sharing network that helped states detect and ward off coordinated hacking attacks, as CNN reported last year.\n\nHis Justice Department has rewired the agency’s Civil Rights Division away from its original core mission of civil rights abuses, including those related to elections. One current focus of the division is to help states “clean” voter rolls, although a judge recently ruled that effort was a misapplication of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nTrump’s administration has already tried to change how people vote through executive action, and who they vote for through changing maps.\n\nThere’s a lot of time for more gaming the system between now and November, and Trump clearly already has the midterms on the brain.",

    "fullText": "ESPN host Stephen A. Smith has issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party ahead of this year’s pivotal midterm elections.\n\nThe longtime NBA commentator, who has hinted at a move into politics, unloaded on Trump over how he has handled the presidency so far in his second term, predicting sweeping losses for Republicans if current trends continue.\n\n“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there, you’re about to lose the midterms. You’re going to lose. And you might lose the presidency in 2028, and it’s going to be at the fault of your president, Donald Trump,” the host said in an episode of Straight Shooter with Stephen A. that aired on Thursday.\n\nSmith is among a growing list of prominent voices warning of trouble for Trump as the midterms approach. The GOP holds narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate, leaving little margin for error.\n\nHis voice rising to nearly a shout, the ESPN pundit said Trump is “going to blow it” for the GOP.\n\n“Trump is blowing it! He’s blowing it! He’s going to blow it for himself; he’s going to blow it for the GOP; he’s going to blow it for Congress; he’s going to blow it for the Senate; and he’s likely going to blow it for the White House,” said Smith.\n\n“The man don’t know how to act,” he went on, criticizing the political climate and messaging coming from the White House.\n\n“What you’re hearing about is Gestapo tactics on the part of ICE. What you’re hearing about is, what happened to going after the hardcore criminals and making sure to deport them, as opposed to terrorizing everyday, normal American citizens?”\n\n“What we’re hearing about is chaos, chaos, chaos. And, oh my lord, we don’t need to see this again. We don’t need to see this again. That’s what you’re hearing about. And you’re hearing a president that doesn’t know how to be quiet,” Smith said.\n\nThe ESPN host stopped short of calling Trump self-obsessed, saying he’s like “somebody addicted to carrying a microphone.”\n\n“I, your friendly neighborhood host, is on the air between ESPN and Sirius XM. I am on the air live a minimum of 22 hours a week, a minimum of 45 weeks a year—a year! Ladies and gentlemen, that equates to over 900 hours, and I’ve got nothing on Trump. Not a damn thing! He can’t stop! Every time you turn around, it’s something.”\n\nSmith also pointed to cracks among Trump’s allies.\n\nHe added: “It’s so bad right now. Even the godfather of podcasting, Joe Rogan, who endorsed Donald Trump right before the 2024 election has spoken out about him.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff James Blair has also acknowledged that the GOP faces trouble ahead, while Rep. Nancy Mace has said she’s not confident Republicans will be able to retain control of the House of Representatives in the midterms.\n\nTrump has begged Republicans to win the 2026 congressional midterm elections to stop Democrats from attempting to impeach him.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump this week quietly appointed four new members to the Commission of Fine Arts, one of two federal panels reviewing his plan to build a White House ballroom.\n\nThe Republican president has talked about building a White House ballroom for years, and completing the proposed 90,000-square-foot (8,400-square-meter) addition would not only forever alter the public face of the mansion but would stand for decades as a lasting legacy to Trump.\n\nOne of new members is James McCrery, an architect who had led the now $400 million ballroom project until Trump replaced him late last year. The White House has said the project would be financed with private donations — including from Trump himself — and the East Wing has already been demolished to make space for the ballroom.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued in federal court to halt construction until the fine arts panel and a second federal commission give their approval. The four new members were revealed in court papers filed Thursday by a White House official as part of that lawsuit. The White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\nThe new appointments would give the Commission of Fine Arts a quorum, or enough members to conduct business at a meeting scheduled for Jan. 22, where consideration of what is being called the East Wing Modernization project is on the agenda. The panel had been scheduled to meet this past week, but could not due to the lack of new members.\n\nThe commission did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe panel normally has seven members but has been unable to meet for months. Trump dismissed six commissioners last fall after the East Wing was torn down. A seventh commissioner, who was the panel’s chair, had earlier resigned after Trump took office last year because their term had expired.\n\nThe White House is tentatively scheduled to formally present the project to the commission on Feb. 19 and March 19, at which time the panel could complete its review, Heather Martin, a deputy assistant to the president, said in the court papers.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation has accused the Trump administration of violating federal laws by starting the project before submitting it for independent reviews by the commissions and Congress, as well as the public.\n\nAside from architect McCrery, who had served on the commission as a Trump appointee from 2019-2024, the commission will include Mary Anne Carter of Tennessee; Roger Kimball of Connecticut; and Matthew Taylor of Washington, D.C.\n\nCarter is chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, a position she also held during Trump’s first term. She is a former staffer to Rick Scott, a former governor of Florida and current U.S. senator from the state. Kimball is an art critic and conservative commentator.\n\nThe National Capital Planning Commission, the second federal panel with oversight of construction on federal land, including the White House grounds, heard an initial presentation about the ballroom at its meeting on Jan. 8.",

    "description": "The president issued a raft of clemency grants this week, including pardoning a woman he had given relief to once before and a man whose daughter had donated millions to a Trump super PAC.",
    "fullText": "In 2021, a convicted fraudster named Adriana Camberos was freed from prison when President Trump commuted her sentence.\n\nRather than taking advantage of that second chance, prosecutors said, Ms. Camberos returned to crime. She and her brother were convicted in 2024 in an unrelated fraud.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump pardoned both siblings, marking the second time he had opened the prison gates for Ms. Camberos.\n\nTheir pardons were among a handful of clemency grants quietly issued by Mr. Trump on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAmong the other lucky recipients: a man whose daughter had given millions to a Trump-backed super PAC, a former governor of Puerto Rico and a former F.B.I. agent — all of whom had pleaded guilty in a political corruption case.\n\nThe pardons, most of which have not been previously reported, were supported by people with close ties to Mr. Trump’s orbit, including lawyers who had worked for him.\n\nThey continue a trend in which Mr. Trump has used the unfettered presidential clemency power to reward allies and those who have paid his associates or donated to his political operation. The approach stands in contrast to Justice Department guidelines that prioritize the clemency applications of people who have completed their prison sentences or demonstrated remorse and a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe pardons, several of which forgave white-collar crimes and frauds by affluent perpetrators, strike a discordant note with the Trump administration’s announcement that it was suspending federal funding for programs intended to serve poor people in Minnesota in order to root out fraud.\n\nA White House official justified the clemency grants in a statement as rectifying excessive sentences or prosecutions that were politically motivated to target Trump supporters. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the clemency grants on the record, suggested that Mr. Trump made the clemency decisions based on the merits, not whether the recipients had political connections or had made donations to groups he supports.\n\nThree of the recipients were scheduled to be sentenced this month in a political corruption case related to accusations that former Gov. Wanda Vázquez of Puerto Rico had accepted bribes from Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian banker, in 2020.\n\nIn late 2024, while Mr. Herrera was facing felony bribery and other charges in the case, his daughter, Isabela Herrera, donated $2.5 million to MAGA Inc., a super PAC devoted to Mr. Trump and run by his allies.\n\nIn May, her father’s lawyer, Christopher M. Kise, who had served on Mr. Trump’s legal defense team, negotiated an unusually lenient deal with the Justice Department. Under the deal, which was authorized by a top Trump appointee, Mr. Herrera agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor campaign finance charge, disappointing career prosecutors who had pushed for a harsher sentence.\n\nIn July, Ms. Herrera donated another $1 million to MAGA Inc. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump this week pardoned Mr. Herrera, Ms. Vázquez and Mark Rossini, a former F.B.I. agent who had worked as a consultant for Mr. Herrera. All three had pleaded guilty in August to misdemeanor campaign finance charges.\n\nThe White House official denied that Ms. Herrera’s donations had played any role in her father’s pardon. Instead, the official suggested that pardon and the others related to the Puerto Rico case were motivated by a belief that the investigation into the matter was retribution for Ms. Vázquez’s endorsement of Mr. Trump in 2020.\n\nMr. Herrera “is profoundly grateful” to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kise said in a statement.\n\nLawyers for Ms. Vázquez and Mr. Rossini did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs for Ms. Camberos, she was among a number of people granted clemency by Mr. Trump who have been charged with new crimes after receiving a second chance.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nMs. Camberos began serving a 26-month prison sentence in December 2019 for her role in a scheme to sell millions of counterfeit bottles of the caffeinated drink 5-Hour Energy. Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in the final days of his first term after she enlisted two lawyers with connections in his orbit. One of them, Stefan C. Passantino, had been a deputy White House counsel in the first Trump administration. Another, Adam Katz, represented Rudolph W. Giuliani in a defamation case related to his effort to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election.\n\nBut soon after her release from prison, she and her brother Andres embarked on a new fraud, federal prosecutors in California said. The siblings were charged in 2023 in a complicated scheme: They bought consumer goods from manufacturers at a steep discount, purportedly to sell them in Mexico — a legal practice. Instead, prosecutors said, the siblings sold the goods in the United States at higher prices and then committed bank and mail fraud to cover their tracks.\n\nThey were convicted in 2024. In April, Ms. Camberos was sentenced to more than one year in prison — 12 months for the new conviction and additional months for violating her probation on her earlier conviction — and Andres Camberos was given one year of home confinement. Ms. Camberos had begun serving her sentence.\n\nThey were ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution to the companies they defrauded.\n\nThe White House official did not respond to a question about whether the pardon would wipe away the Camberos siblings’ restitution payments, but pardons typically erase financial penalties.\n\nThe siblings’ supporters had argued privately that they were targeted by prosecutors because Mr. Trump had wiped away Ms. Camberos’s sentence from her earlier conviction — a claim echoed by the White House official.\n\nMr. Passantino and Mr. Katz had worked to secure pardons for the siblings, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nThe two lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Marcus Bourassa, another lawyer for Ms. Camberos, said in a statement that his client was wrongfully convicted and is grateful to the President and others for their support.\n\nMr. Katz also had supported clemency for Terren S. Peizer, a former business executive who had been convicted in 2024 of insider trading and sentenced last year to 42 months in prison. Mr. Peizer was also ordered to pay a fine of $5.25 million and forfeit more than $12.7 million. He was pardoned on Friday by Mr. Trump.\n\nDavid Willingham, a lawyer for Mr. Peizer, said in a statement that the case was a “massive overreach” by the government.\n\nAnother statement issued on behalf of Mr. Peizer himself said that “there aren’t enough words to express the gratitude and appreciation I have for the compassion and recognition of this unfair process by the most accomplished president of my lifetime, and perhaps beyond.”\n\nThe White House official said that Mr. Peizer’s case was an example of excessive prosecution and that he had properly disclosed the trades.\n\nAnother finance executive who received a pardon, David Levy, was convicted by a jury in 2019 for his role in a scheme to defraud bondholders while he was the co-chief investment officer of a New York hedge fund. In a statement issued after the conviction, a federal official who oversaw part of the investigation called the verdict “a warning for all the fraudsters out there: No matter how slick you think you are, liars, frauds and cheats never win.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump also signed eight commutations, which cut short sentences but do not necessarily wipe away other penalties related to convictions.\n\nMost went to people convicted of drug offenses, including James P. Womack, the son of Representative Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who is a Trump ally.\n\nThe younger Mr. Womack had pleaded guilty in 2023 to distributing methamphetamine, and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nHis father, who in November cited a family member’s serious medical issue, thanked Mr. Trump in a statement on Friday “for this gracious and thoughtful action.” The commutation, Mr. Womack said, “has allowed my son to be with his family during a profoundly difficult time.”\n\nAnother commutation went to Jacob Deutsch, who had been sentenced to 62 months in prison in 2024 for his role in a mortgage fraud scheme.\n\nHis clemency grant was supported by the Tzedek Association, a Jewish group that was influential in shaping Mr. Trump’s clemency grants and criminal justice policies during his first term.\n\nThe group, which posted an apparent copy of the signed commutation on social media, contended that the sentence was too harsh and thanked Mr. Trump for affirming mercy “as a cornerstone of American justice.”",

    "description": "Trump and a group of northeastern governors are pressuring a major power grid operator to hold a new auction.",
    "fullText": "The AI data center boom is driving up electricity prices. President Donald Trump is leaning on a power company to fix it.\n\nTrump and a group of governors from northeastern states are calling on PJM Interconnection, the nation's largest power grid operator, to hold a new power auction.\n\nThe goal is to allow major tech companies to foot the bill for new power plants. According to a release from the Department of Interior, a \"coalition of leading technology companies\" has committed to funding new generation capacity, though no companies are named.\n\n\"Make no mistake, if PJM, this faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change, and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act, and forced to go at it alone,\" Gov. Josh Shapiro said at an event for the announcement, according to Politico.\n\nThe Trump administration and the governors are also urging PJM to make a series of other changes, according to a Department of Energy fact sheet. Those changes include:\n\nPJM operates in 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest. Representatives for the company were not present at the Friday event.\n\n\"We don't have a lot to say on this,\" PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg on Thursday. \"We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Shields did not immediately commit to the White House's directives.\n\n\"PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. The PJM Board's decision, resulting from a multi-month stakeholder process on integrating large load additions, will be released later today,\" Shields said. \"The Board has been deliberating on this issue since the end of that stakeholder process. We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board's decision.\"\n\nAri Peskoe, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, told Business Insider that it's unclear whether the administration's approach will work.\n\n\"The intent here is correct, which is to appreciate that data centers are driving up prices in PJM, and an attempt to remedy that for consumers,\" Peskoe said. \"It is meant to isolate data centers from the rest of the market, and, in theory, that seems like a workable approach; but these markets are really complicated, and it's hard to predict how this all shakes out.\"\n\nTrump has been making a broader push for tech companies to pay for the electricity consumed by new data centers in a bid to lower energy costs for consumers.\n\n\"My Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that tech companies must \"pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft on Tuesday released a plan that includes asking utility companies to set higher rates for the company in order to keep costs down for consumers. Other major tech companies could follow a similar path.",

    "fullText": "A reporter confronted President Donald Trump Friday afternoon over his acceptance of a gift award that he did not win, asking “Why would you want somebody else’s Nobel Prize?”\n\nTrump has been foreshadowing that he would be honored to accept the Nobel Peace Prize from 2025 recipient María Corina Machado. After reporting that suggested her failure to refuse the prize contributed to Trump’s decision not to support her, Machado told Sean Hannity she’d love to give her award to the president.\n\nMachado and Trump closed the deal on Thursday at the White House, although the honor that goes with the award is non-transferable.\n\nThe president took questions from reporters on the North Lawn of the White House as he made his way to Marine One on his way to Mar-a-Lago, and was asked about his used award:\n\nREPORTER: Yesterday, yesterday you accepted Maria Machado’s Nobel Prize medal. What do you intend to do with it? And why would you want someone else’s Nobel Prize?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, she offered it to me. I thought it was very nice. She said, you know, you’ve had eight wars and nobody deserves this prize more than in history than you do. And I thought that was a very nice gesture. And by the way, I think she’s a very fine woman and we’ll be talking again.\n\nREPORTER: You just called Machado a very nice person. He said the meeting went well. Why align with Delci Rodriguez and the remnants of the Maduro regime and not with Machado who has the support of the Venezuelan people?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired, every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired, and they ended up being ISIS. Instead of just getting down to business, they ended being ISIS, so I remember that.\n\nBut I’ll tell you, I had a great meeting yesterday by a person who I have a lot of respect for.\n\nAnd she has respect, obviously, for me and our country. And she gave me her Nobel Prize.\n\nBut I’ll tell you what, I got to know her. I never met her before. And I was very, very impressed. She’s a really, this is a fine woman.\n\nThe post Trump Confronted to His Face Over Nobel Yoink: ‘Why Would You Want Somebody Else’s Nobel Prize?’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Anthony Scaramucci thinks Trump’s ‘hard-left’ move to cap credit-card fees is because he’s ‘texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani’",
    "description": "The \"mooch\" says it really shows a pivot to \"full nihilism.\" His podcast guest, longtime GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, called it \"darkly hysterical.\"",
    "fullText": "In a provocative assessment of the current political landscape, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci claims President Donald Trump has entered a “full nihilism mode,” evidenced by a recent proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10%. Speaking on his podcast, The Rest Is Politics US, Scaramucci characterized the move as a “hard-left populist” maneuver that aligns more closely with democratic socialists than traditional Republican orthodoxy.\n\nScaramucci suggested the policy shift is so radical it feels as though Trump is “texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani,” referencing recent reporting in Axios that Trump and the recently elected democratic socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, have been texting since they met at the White House in November.\n\n“This is a hard-left populist thing to do,” he said, though he was quick to point out Trump lacks the unilateral authority to implement such a change. He explained such a cap would require congressional approval and would have to navigate the complex regulatory hurdles of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nSince 2022, interest rates on credit cards has skyroketed, hitting a record high in August 2024. There are a number of reasons why; the Federal Reserve’s campaign to hike interest rates to combat inflation after the pandemic increased the Federal Funds Rate, which is tied to most credit cards’ rates. But Trump and other critics more have blamed credit card companies’ own greed as they extracted more money on top of the rate set by the Federal Funds.\n\nIn 2024, the gap between the typical credit card interest rates and the rates that companies were issuing had the widest gap in history. That allowed large credit card issuers to generate returns on assets six times higher or more than their other banking activities.\n\nMeanwhile, evidence is piling up American consumers are under growing financial strain. Last April, a record number of Americans, 11%, met only the minimum requirement payment on their credit card bill. Consumer debt broadly surged in 2025, with the first three months of the year marking the highest level of debt delinquency since the pandemic.\n\nThis has put Trump in company with more Mamdani-like figures, namely Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But the cap is popular among politicians across the aisle. Senators Sanders and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill last year that would cap credit card interest rates at 10% for five years. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Trump had called her about the proposal this week. \n\nBut it is a nightmare for banks, which have been hammering away on the media cycle arguing the cap would actually cause stricter credit, meaning less people will get access to credit cards.\n\n“An artificial cap on credit card interest rates is likely to backfire on the White House by making credit less accessible to the cash-strapped households that most need it,” Columbia Business School economics professor Brett House told Fortune.\n\nTrump, however, has shown little hesitation in embracing populist policies that unsettle the business community. His second term has been marked by unusually direct executive intervention in markets, often to the discomfort of corporate America.\n\nJoining Scaramucci was veteran Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, former campaign advisor to Mitt Romney, who argued the proposal is a symptom of a larger identity crisis within the GOP. Stevens asserted there is essentially “no conservative party in America today,” noting the party has traded ideological philosophy for a series of “marketing slogans.”\n\nTo Stevens, it was “darkly hysterical” the Republican Party opposes Mamdani’s ascension so much while Trump’s own policies look more classically socialist, first in taking a direct stake in semiconductor champion Intel and now in proposing a cap on interest rates.\n\n“Your socialism is not as good as our socialism,” Stevens said, highlighting what he views as a hypocritical shift toward big-government interventionism.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.\n\nTrump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.”\n\nDuring an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\n\n“I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said.\n\nHe had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.\n\nEarlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThat encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.\n\nEuropean leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.\n\nA relationship that ‘we need to nurture’\n\nIn Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\n\nDelegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group’s hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that’s what you’re hearing with this delegation.”\n\nThe tone contrasted with that emanating from the White House. Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The White House hasn’t ruled out taking the territory by force.\n\n“We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday’s meetings. “And mostly, I would say the threats that we’re seeing right now is from the U.S. side.”\n\nMurkowski emphasized the role of Congress in spending and in conveying messages from constituents.\n\n“I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said.\n\nAlong with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally’s consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council.\n\nInuit council criticizes White House statements\n\nThe dispute is looming large in the lives of Greenlanders. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.””\n\nThe chair of the Nuuk, Greenland-based Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents around 180,000 Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia’s Chukotka region on international issues, said persistent statements from the White House that the U.S. must own Greenland offer “a clear picture of how the US administration views the people of Greenland, how the U.S. administration views Indigenous peoples, and peoples that are few in numbers.”\n\nSara Olsvig told The Associated Press in Nuuk that the issue is “how one of the biggest powers in the world views other peoples that are less powerful than them. And that really is concerning.”\n\nIndigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.\n\nSuperville reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York.

    "description": "The Venezuelan opposition leader’s efforts to share her award with the U.S. president have shaken some Norwegians’ faith in their signature soft-power tool.",
    "fullText": "María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, presented her prize to President Trump on Thursday during a meeting in the White House.\n\nMr. Trump took to social media several hours later to thank her.\n\n“María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done,” he wrote. “Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!”\n\nThe White House shared on social media an image of Mr. Trump holding the frame containing the Nobel medal. The inscription reads that his “Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela” has been recognized. The Nobel Committee has said the Peace Prize is not transferable.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Machado, speaking to reporters earlier after meeting with Mr. Trump, said she had made the presentation “as a recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom.”\n\nThe highly unusual gesture came after months of clamoring by the American president that he had deserved the prize that she was awarded for seeking to usher a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela.\n\nMs. Machado had repeatedly dedicated the prize to Mr. Trump and praised the U.S. military operation nearly two weeks ago that ousted Venezuela’s longtime authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mr. Trump has made clear that he thought he had deserved the prize, saying he had ended several wars and castigating Norway for overlooking him.\n\nBeyond cheering U.S. intervention in her country, Ms. Machado has remained mum about a bombing campaign against boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs. The American strikes have killed more than 100 people.\n\nIt is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump. After ousting Mr. Maduro, he declined to install her in power, saying that “she’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect” needed to lead the country.\n\nIndependently verified vote counts in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election showed that Ms. Machado’s party had beaten Mr. Maduro by a wide margin. The Venezuelan authorities, nonetheless, declared Mr. Maduro the victor, and his government embarked on a harsh repression campaign against critics of the outcome.\n\nSpeaking to supporters and reporters in Washington on Thursday, Ms. Machado said she was “impressed” by how clear Mr. Trump was on her country’s situation and “how much he cares.”\n\nHer efforts to cozy up to Mr. Trump have been met with scorn across the Atlantic Ocean in Norway, where the prize is regarded not just as prestigious and freighted with symbolism, but also as the country’s primary soft-power tool — and where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. The Nobel Institute, which awards it, has been in serious damage-control mode.\n\nLast Friday, after Ms. Machado floated the idea of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview, the institute offered a reminder about what the rules governing the award allow, saying that the facts were “clear and well established.”\n\n“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the institute wrote. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”\n\nThe day before Ms. Machado arrived in Washington, Kristian Harpviken, the director of the institute, who is also the secretary of the committee that chooses award recipients, said he would not be drawn further into the deepening controversy.\n\n“The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate’s contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken,” he said.\n\nThat explanation has been insufficient for many Norwegians.\n\n“A Nobel committee can never guard against peace prize laureates committing acts that run counter to the intention of the prize,’’ Lena Lindgren, a columnist for the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet, said in an interview. “But what is new now is that the prize is being used in a political game, a warlike game.”\n\nMs. Machado’s trip to Washington also drew derision from those now in power in Venezuela. Speaking in Caracas on Thursday, Venezuela’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, who gained the Trump administration’s support in taking over after Mr. Maduro’s ouster, took aim at Ms. Machado in a thinly veiled reference.\n\n“And if one day, as acting president, I have to go to Washington, I will do so with my head held high, not on my knees,” she said.\n\nIt is far from the first time the Nobel committee has been criticized for its choice, or been accused of abetting violent leaders or governments.\n\nGlobal outrage followed the choice of President Barack Obama, who at the time was presiding over military engagements on several continents.\n\nAnd less than a year after receiving the award, Abiy Ahmed, the president of Ethiopia, embarked on a scorched-earth campaign in his country’s Tigray region that left hundreds of thousands dead, wounded and starving. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the prize before a cease-fire to end the Vietnam War broke down, with Mr. Kissinger ultimately trying to return the prize amid a wave of protests. His North Vietnamese counterpart rejected it outright.\n\nWhat makes the dispute swirling around Ms. Machado unusual, according to Asle Sveen, a former researcher at the Nobel Institute, is Norwegians’ particularly dim view of Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Machado “has dedicated her Peace Prize to a highly controversial president, to put it mildly,” Mr. Sveen said. “It is nearly universally accepted in Norway that Donald Trump attacks liberal democracy.”\n\nA Norwegian tabloid, Nettavisen, conducted a poll before the announcement of the award that found three-quarters of respondents were against it being bestowed on Mr. Trump, even if he were instrumental in orchestrating a peace agreement in Ukraine or Gaza.\n\n“The Nobel Committee has compromised the prize” by not foreseeing how Ms. Machado and Mr. Trump would use it to justify military intervention in Venezuela, Ms. Lindgren said. “Norway has been politically embarrassed and has failed to manage the symbolic capital.”\n\nFollowing the 2024 election in Venezuela, Ms. Machado went into hiding for more than a year. In December, she secretly left Venezuela to receive her award in Norway. She missed the award ceremony but appeared in Oslo to greet supporters. Her escape was orchestrated by a company run by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence training.\n\nAmerican lawmakers, including Marco Rubio, who was then a Republican senator from Florida and is now Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, had written a letter to the Nobel Committee in 2024 advocating that they award Ms. Machado the peace prize.\n\nThey noted her “peaceful resistance to tyrants” and her “unwavering moral compass,” and said that her efforts showed the “urgent need for international solidarity in the face of aggressive and expansive authoritarianism.”\n\nThere is little doubt that Ms. Machado has long risked her safety to challenge an authoritarian government that jails opponents, tortures critics and censors the press. But she has also embraced Mr. Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, repeated debunked claims that Mr. Maduro manipulated U.S. elections, and parroted the Trump administration’s claim that Mr. Maduro simultaneously led two drug organizations, despite scant evidence.\n\nHer assertions fueled accusations that she was amplifying misinformation in what, until now, seemed a failed attempt to gain the American president’s support.\n\nStill, not all Norwegians agree that the award to Ms. Machado was a mistake.\n\nIf it turned out that she supported the U.S. boat strikes, that would not be the best reflection on a laureate, said Marianne Dahl, research director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo. But Ms. Machado was awarded for her pro-democracy work in 2024, Ms. Dahl said. She drew similarities between Ms. Machado and past winners who led popular movements in Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Soviet republics, as well as during the so-called Arab Spring.\n\n“It is easy to sit in comfortable Norway and criticize her for talking sweet to Trump,” Ms. Dahl said.\n\nThat, she noted, is exactly what many European and even Norwegian leaders have done. “And they don’t have a repressive regime pursuing them, as Machado has had,” she said.\n\nJack Nicas and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.",

    "fullText": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was accused of “gaslighting” Americans and engaging in “hypocrisy” after she voiced outrage over images of Minneapolis protesters giving their middle fingers to cameras.\n\nTrump administration critics noted that Leavitt’s statement, during her daily news briefing Thursday, came a day after the White House downplayed the president flipping off a Ford plant employee.\n\nLeavitt accused liberal “people in power” of encouraging the protesters in Minneapolis, whom she referred to as “left-wing agitators.”\n\n“If you look at some of the images out of Minneapolis last night. Look at this vehicle, look at what it says: It says ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger -- proudly so -- at the camera,” Leavitt said.\n\n“People don’t do this without encouragement from people in power who make it feel like it’s O.K.,” the press secretary continued.\n\nTrump critics raised their eyebrows over Leavitt’s remarks, sharing photos of the president giving the middle finger.\n\n“Who wants to tell her?” said liberal influencer Joanne Carducci, who tweets under the name JoJoFromJerz.\n\n“This is so rich given her boss did the exact same thing this week. Oh wait, but that was ‘an appropriate response,’ coming from the President,” tweeted another X user. “The hypocrisy and gaslighting with these people is so off the charts that I think they’re starting to truly believe their own lies.”\n\nOf Leavitt, another user said, “Is she this braindead?”\n\nThe White House press secretary addressed the media hours after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the protests.\n\n“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump stated in a post on his Truth Social profile.\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807, which authorizes the president to deploy the U.S. military in America in response to domestic unrest, was last used by then-President George H.W. Bush, who got the support to use the act by local officials.",

    "title": "Suspended Ford Worker Who Was Flipped Off By Trump Made So Much Money On GoFundMe He Paused Donations",
    "description": "Two six-figure crowdfunding campaigns saw thousands of individual donations for the Ford factory worker.",
    "fullText": "President Trump giving the middle-finger to a Ford employee who apparently calls it like he sees it seems to be the best thing that has ever happened to him — financially at least. TJ Sabula, a 40-year old United Auto Workers Local 600 line worker, was quickly suspended with pay by Ford after heckling the President while he was visiting one of its factories in Michigan (the President, in turn, flipped him the bird and apparently mouthed \"F**k you.\") But, soon after, a pair of GoFundMe pages were set up for Sabula and they took off like wildfire.\n\nAs of mid-morning on January 15, the pair of campaigns for Sabula have raised $811,010 from nearly 35,000 separate donations. Sabula, seeming to be a stand-up guy, actually decided to stop accepting donations, indicating he and his family had more than enough.\n\nIn an update on one of the pages, Sabula wrote, \"We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support. We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\" The other page had a similar message and said it was also closing donations. I'm not sure I'm big enough to ever stop taking free money, but good for him.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't just pick a random guy out of the crowd to cuss out, though it wouldn't be that surprising. Sabula reportedly called Trump a \"pedophile protector\" during his visit to the Michigan F-150 factory. The Department of Justice faces criticisms as to the speed it has released the Epstein files–along with the redactions being made to the documents–which must be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nIn any case, as we previously reported, Trump's White House didn't try to cover up or downplay what the President did, instead telling the Washington Post that \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n\nSabula told The Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever,\" though he did add that he feels concerned about the future of his job and believes he has been \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what Sabula's future with Ford will be, but at the very least the $800,000+ he's gotten from GoFundMe will help lighten the blow. On top of that, he's got the backing of the UAW. The union posted this on its website:\n\nThe autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union —the UAW. He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\n\nThe UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member. Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone—including the President of the United States.\n\nThat's certainly the type of union representation we all deserve.\n\nSabula has also received support from U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, who represents Detroit, calling him a \"national hero,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and fellow Michigander Pete Buttigieg has also voiced his support.\n\nNot everyone was on board, though, including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, who earlier in the visit said meeting the president was \"the experience of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Discipline is in the hands of the organization. It's unfortunate and 99% of the employees in the plant were great and I was embarrassed because we're the host. But that was six seconds out of an hour tour and the tour went great.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns can often get people all riled up about someone being rewarded for \"bad behavior\": In early 2025, a woman in Minnesota was caught calling a child a racist slur on a playground and then made over $800,000 on GoFundMe-alike site GiveSendGo, according to NBC News. That woman was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct by the City of Rochester, with a trial set to begin in August 2026, ABC 6 News reports.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "Greenland Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt teared up as she discussed a Wednesday meeting with President Donald Trump over his threats to acquire Greenland.\n\n“We have been working very hard in our department, even though there are not many of us,” Motzfeldt said, per a translation by Clash Report, during an interview with Greenland’s Kalaallit Nunaata Radio on Wednesday.\n\nHer reaction comes after she and Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen met with Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House. The group came together in an effort to address Trump’s pursuit of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“I would not normally like to say these words, but I will say them: We are very strong,” Motzfeldt said. “We are doing our utmost. But the last days, naturally… Oh, I am getting very emotional. I am overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added: “The last days have been tough. Our preparations and the increasing pressure that has been intense. But I want to say, we are strong in the government. The work is to ensure the the Greenlandic people in our country can feel safe and live securely. We are using all our strength to achieve this as we continue the work.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump hasn’t let up on his desire to take over Greenland. During an interview with press, per Politico, Rasmussen said he and his team hit a roadblock with Trump over the region.\n\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen said Wednesday. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland. We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe post Greenland Official Chokes Up After Trump Meeting Over US Acquisition Talk: ‘I Am Overwhelmed’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "The advice from five legal experts boiled down to a blunt workplace reality: employees should watch their mouth if they want to keep their job.",
    "fullText": "Hours after President Donald Trump toured a Ford pickup truck assembly plant, the big news story wasn't about manufacturing jobs or the economy. It was about a Ford worker who heckled him and was later suspended.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the limits of free speech in the workplace — and when companies can discipline workers for political protest.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to five experts, including four employment lawyers and an HR executive, to find out.\n\nTheir conclusion was blunt: an employee's words can quickly become fireable offenses.\n\nAll four lawyers said workers retain legal free speech rights under the Constitution, but those rights rarely protect speech in their workplace.\n\n\"With very few exceptions, employees in the private sector don't have free speech rights at work,\" Mark Kluger, a co-founding partner at New Jersey-based law firm Kluger Healey, told Business Insider.\n\nJessica Childress, a managing attorney at Washington, DC-based The Childress Firm, said workers often confuse who the First Amendment actually applies to. The best way to think about it, she said, is to divide government action from a private company's authority.\n\n\"The First Amendment's right to freedom of speech only applies to government actors, not private employers, such as Ford,\" she said. \"A private company can — with certain exceptions — limit what their employees say.\"\n\nThat distinction has played out in real-world cases before.\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman, a former marketing analyst for a government contractor, was fired from her job after professional photographers caught her giving Trump's motorcade the middle finger.\n\nEven though her action happened outside of the office, her lawsuit against her employer was tossed.\n\n\"Employers are legally allowed to regulate behavior that disrupts the workplace,\" said Jared Pope, an employment law attorney and CEO at Work Shield. \"That is why most organizations apply their codes of conduct consistently, even when speech happens off the clock or references public figures.\"\n\nStill, lawyers said workers generally have more protection if they express their political belief off-the-clock.\n\n\"If you are so inclined to protest, do it off-duty, off-premises, and off-company networks,\" Eric Kingsley, a partner at Kingsley Szamet Employment Lawyers, told Business Insider. \"An employer has the ability to discipline an employee for speech in matters of politics when it becomes misconduct.\"\n\nEach lawyer we talked to said that Ford was well within its rights to suspend the employee, T.J. Sabula.\n\nIn fact, some said the automaker may have displayed restraint by not outright firing the factory employee after the decision.\n\n\"It implies Ford is buying time,\" Kingsley added. \"Suspending the employee gives them a chance to investigate and make a decision that may not be as rash as laying off an employee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Auto Workers, the union representing the workers in Sabula's plant, confirmed his suspension. Sabula, who has said he doesn't regret heckling Trump and is set to receive over $800,000 in crowdfunded support, has not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaura Dickerson, a vice president for the UAW, said the union was reviewing Ford's actions and said workers \"should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe union also said Sabula \"believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nFord declined to comment on the suspension, saying it was \"a personnel matter.\"\n\n\"Ford is navigating a high-profile, politically charged moment,\" Lauren Winans, CEO of the HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, said. \"The union's involvement likely influenced Ford's decision to suspend (not fire), because unilateral termination could lead to grievances and arbitration.\"\n\nFor workers wondering if they can get fired for speaking their mind at work, Kluger made it clear the answer is yes.\n\n\"Try telling your boss what you really think of them and see how long you remain employed,\" he said.",

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "description": "Edward...",
    "fullText": "The president wants to resume nuclear testing.  Is he a warmonger or just an idiot?\n\nIt would be a mistake of radioactive proportions to resume nuclear testing. None of the three major nuclear powers—the United States, Russia, and China—has conducted a nuclear test since 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was approved. The CTBT bans all nuclear tests worldwide and has been signed by 187 nations. The only country that has conducted nuclear tests this century is North Korea, which is universally regarded as a rogue state—not exactly the kind of company we should be keeping.\n\nInstead of deterring foreign nations, renewed testing would be like setting off, well, a nuclear chain reaction, with the US triggering Russia and China to ramp up their own testing, which would then likely trigger other countries to do so as well.\n\nBut while Beijing and Moscow may have much to gain from testing their nuclear weapons, the United States does not. The US has already conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests, more than all other nations combined. (By comparison, China has conducted 45 tests). We spend $25 billion each year to sustain the country’s nuclear warheads, including funding the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which maintains the weapons without explosive nuclear testing and includes room-size supercomputers, the world’s most powerful X-ray machine, and a laser system the size of a sports stadium. No other nation possesses such an extensive array of tools for nonnuclear testing.\n\nTrump’s own advisers are confident that our nuclear weapons work—just as they are confident that other countries are not testing their nuclear weapons. Trump’s nominee to run the US Strategic Command, Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll, told Congress in October, “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test.”\n\nIn the face of such facts, Trump changed his story. He said that Russia and China are conducting secret nuclear tests and people “just don’t know about it.” According to Trump, “You don’t necessarily know where they’re testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test.”\n\nWhat Trump seems to be referring to are very small nuclear tests that are hard to detect and are sometimes referred to as “hydronuclear” tests. If Russia and China are conducting them, it would be in violation of the CTBT. But there is no proof that this is happening. Moreover, even if it were, renewed US nuclear testing would still not be justified. Even small US tests would give Russia and China the green light to conduct many large nuclear tests that would be much more useful. A better approach for the United States would be to seek greater transparency of global test sites.\n\nIt appears that Trump’s utter confusion—not any need to resume nuclear testing—is the root cause of this entire kerfuffle. Russia recently tested two new missiles—the Poseidon and the Skyfall—that Putin has said can evade US missile defenses. Crucially, however, there were no nuclear warheads—the part that goes “boom”—on these missiles. Trump is apparently mixing up the testing of missiles and the testing of nuclear bombs.\n\nSuch errors are harmful enough, but Trump has added to the danger by upping the ante in other ways. He continues to insist that he will build his space-based Golden Dome missile-defense system, which would cost more than $3 trillion. Yet scientists say that such missile-defense systems, like Reagan’s “Star Wars” boondoggle (or the scenario depicted in Kathryn Bigelow’s recent film A House of Dynamite), will not work. Instead of Golden Dome, it should be called Golden Sieve—it will cost a lot of money, and it will not be effective. And, once again, instead of reducing tensions, Trump is increasing them: Nations will respond to US long-range-missile defenses by building more offensive missiles.\n\nIf Trump actually wants to reduce the risk of nuclear war, as he claims, he should not build the Golden Dome. Instead, he should reach for the Golden Phone. He should talk to Putin and accept his invitation to stick with the New START treaty—the last US-Russian agreement to reduce nuclear weapons—which is set to expire in February 2026. Putin has proposed a one-year extension; the United States has yet to respond.\n\nIs Trump a warmonger or just an idiot? Is he hell-bent on starting a new nuclear arms race, or is he simply confused about the difference between a nuclear bomb test and a missile test? As horrific as it sounds, Trump may be on the verge of undermining US and global security—just so he doesn’t have to admit that he was wrong.",

    "fullText": "The order follows a nine-month investigation and includes broad exemptions for datacenters and consumers\n\nDonald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain AI chips, such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor ​and a similar semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X, under a new national security order released by the White House.\n\nThe proclamation follows a nine-month investigation under ‌section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and targets a number of high-end semiconductors meeting certain performance benchmarks and devices containing them for import duties. The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.\n\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.\n\nThe White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.\n\nShares of Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.\n\nTrump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.\n\nThat move followed a year-long “Section 301” unfair trade practices investigation into China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nQuestions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.\n\nTrump last year announced he would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips. Legal ‌experts questioned whether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.\n\nThe Trump administration this week required that China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.\n\nTrump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.\n\nWhile US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.\n\nTrump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.\n\nAn annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second term has been eventful. You wouldn’t know it from his approval numbers.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from January found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance as president. That’s virtually unchanged from March 2025, shortly after he took office for the second time.\n\nThe new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does show subtle signs of vulnerability for the Republican president. Trump hasn’t convinced Americans that the economy is in good shape, and many question whether he has the right priorities when he’s increasingly focused on foreign intervention. His approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has also slipped since he took office.\n\nHere’s how Americans’ views of Trump have — and haven’t — changed over the past year, according to AP-NORC polling.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans consistently approved of Trump's performance\n\nCall it a gift or a curse — for all his unpredictability, Trump's approval numbers just don't change very much.\n\nThis was largely the case during his first term in office, too. Early in his first term, 42% of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency. There were some ups and downs over the ensuing years, but he left office with almost the same approval.\n\nThat level of consistency on presidential approval numbers could be the new normal for U.S. politics — or it could be unique to Trump. Gallup polling since the 1950s shows that presidential approval ratings have grown less variable over time. But President Joe Biden had a slightly different experience. Biden, a Democrat, entered the White House with higher approval numbers than Trump has ever received, but those fell rapidly during his first two years in office, then stayed low for the remainder of his term.\n\nMost Americans have held a critical view of Trump throughout his time in office, and Americans are twice as likely to say he's focused on the wrong priorities than the right ones. About half of U.S. adults say he’s mostly focusing on the wrong priorities one year into his second term, and approximately 2 in 10 say he’s mostly focused on the right priorities. Another 2 in 10, roughly, say it’s been about an even mix, and 14% say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe economy has haunted Trump in his first year back in the White House, despite his insistence that “the Trump economic boom has officially begun.”\n\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy. That’s up slightly from 31% in December — which marked a low point for Trump — but Trump started out with low approval on this issue, which doesn’t give him a lot of room for error.\n\nThe economy is a new problem for Trump. His approval rating on this issue in his first term fluctuated, but it was typically higher. Close to half of Americans approved of Trump’s economic approach for much of his first White House stint, and he’s struggled to adjust to this as a weak point. Americans care a lot more about costs than they did in Trump’s first term, and, like Biden, he’s persistently asserted that the U.S. economy is not a problem while the vast majority describe it as “poor.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump has done more to hurt the cost of living in his second term, while only about 2 in 10 say he’s done more to help. About one-quarter say he hasn't made an impact.\n\nViews of Trump’s handling of immigration have declined\n\nWhen Trump entered office, immigration was among his strongest issues. It’s since faded, a troubling sign for Trump, who campaigned on both economic prosperity and crackdowns to illegal immigration.\n\nJust 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. The poll was conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.\n\nBut there are signs that Americans still give Trump some leeway on immigration issues. About half of U.S. adults say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, which is unchanged since April, despite an immigration crackdown that spread to cities across the U.S. in the second half of the year.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, say Trump has helped immigration and border security “a lot” or “a little” in his second term. This is an area where Democrats are more willing to give Trump some credit. About 2 in 10 Democrats say Trump has helped on this issue, higher than the share of Democrats who say he's helped on costs or job creation.\n\nAs Trump turns to foreign policy, most Americans disapprove of his approach\n\nTrump has focused his attention more on foreign policy in his second term, and polling shows most Americans disapprove of his approach.\n\nBut much like Trump's overall approval, views of his handling of foreign policy have changed little in his second term, despite wide-ranging actions including his push to control Greenland and the recent military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of foreign policy, and most Americans, 56%, say Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries.\n\nTrump’s continued focus on global issues could be a liability given its sharp contrast with the “America First” platform he ran on and Americans’ growing concern with costs at home. But it could also be hard to shift views on the issue — even if Trump takes more dramatic action in the coming months.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,203 adults was conducted Jan. 8-11 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is pointing the finger at an unlikely target after his much-touted efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine failed to gain traction.\n\nAsked why U.S.-led peace talks have stalled, Trump blamed the victim of the invasion, claiming it was the Ukrainian leader’s fault. Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "description": "Nobel economist Paul Krugman says that reviving an Obama-era consumer watchdog would be a low-effort was to protect Americans.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump has unveiled a slew of proposals aimed at making life more affordable for everyday Americans, but according to one top economist, there's something that would make a bigger difference than anything the president has floated so far.\n\nTrump has laid out plans to tackle everything from mortgage rates to credit card debt to energy costs. Yet, Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman thinks those options pale in comparison to one move Trump could make with relative ease: reviving an Obama-era consumer watchdog.\n\nIn an analysis of Trump's plans posted on his Substack, Krugman laid out the problems he sees with credit card lending practices in the US, noting that Trump's move to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be rolled back.\n\n\"This would immediately help Americans with credit card debt, and many other struggling American families as well,\" he said. \"No legislation would be required, since the CFPB was established by law. If Trump really wants to cap credit card interest rates, he should reach across the aisle and get legislation passed with Democratic support.\"\n\nKrugman said there's a strong case for government involvement in the industry, and that such a move would directly benefit US consumers.\n\n\"In straight economic terms there is a valid case for government intervention to protect consumers by reducing credit card interest rates,\" he wrote. \"There is also a valid case for action to end other abusive credit card practices, such as exorbitant late fees.\"\n\nThe economist said that while he agrees with the president's plan to deliver relief from high credit card rates, he doesn't think it will garner the support needed from Congress. Bringing back the CFBP, however, would require minimal effort, Krugman said.\n\nKrugman's perspective on the benefits of an interest rate cap runs counter to the views of other finance pros. Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi recently told Business Insider that the plan would likely result in lower credit availability for many borrowers, particularly middle- and lower-income households.\n\nAnalysts from UBS had a similar view this week, arguing that Trump's plan could also hit GDP growth by sparking a decline in consumer spending.",

    "description": "Brooke Rollins suggested eating ‘a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing’ as Americans struggle to put food on the table",
    "fullText": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has been mocked online over a “depression meal” she suggested for Americans after the Trump administration turned the food pyramid upside down.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture recently released new dietary guidelines, suggesting Americans eat more protein, dairy and healthy fats and less whole grains. Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously said he was on a so-called carnivore diet, told Americans when rolling out the guidelines to “eat real food.”\n\nIn a TV appearance on Wednesday, Rollins suggested an affordable, albeit lackluster, meal Americans can make that sticks to the new guidelines.\n\n“We've run over 1,000 simulations. It can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing. And so, there is a way to do this that actually will save the average American consumer money,” Rollins told News Nation.\n\nA clip of Rollins' comments was shared online, and social media users were quick to poke fun at the out-of-touch dining suggestion.\n\n“Private jets and tax breaks for them and their rich friends, and one piece of broccoli *AND* a tortilla for you!” Chasten Glezman Buttigieg, the husband of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, wrote on X.\n\nMarlow Stern, who teaches at the Columbia Journalism School, posted, “‘You should eat prison meals’ prob not the best message.”\n\n“One whole tortilla?!” Democratic strategist Jennifer Holdsworth sarcastically said.\n\nFred Wellman, podcast host and Democratic Congressional candidate, wrote, “They hate so much of America. They just hate them.”\n\n“Are they doing Monte Carlo simulations to create the most affordable r/depressionmeal,” Tyson Brody, who identifies as an opposition researcher, posted.\n\nWhile inflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, grocery prices remained high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Uncooked ground beef was up 15.5 percent, and frozen fish and seafood increased 8.6 percent year-on-year.\n\nHealth experts Lauren Ball and Emily Burch weighed in on the new dietary guidelines’ lack of attention to socio-economic issues when it comes to food.\n\n“Access to affordable, healthy food remains limited across the US, especially for people in low-income communities, rural areas, or those working long and unpredictable hours,” the two wrote for The Independent. “People choose food based on whether it’s affordable, accessible and culturally relevant – but the guidelines overlooked these structural drivers.”",

    "fullText": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Iranian government is at its weakest point in years, destabilizing yet another OPEC nation less than two weeks after the United States toppled the government of Venezuela.\n\nProtests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government’s deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran.\n\nIran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world’s most important oil shipping lanes. Those factors will shape the country’s future, regardless of whether the US intervenes.\n\nIran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world’s sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers .To skirt sanctions, Iran operates a shadow fleet of vessels to export oil at a steep discount.\n\nBut Iran’s potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 million barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And its daily production is less than half the 6.5 million barrels per day Iran produced in the mid-1970s before revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.\n\nLike Venezuela, China is by far Iran’s biggest customer: It buys 89% of Iran’s oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don’t end there: Iran also nationalized the country’s energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies’ assets in past decades.\n\nBut Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela.\n\n“Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.”\n\nThe price of oil has already risen sharply because of the threat of disruption to Iran’s oil. Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a year before an American military operation deposed Nicolás Maduro, a senior aide to President Donald Trump argued that the Venezuelan leader had been dispatching gang members into the United States.\n\n\"If you’re a dictator of a poor country with a high crime rate, wouldn’t you send your criminals to our open border?” Stephen Miller told reporters in the closing stretch of Trump's 2024 comeback campaign.\n\nMiller now serves as the White House chief of staff for policy, where he plays a prominent role in promoting Trump's policy agenda. His bombastic style and zero-sum worldview have made him a lightning rod within the administration. Critics argue that Miller’s rhetoric about foreign nations and immigrants echoes racist and imperialist ideas that have undergirded military actions by the U.S. and other nations for centuries.\n\nA joint statement from the governments of Spain and five Latin American countries following the Venezuela operation called for countries in the region to engage in “mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and nonintervention,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the administration's Venezuela policy “old-fashioned imperialism.”\n\n“Advocating for policies that put American citizens first isn’t racist. Anyone who says so is either intentionally lying or just plain stupid,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.\n\nHere's a look at how Miller laid the rhetorical groundwork for this month's attack on Venezuela and what his comments say about the administration's broader worldview.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations’ aid to developing world was ‘reverse colonization’\n\nShortly after the U.S. operation that captured Maduro, Miller wrote on social media: “Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful). The West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry. The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.\"\n\nMiller argues that Venezuelan oil was stolen from US oil industry\n\nTwo weeks before Maduro's arrest, Miller in December echoed arguments by Trump that the Venezuelan oil industry was stolen from American oil companies:\n\n“American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs,” Miller wrote on social media.\n\nMiller says Venezuelan government is in service to US\n\nMiller in January claimed to reporters that U.S. military power had ensured compliance from the Caracas government.\n\n“We have an oil embargo in Venezuela for them to do any kind of commerce. They need our permission. We have our massive fleet or armada still present there. This is an active and ongoing U.S. government military operation, and so, of course, we set the terms and conditions,\" Miller said.\n\nHe added: “Our conversations are that we are very much getting full, complete and total cooperation from the government of Venezuela, and as a result of that cooperation, the people of Venezuela are going to become richer than they ever have before. And of course, the United States is going to benefit from this massively in terms of economic, security and military cooperation, counter-narcotics, counterterrorism and every other dimension of our security.\"\n\nMiller calls for a world order based on strength, says US military occupation of Greenland would not be opposed\n\nDuring a wide-ranging January interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Miller repeatedly argued for the primacy of American power and criticized the international order the U.S. once led.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller also dismissed concerns that Trump's vows to take Greenland from Denmark, a fellow member of the NATO military alliance, may trigger a military conflict with Europe.\n\n“Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations engaged in ‘groveling’ to former colonies\n\nIn the same interview, Miller said it would be “absurd and preposterous” and “not even a serious question” to propose the administration support Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's bid to lead the country because the military would not back her.\n\nTapper then asked whether the South American country should hold elections.\n\nMiller replied: “The United States is using its military to secure our interests unapologetically in our hemisphere. We’re a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower. It is absurd that we would allow a nation in our own backyard to become the supplier of resources to our adversaries, but not to us, to hoard weapons from our adversaries, to be able to be positioned as an asset against the United States, rather than on behalf of the United States.”\n\nThe anchor pressed Miller on whether sovereign countries had the right to conduct their own affairs.\n\nMiller explained the administration’s stance: “The Monroe Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine is all about securing the national interest of America. For years, we sent our soldiers to die in deserts in the Middle East to try to build them parliaments, to try to build them democracies, to try to give them more oil, try to give them more resources. The future of the free world, Jake, depends on America being able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology.\" He called for an end to \"This whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and engaging in these massive reparations schemes.”\n\nHe also defended the administration's operation and echoed his past claims that Maduro had sent criminals into the U.S.: “We’re not going to let tinpot communist dictators send rapists into our country, send drugs into our country, send weapons into our country.\"\n\nMiller criticizes anti-ICE protests following immigration crackdown in Minneapolis\n\nMiller has returned to promoting the administration's stance on domestic issues like immigration and partisan politics.\n\nOn Tuesday, following nationwide protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota, Miller wrote on social media: “Americans voting overwhelmingly for mass deportation. Congress passed laws requiring it and then passed new legislation to fully fund it. The response of the Democrat Party and its activists has been to support and orchestrate violent resistance against federal law enforcement.”\n\nHe later added in a separate post, “In case it isn’t clear by now, if Democrats won they would have made every city into Mogadishu or Kabul or Port-au-Prince.\"",

    "title": "Why this legal expert says the Minnesota and Illinois immigration lawsuits ‘are close to completely meritless’",
    "description": "Illinois and Minnesota sued the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown. But they have a tough road ahead of them in court, one legal analyst says.",
    "fullText": "Over the last several months, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen a dramatic escalation in federal immigration enforcement along their chilly streets, with agents arresting thousands – including some US citizens – in neighborhoods, shopping centers, schools and at protests.\n\nThe surge is the result of the Trump administration’s commitment to cracking down on immigration, concentrated in Democratic-led cities, and follows weeks of growing tensions between the federal government and local Midwestern officials who have long implored for an end to the operations.\n\nIllinois and Minnesota, joined by their city counterparts, are now separately pursuing legal action against the administration, filing lawsuits Monday in federal courts over immigration enforcement they call unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nA judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order in the Minnesota lawsuit during a status conference Wednesday morning, but said her decision “should not be considered a prejudgment.”\n\nThe lawsuit presents “somewhat frontier issues in constitutional law,” US District Judge Katherine Menendez said. A hearing has not yet been scheduled in Illinois.\n\nThe road ahead for both suits appears dim, with their likelihood for success small, one expert says.\n\nElie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst, has closely followed the turmoil in Chicago and the Twin Cities. Here, he breaks down the lawsuits, their merits and what’s next in the courtrooms.\n\nSome of the answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: What are Illinois and Minnesota asking for from judges in their lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Fundamentally, both of these states are asking federal judges to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement from enforcing immigration law in their states and cities. There are variations between them, but that’s the core ask. As a backup, both states ask the courts for some sort of ruling or declaration that some of the tactics ICE is using are unconstitutional.\n\nCNN: What are the key differences between the lawsuits?\n\nHonig: The main difference is that Illinois asks to block all ICE activity in the state, whereas Minnesota phrases its ask as seeking to stop this “surge” of officers. But pointing to the surge is legally irrelevant, because whether you’re talking about a group of ICE agents who are already there, or who were added after some point, the fundamental ask is still the same. You’re still asking a judge to block ICE from doing its job as it sees fit in your state.\n\nCNN: What is the legal precedent for an ask like that?\n\nHonig: None. There is no example, nor does either state cite an example in their papers, of a judge prohibiting a federal law enforcement agent from enforcing federal law in a given state. The reaction that we’ve heard from various Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, when confronted with this lack of precedent and lack of case law, is essentially, “Well, this is really bad, though. Well, this is an invasion.” There is plenty of dramatic language in the complaints, but that doesn’t change the legal calculus. You can’t just take a situation that has no legal precedent and no legal support and say, “Well, yes, but our situation is really, really bad, therefore we get to invent new law.”\n\nCNN: In your opinion, how strong do you think the states’ arguments are?\n\nHonig: I think the arguments that both states are making, that ICE should be blocked, either entirely or just the surge, are close to completely meritless. Fundamentally, what they’re asking for is legally completely unwarranted.\n\nCNN: What do you think is the most likely outcome for each suit?\n\nHonig: It’s so dependent on the judge here. But I think the best, realistic scenario for the states is – if they get sympathetic judges who decide to put ICE through its paces – maybe they call in ICE agents as witnesses, or ICE officials as witnesses, probe into ICE’s training, policies and tactics and issue some sort of declaration that ICE needs to do things differently or better. Some sort of window dressing like that is probably the best realistic outcome. There’s no way a judge is going to say, “I hereby block you, ICE, from carrying out enforcement activities.” And if a judge does do that, it’ll be reversed.\n\nCNN: What are the legal principles at play here on the other side?\n\nHonig: First, it’s the Supremacy Clause, which says that the state and local authorities cannot block the feds from carrying out their federal duties. And also Article Two, which gives the federal executive branch the power to enforce federal law. Those are the legal theories that really are in play here.\n\nCNN: If the states’ chances of winning are close to zero, what can be done?\n\nHonig: I’m not saying there’s nothing to be done. This is just not the way to address any abuses or excesses by ICE. If a person has his or her rights violated, if a search is unlawful, if a person is wrongly detained, if a person is injured or killed wrongly by ICE, they can sue. They can go to court and seek specific redress for their specific injuries. What the courts are not supposed to do, first of all, is prohibit the federal executive branch from carrying out federal executive branch prerogatives and, secondly, issue blanket theoretical advisory rulings about the way the world ought to look or ought not to look. Cases need to be about specific injury and specific redress, and these lawsuits are not that.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October 2025 after it federalized and tried to deploy the Illinois National Guard, also arguing in part that it violated the 10th Amendment. The state was successful in that case and Trump has largely backed off National Guard deployment there for now. What are the key differences between that case and this one over immigration enforcement?\n\nHonig: The National Guard was an entirely different case where Trump used a specific law, Section 12406, to deploy the National Guard. The Supreme Court offered a very specific and nuanced definition of the term “regular forces,” and whether that meant regular law enforcement forces, or regular military forces. So that case was based on the action Trump took that was based on a specific federal statute, and the Supreme Court construed and defined that statute against the Trump administration. Legally, it’s a completely different scenario from what we have here.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Minnesota filed their suits Monday; the latter also filing a temporary restraining order request. What happens now?\n\nHonig: One of two things. One, the judges can just reject these out of hand. I think that’s unlikely. I think the judges are going to want to hear further from the parties. The judges might decide to hold fact-finding hearings, they might decide, “I want to dig into what ICE is doing a bit.” That’s all within the broad discretion of these district court judges. I think those are the next steps, but if a district court judge is to say, “ICE, you can’t go in there, you can’t go into that state, you can’t go into that city,” I think that will get reversed real quick.\n\nCNN: Is there a timeline we can anticipate here for how quickly the judges may act on these lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Judges are in charge of handling their own dockets and calendars. I would assume judges would understand that these are fairly immediate and emergent issues and would want to get the parties in court within days, not months.",

    "title": "Trump Imposes Limited Tariffs on Foreign Semiconductors",
    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "description": "Betting odds for who might succeed Powell have shifted. Bettors also think there's a growing chance Powell stays on as governor past the end of his term.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump could be fighting with the Fed all year.\n\nIn the days since it was revealed that the US Department of Justice is investigating Jerome Powell, a growing view among investors and analysts is that the Fed chair could end up sticking around after his term ends in May.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation relates to Powell's congressional testimony about the Fed's building renovations, and Trump has said he had no knowledge of the probe.\n\nStill, markets have interpreted the move as another attempt to influence the Fed to cut interest rates. They're also increasingly betting that the president's fight with the Fed will probably last beyond the end of Powell's term.\n\nSome say the latest developments have made it more likely that Powell will choose to stay on the Fed's board of governors even after his term as Fed Chair.\n\nOn Polymarket, the odds that Powell will leave the Fed board by the end of May and the end of December both plunged shortly after Powell released his video responding to the probe on January 11.\n\nBettors think there's a 45% chance Powell will leave the Fed by May 30, down from 74% earlier this month. They see a 62% chance he will leave the Fed by the end of the year, down from 85% earlier in the month.\n\nBetting markets have also repriced the odds that Trump ally Kevin Hassett is nominated to replace Powell. Kevin Warsh, a more hawkish name on the list for Fed chair, began to pull ahead of Hassett on Polymarket around the time news of the DOJ probe began to circulate.\n\nAs far as lowering interest rates is concerned, Trump's fight with the Fed could end up having the opposite outcome the president is hoping for, according to Chris Whalen, analyst and chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.\n\n\"You're going to have a more hawkish FOMC as we have now, and then you're going to have Chairman Powell sitting there as a governor for the next two years till the end of Trump's term. That's not what they wanted,\" Whalen told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nThere's a reason markets see the latest pressure on Powell backfiring. The logic goes something like this:\n\n\"I think that Trump is in perilous waters right now when it comes to his Fed appointment,\" Whalen added. \"I think Kevin Hassett may be done.\"\n\nThe investigation into Powell could also delay the confirmation of the next Fed Chair.\n\n\"I always thought there was an informal agreement since last summer between Trump and Powell, that if Powell agrees to leave the Fed when his chairmanship ends in May, then Trump will not bring up the construction project anymore,\" Clifton told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to how Trump criticized the Fed's multibillion renovation before the president cooled criticism of the central bank through the second half of the year.\n\n\"That line was crossed on Sunday one way or another,\" Clifton said. \"It makes it more likely that Powell can stay on a seat as a regular member.\"\n\nIt also means Powell could become a \"shadow Fed Chair\" himself, Clifton suggested, referring to an idea the Trump administration floated about an incoming central bank chief who can influence monetary policy expectations before the end of Powell's term.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump has mishandled the Fed. The way to have dealt with this was to simply say, 'You know, he hasn't done a good job. We're looking forward to getting a new chairman.' That's it,\" Whalen said, adding that he now expected Powell to stay on the Fed's board until his term as governor ends in 2028. \"By attacking Powell personally, continuously, I think they're not going to get what they want.\"",

Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a period of five years. Trump also called Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday to discuss the issue.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Mike Johnson has thrown cold water on the idea, saying that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy, including the possibility that credit card companies would \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nBusiness leaders have offered mixed reviews of Trump's proposal, with some making the same argument as Johnson.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Citi's chief financial officer, Mark Mason, said on a call with reporters. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"",

The brief visit was intended to highlight the White House's commitment to rebuilding the US workforce and Ford's focus on rebuilding a blue-collar workforce pipeline.\n\nVideo from the event obtained by TMZ shows Trump gesturing after someone shouted \"pedophile protector\" — which Sabula has since said was him — in an apparent reference to White House's delay in releasing the full Epstein files. The President can be seen raising his middle finger after the remark and mouthing an expletive.\n\nThe White House told several news outlets that Trump was appropriately responding to \"a lunatic\" who \"was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.\"\n\nA source at the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union that represents the Ford plant, confirmed to Business Insider that Sabula was suspended.\n\n\"The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union—the UAW,\" Laura Dickerson, the vice president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), told Business Insider in an email.\n\n\"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nDickerson said the UAW is reviewing Sabula's suspension.\n\n\"Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States,\" she added.\n\nSabula told the Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I don't feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,\" he added.\n\n\"TJ and his family greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time, we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support,\" read an update on both campaigns. \"We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\"\n\n\"TJ Sabula is a patriot,\" said one of the GoFundMe campaigns, which more than 21,000 people donated to.\n\n\"Let's rally and support TJ and help him pay some bills (and force DJT to release the Trump/Epstein Files),\" continues the post, which was published last night.\n\nIn November, Trump signed a bipartisan bill called the Epstein Files Transparency Act that required the release of all FBI materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein by December 19, 2025. While some files have been released, the Department of Justice said it's still scrambling to review around 5.2 million remaining documents weeks after the mandated release date.\n\n\"TJ Sabula, a worker at the Ford Rouge Plant, voiced concerns about President Donald J Trump during the president's visit to the plant. Ford responded by suspending TJ without pay,\" reads a second GoFundMe organized by Diandra Gourlay, which has raised money from over 13,000 people.\n\nGourlay described herself as \"a longtime personal friend of the Sabula family.\"\n\nBoth GoFundMe campaigns list \"Thomas Sabula\" as the official beneficiary of the donations.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump posted a baffling social media post demanding that a U.S. citizen and Democratic congresswoman be “thrown out” of the country.\n\nThe president has been raging against Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for more than a month after news broke that some members of the Somali diaspora had allegedly defrauded the state of Minnesota by billing for social services that were never provided.\n\n“They should be thrown out of the USA. Get it done, NOW! That includes their loser Rep. Omar, who married her brother (gross!),” Trump wrote Wednesday on his platform Truth Social.\n\nHe then shared an interview with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, saying the state’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz “should be in cuffs.”\n\nNeither Walz nor Omar, who fled Somalia’s civil war as a child, has been accused of any involvement in the fraud scheme.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who the president was addressing or how he envisioned “throwing out” Omar, since it’s unconstitutional to deport an American citizen. The 43-year-old spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before being granted asylum and moving to the U.S., becoming a citizen in 2000 at age 17.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Omar, Walz, and the White House for comment.\n\nThe president apparently became fixated on the idea of “throwing out” Omar after he saw a video, which he shared on Christmas Day, of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly calling Omar’s citizenship into question.\n\n“Throw her out of the U.S., Now!” he wrote.\n\nHe also railed against her last month at a Cabinet meeting at the White House and a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people that work. These are people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain,” he told his Cabinet.\n\nLess than a week later, he took the stage at a rally in Pennsylvania and announced a “permanent pause” on migration from “hellholes” like Somalia, and once again raged against Omar until the crowd began chanting, “Send her back!”\n\nThe lawmaker responded by calling out Trump’s obsession with her, which she described as “creepy” and “weird.”\n\n“Trump’s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help,” she wrote on social media. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he’s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment.”",

    "description": "Citi's CFO Mark Mason said Trump's proposed credit card cap would have a 'deleterious' impact on the economy.",
    "fullText": "Citi's top executives warned that President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates could have dire consequences.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"\n\nMason said multiple times that he did not want to speculate on the impact of the potential cap, given the limited available information. He said that Citi would work with the Trump administration to address the \"important issue\" of affordability.\n\nReporters asked Mason about the cap multiple times, and he repeatedly said it would likely not help customers most in need, as is Trump's stated intention. He said later in the call that, again, it would have a \"very negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nOn the bank's earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said that \"a rate cap is not something that we can support\" when asked about the news that Bilt Rewards is releasing three cards with interest rates capped at 10%, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"To be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended,\" Fraser continued.\n\nMuch like Mason did on an earlier call, Fraser acknowledged the importance of affordability and said she's keen to collaborate with the administration.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. He argued that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. A cap would have to be approved by Congress, and similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nOther bank leaders, including JPMorgan's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, have warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; however, others in the financial sector have applauded the plan.\n\nCiti's profits fell 13% in the fourth quarter, to $2.47 billion, brought down partly by the sale of its operations in Russia, the bank said in an earnings report.\n\nThe bank saw an 84% surge in financial advisory fees in the fourth quarter. The investment banking unit has been reenergized under its new head, JPMorgan veteran Viswas Raghavan. Investment banking revenues increased by 38%, the bank said, and investment banking fees rose 35%.\n\nCiti said that its \"Transformation\" — a years-long effort to modernize the bank and cut costs— is more than 80% complete, as stated in its earnings presentation. Fraser's attempted turnaround has included layoffs, new hires, and multibillion-dollar investments.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has helped boost a parabolic rally that's pushing gold and silver prices higher.\n\nA slew of geopolitical events and initiatives related to interest rates the president has kicked off in recent weeks has driven investors to gold, silver, and industrial metals like copper and tin.\n\nThe latest spike marks a new leg of the so-called debasement trade, which sees investors scooping up assets like gold and silver on fears that the US dollar and other currencies could be devalued.\n\nMarkets got a glimpse of the trend last year, when Trump's tariffs fueled a bout of panic selling in US stock and Treasurys, and a flight to store-of-value assets like gold.\n\nAfter finishing 2025 with its best performance in decades, gold is up another 5% so far this year.\n\nSilver, which also notched its best run since 1979 last year, is up 25% year-to-date, its best-ever start to the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar Index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined 1% from its latest peak in November.\n\nA brief overview of events this month shows why investors are making the move.\n\nThe \"sell America\" impulse is also evident in how US bonds have sold off while the value of the dollar has declined, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"There are glimpses of the 'sell America' trade that we saw in the first half of last year,\" he wrote in a note on Monday, referring to similar moves in precious metals, bonds, and stocks when Trump first introduced his reciprocal tariffs last April.\n\nThis time, investors appear to be rattled by geopolitical tensions and fears that, if the president puts pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates prematurely, it could stoke inflation down the line,\n\n\"In addition to investors becoming more concerned about potential currency debasement and future inflation, these were supported by the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said of recent moves in gold and silver on Tuesday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, BCA Research highlighted the recent rally in commodities and said it appeared some aspects of the \"'dollar debasement' trades\" were \"on fire\" this week.\n\n\"Gold and silver prices could extend gains as investors double down on 'Sell America' trades, and alternatives to the dollar might grind higher,\" Karl Schamotta, a chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nThe precious metals rally is getting a boost from other forces at play. Gold has been boosted by strong central bank demand in recent years. That, too, is a part of a broader sell America theme that's seen central banks load up on gold to diversify reserves away from the US dollar.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has been increasingly lumped into the AI trade as investors recognize the metal's use in data centers. Its price is also getting a boost from supply pressures and speculative trading in China.\n\n\"The 'Sell America' theme may be the dominant narrative,\" JPMorgan's market intelligence team said of the broader move in markets on Monday.",

Ives suggested that impeding the industry's progress now could compromise the broader US AI agenda.\n\n\"We believe this will be a continuous back and forth battle between Big Tech players and the Trump administration with data center buildouts an important aspect of fueling the AI Revolution over the coming years,\" Ives added.",

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects Republican President Donald Trump to try to interfere with the midterm elections, and he says raids by immigration agents in major cities are creating a sense of chaos that voters will reject in November.\n\nThe comments were part of a wide-ranging, 20-minute Associated Press telephone interview with the New York Democrat, who argued former Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola's entry into the Senate race gives his party a path to the majority.\n\nSchumer said that economic concerns have begun to cement in the minds of voters and that Democrats have plans to build their campaign around the costs, chaos and corruption they attribute to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has called such Democratic statements “fearmongering” to score political points.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nQ: Some are predicting Trump will try to prevent an open and fair midterm election and would be expected to dispute the results. Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

    "title": "Stephen Miller Torched Over ‘Utterly Chilling’ Message To ICE Officers",
    "description": "Critics slammed the top Trump official's remarks as a \"greenlight for abuse.\"",
    "fullText": "White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller drew sharp condemnation Tuesday over a message he sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during an interview with Fox News host Will Cain.\n\nMiller asserted that ICE agents have “federal immunity in the conduct of your duties” and declared that anyone who touches or obstructs them is “committing a felony.”\n\nLegal experts and commentators pushed back on social media, stressing that prosecuting federal agents is possible, even if it’s often difficult, as a recent HuffPost report explained.\n\nOther critics called Miller’s overall tone “utterly chilling” and a “greenlight for abuse” that amounted to declaring “open season” for ICE agents “on immigrants AND citizens alike” and encouraged officers to “go and spread violence and terror.”\n\nNews: Border Czar Frantically Backpedals After Breaking With Kristi Noem Over ICE Shooting\n\nMiller’s remarks came amid heightened scrutiny of ICE following the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nThe anti-immigration hardliner’s full comments were as follows:\n\n“To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one — no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist — can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties. And the Department of Justice has made clear that if officials cross that line into obstruction, into criminal conspiracy against the United States, or against ICE officers, then they will face justice.”\n\nREMINDER. “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. Anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one—no city official, no state official,… pic.twitter.com/xoWDjOctLe\n\n— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) January 13, 2026\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security later shared footage of Miller’s comments on X, formerly Twitter, describing them as a “REMINDER” to ICE officers. See above.\n\nNot just false, utterly chilling. Saying you have a free pass to murder people. The law and constitution are clear. States can arrest federal officials who violate their laws. Period. https://t.co/78OL807KWm\n\n— Norman Ornstein (@NormOrnstein) January 14, 2026\n\nMiller will be directly responsible for the next American that an ICE agent kills. This is a greenlight for abuse and has no basis in actual law. https://t.co/BFDvocB9FX\n\n— Mehdi Hasan (@mehdirhasan) January 14, 2026\n\nThe message here to ICE couldn't be clearer. It's open season, on immigrants AND citizens alike. So fire away, gang! No one is going to stop you!\nAnd why does \"justice\" always sound like a swear word--like something evil--when spoken by @StephenM? https://t.co/mbFEgeHwsi\n\n— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) January 14, 2026\n\nI guess they only ask democratic state and city officials about their obligation to lower the temperatures out there …\n\nBtw ICE dudes, this is not true and you must know in the end this guy does not have your back https://t.co/TODvdr7AfJ\n\n— Kevin Clarke🍺 (@ClarkeAtAmerica) January 14, 2026\n\nNot a word about doing their duty obeying the law and respecting the Constitution. Is it clear now what the message is? Go and spread violence and terror. https://t.co/rWTX1RZoTG\n\n— Henrique Burnay (@HBurnay) January 14, 2026\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong by providing human beings with unlimited power while simultaneously eliminating any legal consequences for exerting that power. We’ve seen this recipe before. A best seller throughout history.\n\nDon’t forget to garnish the dish by dehumanizing the… https://t.co/pL7u6xlOjd\n\n— Sean Silverman: Silverman Bar Exam & LSAT Tutoring (@BarExamTutor) January 14, 2026\n\nHe’s not a lawyer. There is no blanket “immunity” for criminal behavior. States can and should hold federal officers accountable. https://t.co/og2tilqgr0\n\n— Eli Northrup (@EliNorthrup) January 14, 2026\n\nAmong the most glaring issues of this statement: qualified immunity, which is what ICE officers are covered under, does not shield them from prosecution for ********* conduct, civil rights abuses, or excessive force.* https://t.co/S0PVdCmoFJ\n\n— Evan Rosenfeld (@Evan_Rosenfeld) January 14, 2026\n\nICE agents do NOT have blanket \"federal immunity\" to violate the Constitution, assault citizens, or conduct warrantless home invasions. Obstruction is a crime, but so is unlawful force by officers.\n\n— Molly Ploofkins (@Mollyploofkins) January 14, 2026\n\nThe worst person you knew in high school is giving the dumbest people you knew in high school permission to kill you with impunity and no fear of repercussion. https://t.co/X8WFyluhX6\n\n— lindol (@lindol22) January 14, 2026\n\n— Randall Hunt (@ranman) January 14, 2026\n\nTrump’s Attempt At A Big Brag Prompts The Mocking Question: ‘Who’s Gonna Tell Him?’\n\nRFK Jr. Offers Unfiltered Take On Trump’s Diet: ‘I Don’t Know How He’s Alive…’\n\nTrump Interview Takes Very Awkward Turn: 'When Did I Do That?'",
