    "fullText": "LIMA, Peru (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday expressed concern that China was costing Peru its sovereignty in solidifying control over the South American nation's critical infrastructure, a blunt warning after a Peruvian court ruling restricted a local regulator's oversight of a Chinese-built mega port.\n\nThe $1.3 billion deepwater port in Chancay, north of Peru's capital of Lima, has become a symbol of China's foothold in Latin America and a lightning rod for tensions with Washington.\n\nThe U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on social media that it was “concerned about latest reports that Peru could be powerless to oversee Chancay, one of its largest ports, which is under the jurisdiction of predatory Chinese owners.\"\n\nIt added: “We support Peru’s sovereign right to oversee critical infrastructure in its own territory. Let this be a cautionary tale for the region and the world: cheap Chinese money costs sovereignty.”\n\nThe concern comes as the Trump administration seeks to assert dominance over the Western Hemisphere, where China has long built influence through massive loans and high trade volumes.\n\nThe Chinese government on Thursday strongly rejected the U.S. comments.\n\n“China firmly opposes and strongly deplores the U.S.’s blatant rumor-mongering and smearing of Chancay port,” said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian at a daily briefing in Beijing.\n\nChancay, along the Pacific coast, is part of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an infrastructure program that has seen Chinese state-owned banks offer sizable loans or financial guarantees to construct seaports, airports and highways, among other projects, across multiple continents.\n\nAs Latin America's deepest port, Chancay is capable of berthing some of the world’s largest cargo ships traveling between Asia and South America. China has been Peru’s biggest trading partner for more than a decade now.\n\nChina’s state-owned shipping and logistics company Cosco, a majority shareholder in the port, dismissed the U.S. claims.\n\nIn response to questions from The Associated Press, it said the court ruling “in no way involves aspects of sovereignty\" and insisted that the port remains \"under the jurisdiction, sovereignty and control of Peruvian authorities, subject to all Peruvian regulations.”\n\nIt added there were plenty of Peruvian authorities monitoring the port's activities, including police forces, environmental regulators and customs officials.\n\nThe ruling issued Jan. 29 by a lower court judge orders Peruvian authorities to refrain from exercising “powers of regulation, supervision, oversight and sanction” over the port in Chancay.\n\nThe regulator, Ositran, which has oversight over all of the country's other major ports, said it would appeal the decision, arguing that there was no reason to exempt Cosco Shipping from the agency's oversight.\n\n“(Cosco Shipping) would be the only company providing services to the public that could not be supervised,\" Verónica Zambrano, president of Ositran, told a local radio station Wednesday.\n\nAlthough it's privately owned, the Chancay Port covers 180 hectares (about 445 acres) of Peruvian territory, Zambrano added, making it subject to government efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with local user protection standards.",

    "fullText": "Fox News alienated its viewers after the network ran hours of endless coverage of a high-profile kidnapping, which aired instead of a bipartisan grilling of the president’s top DOJ goon. Attorney General Pam Bondi testified for hours on Wednesday. The hearing was Bondi’s first testimony before Congress since the Department of Justice released millions of files related to disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Fox viewers saw almost none of it, as in total, the Trump-friendly channel aired less than 10 minutes of her nearly 5-hour testimony. During the hearing, she was frequently combative, melted down at questions, and at one point refused to look Epstein victims in the eye as she faced questions about the Trump administration’s handling of the files, among other topics.",

    "description": "President Trump says nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.",
    "fullText": "President Trump said Wednesday that nearly all governors are welcome at the White House for a formal meeting and dinner next week, though the Democratic governors of Maryland and Colorado are still being excluded.\n\nThe White House was initially going to exclude Democratic governors from a formal, typically bipartisan business meeting on Feb. 20 during the annual National Governors Association (NGA) conference, according to the NGA and a source familiar with the White House's planning.\n\nAnd two Democratic governors, Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado, said they were informed by the NGA last Friday they would not be invited to a separate dinner at the White House on Feb. 21 with the president, the governors and their spouses.\n\nBut after talks between the White House and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, the organization and the president said Wednesday that governors from both parties are welcome to both the meeting and the dinner. Democratic governors began receiving invitations on Wednesday evening to the business meeting, though the NGA did not receive updates about the White House dinner.\n\nGov. Stitt informed governors of all 55 states and territories on Wednesday that all are invited to the formal meeting on Feb. 20.\n\n\"He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association's event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling,\" Stitt wrote in a message to governors obtained by CBS News.\n\nIn a Wednesday afternoon Truth Social post after Stitt's message was sent, Mr. Trump wrote that Moore and Polis are still excluded. He suggested there was a misunderstanding between him and Stitt.\n\n\"The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,\" Trump wrote, adding that he \"even invited\" two of his political foes, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \"So, as usual with him, Stitt got it WRONG! The Invitations were sent out to all other Governors, Democrat and Republican.\"\n\nMoore still received an invite on Wednesday to the formal meeting, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt is unclear if Polis received an invitation to that meeting as well. A spokesperson for the Colorado governor said \"no matter what events Colorado is or isn't invited to, Governor Polis will continue to focus on working with his fellow governors and anyone who wants to help make people's lives better.\" CBS News has reached out to the White House.\n\nThe NGA said it was informed by the White House on Feb. 5 that only Republican governors would be invited to the formal business meeting. Because of these exclusions, the NGA said the following day that it would not facilitate that meeting or put it on the group's official schedule. Stitt reiterated that in a letter to governors on Monday, and defended Moore as \"an exceptional vice chair\" for the NGA.\n\nAfter reports of Democratic governors being excluded from the meeting, nearly every Democratic governor put out a joint statement Tuesday that indicated they wouldn't attend any White House events, including the dinner, out of solidarity with Moore and Polis.\n\nIn his Wednesday post, Mr. Trump cited a disagreement over the imprisonment of former Colorado county election clerk Tina Peters as the reason for not inviting Polis. The president has pushed Polis for months to grant clemency to Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence on multiple state charges related to unauthorized access to voting machines.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump called Moore \"foul mouthed\" and claimed he had embellished receiving military medals, though Moore has said it was an \"honest mistake\" on a White House fellowship application in 2006. He has since received a Bronze Star for his deployment to Afghanistan.\n\nThe president also criticized Stitt, calling him a \"RINO,\" or Republican in name only. Stitt had backed Mr. Trump's former opponent, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, during the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.\n\nMoore called the decision not to invite him \"another example of blatant disrespect and a snub to the spirit of bipartisan federal-state partnership\" in a statement earlier this week.\n\nA Polis spokesperson called it a \"disappointing decision for a traditionally bipartisan event between Governors and whomever occupies the White House.\"\n\nGovernors from both parties attended a White House meeting and dinner during last year's conference. The meeting drew attention for a verbal scuffle between Mr. Trump and Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in which the president pressed Mills on the issue of transgender women in sports, and Mills responded: \"We'll see you in court.\"\n\nDetails on new images of subject in Nancy Guthrie disappearance\n\nWatch: Rep.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A former federal prosecutor who quit amid a dispute with the Trump administration is now representing former CNN host Don Lemon, who was one of nine people indicted for their alleged roles in disrupting a service at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official was a pastor.\n\nA court filing Tuesday shows that Lemon has hired former interim U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of major fraud cases for the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office until he resigned last month.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have now left the office at a time of growing frustration with the administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two people by federal officers in Minneapolis.\n\nLemon had previously said through another attorney that he planned to plead not guilty to federal civil rights charges over his coverage of the church protest. He has said he was not affiliated with the group that disrupted the church service, and that he was there in his capacity as an independent journalist. The indictment alleges various actions by the group that entered the church, including what Lemon said as he reported on the event for his livestream show.\n\nLemon is scheduled to be arraigned on Feb. 13 in federal court in St. Paul.\n\nThe Trump administration has cited the Minnesota fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown in the state. Thompson estimated in December that the losses to taxpayers from several fraud cases being prosecuted in Minnesota could total $9 billion.\n\nThompson recently formed his own law firm with Harry Jacobs, another former federal prosecutor who resigned amid the upheaval in the office. Jacobs had been lead prosecutor in the case of Vance Boelter, who has pleaded not guilty in last year's assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the nonfatal shootings of a state senator and his wife.\n\nThe firm's website describes them as “battle tested and seasoned” trial lawyers.\n\nThompson did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump attacked the Republican leader of the National Governors Association on Wednesday as tensions mounted between the White House and the bipartisan group of state leaders ahead of its annual meeting next week.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump blasted Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican who chairs the NGA, as a “RINO,” meaning Republican in Name Only. Trump said Stitt “incorrectly stated my position on the very exclusive Governors Annual Dinner and Meeting at the White House.”\n\nThe dispute centers on whether Trump would allow governors from both major parties to participate in the full range of White House events, which typically includes a business meeting and meal. In a letter to fellow governors on Monday, Stitt said the NGA was informed that the White House planned to limit invitations to the business meeting to Republicans. That prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said they wouldn't participate in the meal if they weren’t fully included at the business meeting.\n\n“I am writing to inform you that President Donald J. Trump is inviting all governors of the 55 States and territories to the Friday, Feb. 20 NGA Business Breakfast at 8:30am est.,” Stitt wrote. “He was very clear in his communications with me that this is a National Governors Association’s event, and he looks forward to hosting you and hearing from governors across the country. President Donald Trump said this was always his intention, and we have addressed the misunderstanding in scheduling.”\n\nTrump, however, struck a far more adversarial tone in his social media post, calling Stitt's Monday letter “false.”\n\n“The invitations were sent to ALL Governors, other than two, who I feel are not worthy of being there,” he wrote, referring to Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Jared Polis of Colorado.\n\nTrump added: “I look forward to seeing the Republican Governors, and some of the Democrats Governors who were worthy of being invited, but most of whom won’t show up.”\n\nFollowing Trump's post, Brandon Tatum, the NGA's chief executive, stood by the group's timeline of events.\n\n“As of Tuesday evening, only Republican Governors received invites from the White House for the Friday morning business meeting,” he said in a statement. “We are hopeful that we can have constructive bipartisan dialogue with the President during the session. Continuing the tradition of the business meeting is an important step toward bridge building among parties.”\n\nFor now, it's unclear how many Democrats will show up at the White House. Some, including Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, said Wednesday they didn't plan to attend the meeting. Others, such as Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, signaled they would participate.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that Trump has “discretion to invite anyone he wants to the White House.”\n\nThe spat is a reminder of the challenge facing bipartisan or nonpartisan organizations in Trump's Washington. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, which includes city leaders from both parties, met in Washington earlier this month but wasn't invited to the White House.\n\nThe governor's meeting, typically a low-key event, took a sharper edge last year when Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe president singled out Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, over his administration's effort to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports. He threatened to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply, prompting Mills to retort, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order, though she is now running for U.S. Senate on a staunch anti-Trump agenda.\n\nThe back-and-forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.",

    "fullText": "Moscow's civil aviation authority said on Wednesday that two major Russian airlines are helping to repatriate its citizens from Cuba amid a jet fuel shortage on the island.\n\nThe agency, Rosaviatsia, said that Rossiya Airlines had changed its flight schedule \"to ensure the evacuation of Russian tourists currently in Cuba.\"\n\nRossiya, which is owned by Russian aviation giant Aeroflot, and Nordwind Airlines, a Russian luxury airline, announced on the same day that they would suspend flights to Cuba and offer only one-way tickets out of the island.\n\nAll parties cited \"difficulties with refueling aircraft in Cuba.\"\n\n\"Starting February 12, a number of one-way return flights will be operated from Havana and Varadero to Moscow to accommodate Russian tourists currently in Cuba,\" wrote Rossiya Airlines.\n\nNordwind Airlines, a Russian leisure airline, said it would fly only repatriation flights from the resort locations of Varadero, Holguin, and Cayo Coco.\n\nThe Russian Union of Travel Industry estimated last week that at least 4,000 Russian tourists are in Cuba.\n\nThe announcements came after Cuban aviation authorities warned on Monday that the island would not have jet fuel available at international airports for a month.\n\nCuba heavily depends on Venezuela for oil, but has stopped receiving imports since January 3, when Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces.\n\nMexico ranks in distant second place as an oil supplier to Cuba, but it also halted exports to the island after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on countries that send oil to Havana.\n\nCanadian airlines, which run some of the highest-traffic routes to Cuba, said they were canceling flights to the island from Monday onward. Air Canada, WestJet, and Air Transat said they would fly empty planes to Cuba to pick up passengers.\n\nThe Russian airlines are following suit.\n\nRossiya said in a follow-up statement that it was organizing at least six one-way flights from Cuban airports to Moscow, and that it would suspend all operations to the island nation by February 24.\n\nBoth Rossiya and Nordwind said they were offering refunds to affected passengers.\n\n\"Both parties are exploring alternative options to resume flights in both directions in the interests of citizens of both countries,\" Rosaviatsia wrote.\n\nCuba has long been considered a close ally of Moscow and a stronghold of Soviet and Russian influence in Latin America.\n\nRussia, isolated by international sanctions for its war against Ukraine, has recently sought to expand economic and trade ties with Cuba, encouraging Russian companies in banking, agriculture, IT, and other industries to begin operations on the island.\n\nIn September, Ukrainian intelligence officials said that the Kremlin recruited over 20,000 Cuban citizens as mercenaries to fight Kyiv's forces, with the island ranking among the top suppliers of foreign fighters.\n\nTrump said earlier this month that his administration was in discussions with Cuba as he ramps up pressure on the island.\n\n\"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba,\" he told reporters.\n\nRussia is not the only one to chafe at Cuba's situation. On Tuesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said at a press briefing that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\"\n\n\"China will, as always, do our best to provide support and assistance to Cuba,\" said spokesperson Lin Jian.",

    "description": "A bipartisan coalition in the House delivered a rare rebuke of Trump's tariffs by voting against his duties on Canada, citing economic concerns.",
    "fullText": "The US and Canada relationship has been tense since President Donald Trump took office a second time and began levvying tariffs on the neighbor to the north and throwing around the term \"51st state.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Congress delivered a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump's tariffs on Canada — even as the president escalated the spat this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada by passing a resolution introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York that would rescind the tariffs Trump imposed on the neighbor under a national emergency declaration.\n\nAs tensions with the US's closest trading partner continue to escalate, the measure cleared the chamber 219 to 211, with six Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump and GOP leadership. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against it.\n\nThe vote came a day after Republican leaders failed to block the effort through a procedural maneuver, when three GOP lawmakers sided with Democrats to allow debate to move forward. Trump publicly warned Republicans not to cross him and threatened political retaliation against anyone who voted against tariffs.\n\n\"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social ahead of the vote.\n\nBoth Republicans who defected and Democrats cite economic impacts as their primary reason for opposing tariffs.\n\n\"Today's vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person, Donald J. Trump?\" said Meeks, who authored the resolution, ahead of the vote.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that \"sycophantic Republicans in the House have tried to block us from acting on behalf of the American people\" and that Trump's tariffs were \"causing prices to skyrocket and creating unnecessary uncertainty for American families\".\n\n\"As an old fashioned Conservative I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers,\" said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who voted against tariffs on Canada alongside the Democrats. Bacon will be retiring and won't seek reelection in the midterm.\n\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate. But even if it passes, Trump is expected to veto it, making the effort largely symbolic.\n\nThe congressional rebellion comes as Trump's dispute with Canada intensifies. In January, Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade agreement with China, which offered China a quota for EV exports in exchange for certain agricultural tariffs on Canada being dropped. Trump then threatened to block the opening of a new bridge between Michigan and Ontario, and demanded some ownership of the bridge that Canada paid for.\n\nThough a conversation between Carney and Trump has de-escalated threats on the bridge, it is clear that sentiment toward the US in Canada has soured.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Canadians returning to Canada after traveling in the US took a dive in early 2025 and are down about a quarter from the year before as of November 2025. After Canadian provinces launched a boycott against American alcohol products, US spirits exports to Canada plummeted 85% in the second quarter of 2025 and fell below $10 million in export value, according to the Distilled Spirits Council.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against a House GOP-drafted bill to require people to show documented proof of citizenship before registering to vote and to show ID to cast a ballot, a top priority of the Trump administration.\n\nMurkowski, a prominent centrist Republican, said the Constitution empowers states to manage federal elections for Senate and the House seats, and warned that imposing sweeping federal requirements on local election officials a few months before Election Day would threaten the integrity of the midterm elections.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed. Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that,” Murkowski wrote in a statement posted to social media.\n\n“Once again, I do not support these efforts,” she announced.\n\nShe said the Constitution “clearly” provides states with the authority to regulate the time, place and manner of holding federal elections.\n\nShe argued that “one-size-fits-all” mandates from Washington seldom work in her home state.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said.\n\n“Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this,” Murkowski added.\n\nThe House is expected to pass the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act — or the SAVE America Act — on Wednesday. It has passed a similar version of the legislation, previously known as the SAVE Act, multiple times in the past few years.\n\nMurkowski’s statement comes as Senate conservatives led by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) are pressing Senate GOP leaders to reinterpret the Senate’s filibuster rule to make it easier to pass the law.\n\nLee made a presentation to the Senate GOP conference Tuesday afternoon arguing that Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) should require Democrats actively hold the floor with round-the-clock speeches if they want to block the elections bill.\n\nThune, however, is leery of deploying that strategy, because it could tie up the Senate floor for weeks.\n\nAnd Democrats, if they regain control of Congress and the White House, could also require Republicans to engage in continuous floor debate to block Democratic legislative priorities.\n\nThe SAVE America Act would also require states to conduct reviews of voting rolls to purge inactive voters, something critics say would prevent some infrequent voters from participating due to possibly faulty data.\n\nSenate Democrats have lambasted the SAVE America Act as legislation that would make it tougher for minority and low-income voters to participate in elections.\n\n“Let’s be clear, the SAVE Act is not about securing our elections. It is about suppressing voters. The SAVE Act seeks to disenfranchise millions of American citizens, seize control of our elections, and fan the flames of election skepticism and denialism,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, vowing Democrats will block the legislation.",

    "fullText": "The US military intercepted Mexican cartel drones that breached US airspace, a Trump administration official said on Wednesday, explaining why the government made the rare decision to temporarily restrict flights over El Paso.\n\nThe official told Business Insider that \"Mexican cartel drones breached US airspace,\" adding that the Pentagon \"took action to disable the drones.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration and Pentagon \"have determined there is no threat to commercial travel,\" the official added.\n\nIt's unclear how the US military disabled the cartel drones — whether they were shot down or jammed with electronic warfare technology — or if they were carrying any drugs. The Pentagon declined to provide additional information about the incident.\n\nA social media account for the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, which advises Pentagon leadership on cutting-edge technology, published a photo showing what appears to be a laser destroying a small drone with the caption \"defend the homeland,\" suggesting that directed energy may have been involved in the El Paso incident.\n\nFort Bliss, a major US Army installation in El Paso, could not immediately be reached for comment on the incident.\n\nCartels in Latin America have a history of using drones for drug-related operations, including for smuggling.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that the FAA and Pentagon \"acted swiftly\" to address what he described as a \"cartel drone incursion.\"\n\nThe FAA earlier issued a surprise notice shutting down the airspace above El Paso, a major city in west Texas on the US-Mexico border, and halting all flights up to 18,000 feet for 10 days due to \"special security reasons.\" The restricted area covered a 10-mile radius.\n\nThe restrictions went into effect from 11:30 p.m. MT on Tuesday and were scheduled to last until the same time on February 20. The FAA warned that the US \"may use deadly force\" if an aircraft became \"an imminent security threat.\" It did not offer more details about the situation.\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, whose congressional district includes El Paso, called the FAA's decision \"unprecedented.\"\n\nHowever, the FAA said shortly before 7 a.m. MT on Wednesday that the temporary airspace closure over El Paso had been lifted, adding that \"all flights will resume as normal.\" The agency did not share additional details about the bizarre, hourslong incident, which appeared to catch local lawmakers by surprise.\n\nIn recent years, access to drones has become easier for both state and non-state actors, prompting Western militaries to explore low-cost methods to counter them, including both kinetic and electronic technologies.\n\nThese concerns are top of mind among Western countries following a string of drone incursions across Europe near the end of 2025, during which Russian drones violated the airspace of multiple NATO states and unidentified drones were spotted above critical infrastructure — including airports — in other allied countries.",

    "title": "Trump’s “Board of Peace” Is Part of a Sordid Anti-Palestinian History",
    "description": "James...",
    "fullText": "The refusal of those who have held power over Palestine to acknowledge the grievances and aspirations of its indigenous Arab people isn’t new.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump convened his so-called Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland, a key item on the agenda was to endorse his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s extravagant (and, I might add, detached from reality) plan for a “New Gaza.” The rendering of Kushner’s scheme shows it to be more of a luxury resort for wealthy tourists than the foundation of a just future for the Palestinian victims of Israel’s genocide. But since the raison d’être of the Board of Peace was supposed to be dealing with the aftermath of Israel’s war on Gaza, the conversation, by necessity, had to address the needs of hundreds of thousands of now-homeless Palestinians.\n\nThus, Kushner presented a proposal for a model Palestinian community—the “New Rafah”—he intends to build to house Palestinians in Gaza. The plans for this New Rafah have been circulated since the meeting. Everything is covered: how Gaza’s economy will run, how its educational and health systems will create a new generation of hale and non-ideological Palestinians, and how the “new cities” will be laid out, function, and be governed. And everything has been calculated down to how many teachers, doctors, judges, religious leaders, and laborers will be needed per capita in each community.\n\nIf Kushner were preparing an owner’s manual for a complex piece of machinery or the instructions for installing and operating new software, this plan might seem flawless. But Palestine isn’t a video game, and Palestinians are human beings, not Lego pieces to be assembled, as per the instructions. Like every other people on earth, Palestinians have emotional ties to their homes and families, and memories of the personal and collective injustices they have endured. This failure to consider the fullness of Palestinian humanity is the fatal flaw that will either stop the New Rafah before it begins or cause it to unravel soon afterward.\n\nThe refusal of those who have held power over Palestine to acknowledge the grievances and aspirations of its indigenous Arab people isn’t new. In fact, it has defined their history.\n\nFor example, in 1919, when the British Lord Balfour was presented with the findings of the US-commissioned survey of Arab attitudes, which demonstrated their overwhelming rejection of his intent to grant the Zionist movement a homeland in Palestine, he famously responded, “In Palestine, we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting its inhabitants as to their wishes.… Zionism…[is] of far profounder import than the desire and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who inhabit that ancient land.”\n\nAnd Palestinians were not consulted when the UN drew up grossly unfair maps to partition Palestine into Jewish and Arab states. Those maps gave the Jewish community over one-half of the land (despite its being less than a third of the population). The maps were rejected by Palestinians because more than half a million of them were disenfranchised without any say in the matter. Nor did Palestinians receive support when 650,000 of their brethren were expelled from the newly created Israel in 1948, or when, after the Oslo Accords, neither the UN nor the US would hold Israel accountable for sabotaging the peace plan through settlement expansion, land seizures, the erection of a wall, and the deliberate obstruction of the development of a Palestinian economy.\n\nInstead of acting to support Palestinians as their rights were systematically trampled, the US and other Western states have historically blamed Palestinians, while exonerating themselves and Israel. The result of this century of systematic abuse and denial of rights has been to create a Palestinian community that is justifiably embittered and losing hope. And when they express these feelings, their grievances are dismissed and they are told to just “deal with it”—something that would never be said to, for example, Israelis or the Jewish people.\n\nThis is because US policymakers understand the full humanity of the Jewish community. They understand their history of the losses they have experienced and their need to be respected and heard.\n\nWhat we are seeing in the wake of the genocide in Gaza and in the midst of the state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing and erasure of Palestinian communities in the West Bank is just the same story playing out one more time. Every effort is made to make Israelis feel secure, while Palestinians are expected to lose their homes, families, and memories, and be resigned to being moved about like pawns on a chessboard and be grateful to have the opportunity to live in a model city once they have been properly vetted, biometrically identified, and de-radicalized.\n\nThe bottom line is that Palestinians have never been permitted the human right to make their own decisions. The results have been devastating for both them and the region. The reason behind the wars that have been fought and the aberrant behavior of some elements of Palestinian society can be found in one simple fact: the refusal to allow Palestinians the freedom to determine their future in a manner that recognizes the fullness of their humanity.\n\nWe’ve polled throughout Palestine a number of times in the past few years, and what we’ve found is that Palestinians don’t want to live under the control of Israel or any other external powers. They want the Israeli occupation to end, national unity of all factions in all parts of their country, and to hold a national referendum to elect new leaders and develop a plan for governance that can move them toward freedom and independence. They deserve nothing less.",

    "description": "Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that all...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Parents who owe a significant amount of child support soon could lose their ability to travel internationally as the Trump administration expands and steps up enforcement of a 30-year-old law that allows the federal government to revoke American passports until payments are made, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nWhile passport revocations for unpaid child support of more than $2,500 have been permitted under 1996 federal legislation, the State Department had in the past acted only when someone applied to renew their travel document or sought other consular services. In other words, enforcement depended on the person approaching the department for assistance.\n\nStarting soon, however, the department will begin to revoke passports on its own initiative based on data shared with it by the Health and Human Services Department, according to the U.S. officials familiar with the plan. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the change has not yet been publicly announced.\n\nThe number of people who could be affected was not immediately clear, but it is believed to be in the thousands. Because of the potentially large universe of those owing child support who currently hold passports, the State Department will make the change in tiers, the officials said.\n\nThe first group to be affected will be passport holders who owe more than $100,000 in past-due child support, the officials said. One of the officials said fewer than 500 people meet that threshold and could avoid having their passport revoked if they enter into a payment plan with HHS after being notified of the pending revocation.\n\nThe official acknowledged, though, that if and when the threshold is lowered to a smaller past-due amount, the number of those affected will rise significantly. The official could not say when any further changes would take effect or estimate how many people might then lose their passports.\n\nIn an emailed response to the AP's queries about the change, the State Department said it \"is reviewing options to enforce long-standing law to prevent those owing substantial amounts of child support from neglecting their legal and moral obligations to their children.” It added: “It is simple: deadbeat parents need to pay their child support arrears.”\n\nSince the Passport Denial Program began with the 1996 passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the initiative has taken in nearly $621 million in past-due child support payments, with nine collections of more than $300,000, according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement at the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHHS did not respond to questions about how many people are in arrears.",

On Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he wouldn't allow the bridge to open until Canada compensated the United States \"for everything we have given them.\"\n\nNegotiations would start immediately, Trump wrote. The bridge now remains in a state of limbo. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThere's already one bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor, Ontario.\n\nThe Ambassador Bridge opened in 1929. It's been privately owned by the Moroun family for decades. It reportedly carries about $360 million a day, or about 25% of the value of goods traveling between the US and Canada. It's also limited in its scale, with only four lanes, limited shoulders, and constricted traffic patterns leading up to it in Windsor.\n\nIn 2012, both Canada and Michigan approved the construction of a second bridge, the Gordie Howe. They officially broke ground in October 2018 on the 1.5-mile, six-lane bridge, which will also include a walking and biking path.\n\nThe bridge cost an estimated CA$6.4 billion, or about $4.7 billion. Canada paid for the entire project and plans to recoup its investment through toll revenues.\n\nMichigan will also own a part of the bridge, and the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority will manage operations.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump wrote that the bridge would not open until Canada treated the US with the \"Fairness and Respect that we deserve.\"\n\nThe feud between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has reached a fever pitch. At Davos, the two world leaders exchanged fiery speeches. Canada recently reached a \"preliminary agreement\" for a trade deal with China, and Trump responded with the threat of 100% tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China would allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles to enter the Canadian market at the \"most-favoured-nation tariff rate of 6.1%.\" In exchange, Carney expected China to lower tariffs on Canadian agricultural tariffs.\n\nCanada's deal with China was a point of contention in Trump's post about the bridge. He wrote that China would \"eat Canada alive,\" and said the country would ban hockey and eliminate the Stanley Cup.\n\nTrump wrote that the US \"should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset.\" (Michigan and Canada already jointly own the bridge.)\n\nThere's also the Moroun family, which owns the existing Ambassador Bridge. They've publicly lobbied Trump to stop the new bridge, going so far as to air a commercial in 2018. And on Tuesday, The New York Times reported that Matthew Moroun met with Howard Lutnick, the US Commerce Secretary, about the project. Hours after that reported meeting, Trump posted about the bridge on Truth Social.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. During Trump's first presidency, he issued a statement with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in support of the project.\n\n\"We look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries,\" the two leaders wrote.\n\nCarney said he spoke to Trump on Tuesday morning about the bridge, explaining that Canadians had paid in full for the project and that Michigan already had an ownership stake.\n\nOne of Trump's critiques was that the bridge was not built using American products. Carney said he told Trump the bridge was built with American and Canadian workers and steel from both the US and Canada.\n\n\"It was a positive conversation,\" Carney said.\n\nMichigan, the second party in the agreement with Canada, doesn't seem thrilled, either. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said that she was in communication with Trump's staff, and that the bridge was a \"really important part of our economy.\"\n\nAnd they may not wait for Trump's approval. Whitmer's press secretary said on Tuesday that the bridge would open \"one way or another.\"",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson failed to reinstate a ban on lawmakers’ ability to challenge President Donald Trump’s tariffs when three Republicans crossed party lines to vote with Democrats.\n\nThe House sank a procedural vote on Tuesday that contained language blocking votes in the chamber that object to Trump’s tariffs through July. The move opens the door for Democrats to move forward with forcing votes to repeal Trump’s tariffs, in a blow to the administration.\n\nWith razor-thin margins in the House, three Republicans – GOP Reps. Thomas Massie, Don Bacon and Kevin Kiley – were enough to sink the vote. Johnson can only afford to lose one Republican vote to advance legislation with his current margin.\n\nThe Senate has passed at least three resolutions rebuking Trump’s tariffs, but routinely ran into resistance in the House where members were blocked from forcing votes on the matter.\n\nBacon said in a statement posted to X, “I don’t like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs.”\n\nThe Nebraska congressman went on to say, “tariffs have been a ‘net negative’ for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying. Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It’s time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility.”\n\nGOP leaders had argued that lawmakers should allow the Supreme Court time to weigh in.\n\nSpeaker Johnson acknowledged the challenges he faces holding together his razor-thin majority after the failed vote.\n\n“Look, this is life with a small majority. I mean, you know, I need unanimity every day, and we didn’t get it tonight,” he told reporters.\n\n“The vast majority of the House Republicans agree wholeheartedly with the president, and we’re going to give him the latitude to continue his trade policy,” he said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House says President Donald Trump has the right to amend a permit for a new bridge between Canada and Michigan, prolonging the latest dispute between the U.S. and its northern neighbor hours after its prime minister signaled there could be a detente.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge, which would connect Ontario and Michigan and would be a vital economic artery between the two countries, is scheduled to open in early 2026. But Trump has now threatened to block the bridge from being opened, calling for Canada to agree to a litany of unspecified demands as the two nations prepare to renegotiate a sprawling trade pact later this year.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said earlier Tuesday that he spoke with Trump and expressed confidence that the spat would be resolved. But a White House official later Tuesday said the ownership structure of the bridge remains unacceptable for the U.S. president.\n\nCanada paid for the bridge, named after a Canadian-born Detroit Red Wings hockey star. Construction has been underway since 2018.\n\nThe official said that all international infrastructure projects require a presidential permit, and that Trump would be within his right to amend that permit. The person was granted anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly.\n\n“The fact that Canada will control what crosses the Gordie Howe Bridge and owns the land on both sides is unacceptable to the president,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “It’s also unacceptable that more of this bridge isn’t being built with more American-made materials.”\n\nThe new fight over the bridge is the latest volley in an increasingly sour relationship between the United States and Canada, particularly over trade policy. Trump has also mused publicly about acquiring Canada as the 51st U.S. state, much to the dismay of Canadians.\n\nFollowing his conversation with Trump, Carney said “this is going to be resolved” and noted that he told the U.S. president that the Canadian and Michigan governments shared ownership of the bridge. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office has also emphasized that the bridge will be operated under a joint ownership agreement between the state and Canada, even though the Canadian government paid for it.\n\nCarney also added that U.S. steel was used in the project, which also employed U.S. workers. According to Carney, Trump told him he’ll ask the U.S. ambassador to Canada, former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra, to “play a role in smoothing the conversation in and around the bridge.”\n\nHoekstra did not return an immediate request for comment.\n\n“I look forward to it opening and what is particularly important is the commerce and the tourism of Canadians and Americans that go across that bridge,” Carney said.\n\nThe project was negotiated by former Michigan Republican Gov. Rick Snyder and paid for by the Canadian government to help ease congestion over the existing Ambassador Bridge and Detroit-Windsor tunnel.\n\nSnyder wrote in an op-ed in The Detroit News on Tuesday that Trump was wrong in asserting that Canada owns both the U.S.- and Canadian sides of the Gordie Howe bridge.\n\n“Canada and the state of Michigan are 50/50 owners of the new bridge,\" Snyder wrote. “Canada was wonderful and financed the entire bridge. They will get repaid with interest from the tolls. Michigan and the United States got their half-ownership with no investment.”\n\nThe former governor also emphasized that parts of the bridge construction were exempt from “Buy America” requirements for its steel because half of the project was outside the U.S. and subsequently, U.S. law should not apply to them.\n\n“President Trump, I would encourage you to challenge your advisers and the sources for your post to correct the information they have provided,” Snyder wrote in the op-ed. He acknowledged some trade issues with Canada, but “picking this bridge as the leverage point doesn’t seem to make the most sense given your other tools.\"",

    "fullText": "Moderate House Republicans worried about this year’s midterm elections appear ready to finally break with President Donald Trump over his signature economic policy.\n\nIn a bid to protect Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly introduced procedural rules banning members from bringing up resolutions challenging the president’s crushing tariffs on products from dozens of U.S. trading partners.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson planned to ask the House to extend the ban through August. But this time, key Republicans signaled they would likely vote against the measure, Punchbowl reported.\n\n“American consumers pay the tariffs and thus it is a big tax,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told the outlet. “I support giving these authorities back to Congress.”\n\nRep. Kevin Kiley of California also told Punchbowl that he had “made it clear” he was not in favor of extending the blockade.\n\nWith full attendance, two Republican defectors would be enough to sink Johnson’s proposed extension, opening the door to a flood of Democratic resolutions challenging the increasingly unpopular tariffs.\n\nThe vote is likely to be close, as some Republicans are still holding out hope the Supreme Court will strike down the tariffs, easing voters’ concerns while sparing them a confrontation with the president, according to Punchbowl.\n\nThe duties are a form of import tax paid by American companies, which must either eat the additional costs or pass them along to consumers.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed the bulk of the costs fall on foreign producers and middlemen, when in fact Americans “pay one way or the other—via higher prices or less choice,” the opinion editors of the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal wrote last week.\n\nTrump trade adviser Peter Navarro acknowledged in December that U.S. manufacturing was down thanks to the tariffs, which have also contributed to higher prices and led to intense trade volatility.\n\nTariffs were also at the center of an international scandal last month after the president threatened to impose duties on products from countries that opposed his efforts to seize Greenland, an autonomous region of a fellow NATO country, Denmark.\n\nHe ultimately dropped the threat after NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte talked him down during a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nIf Johnson’s procedural vote fails, Democrats are likely to force votes as early as this week on resolutions to overturn Trump’s tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada, followed by resolutions aimed at tariffs on Brazilian products and products from other global trade partners.\n\nThe Canada vote in particular would be a difficult one for Republicans and would require the White House’s intervention, Johnson told Puck.\n\nWhile Trump could ultimately veto any resolution reining in his trade wars, a rebuke from Congress would nevertheless be politically damaging.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposes President Trump's SAVE Act, an election bill requiring proof of citizenship to vote nationwide, saying states run elections.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska on Tuesday became the first Republican senator to speak out against the SAVE Act, a sweeping election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to vote nationwide.\n\nIn doing so, she reminded her colleagues that they roundly claimed to oppose new federal election laws as recently as Joe Biden’s presidency.\n\n“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Murkowski said in a statement. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”\n\n“Not only does the U.S. Constitution clearly provide states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections, but one-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska,” she added.\n\nUnder current law, all U.S. voters must attest under oath that they are citizens, with criminal penalties for lying. Beyond that, states can set their own rules.\n\nThe SAVE Act would bar states from registering people to vote unless they provide documents or evidence proving U.S. citizenship. It would also require all Americans to present ID when they go to vote.\n\nThe legislation, introduced by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, has 48 GOP co-sponsors, and Trump has repeatedly called on Congress to pass it in recent days. Even if it gains a majority of the Senate, it is subject to the 60-vote threshold, and Democrats have vowed to block it.\n\nWhile Trump and other SAVE Act backers say it’s designed to protect election integrity, Murkowski said it would do the opposite.\n\n“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she said. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, Democrats passed the For the People Act through the House, seeking to establish an aggressive set of federal rules to bolster voting rights and ban partisan gerrymandering. A majority of senators supported a slimmed-down version, called the Freedom to Vote Act, but it died because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n\nAt the time, Senate Republicans vehemently opposed the measure, saying election rules must be left to states.\n\n“This is not a federal issue,” McConnell told reporters in January 2022 when the bill came before the Senate. “It ought to be left to the states. There’s nothing broken around the country. The system upheld very well during an intense stress during the latter part of the previous Congress. There’s no rational basis for federalizing this election, and, therefore, there’s no point in having a debate in the U.S. Senate about something we ought not do.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — An annual meeting of the nation’s governors that has long served as a rare bipartisan gathering is unraveling after President Donald Trump excluded Democratic governors from White House events.\n\nThe National Governors Association said it will no longer hold a formal meeting with Trump when governors are scheduled to convene in Washington later this month, after the White House planned to invite only Republican governors. On Tuesday, 18 Democratic governors also announced they would boycott a traditional dinner at the White House.\n\n“If the reports are true that not all governors are invited to these events, which have historically been productive and bipartisan opportunities for collaboration, we will not be attending the White House dinner this year,” the group wrote. “Democratic governors remain united and will never stop fighting to protect and make life better for people in our states.”\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican and the chairman of the NGA, said in a letter Monday to fellow governors obtained by The Associated Press that the White House intends to limit invitations to the association’s annual business meeting, scheduled for February 20, to Republican governors only.\n\n“Because NGA’s mission is to represent all 55 governors, the Association is no longer serving as the facilitator for that event, and it is no longer included in our official program,” Stitt wrote.\n\nThe NGA is scheduled to meet in Washington from Feb. 19-21. Representatives for Stitt, the White House and the NGA didn't immediately comment on the letter.\n\nBrandon Tatum, the NGA's CEO, said in a statement last week that the White House meeting is an “important tradition” and said the organization was “disappointed in the administration's decision to make it a partisan occasion this year.”\n\nThe governors group is one of the few remaining venues where political leaders from both major parties gather to discuss the top issues facing their communities. In his letter, Stitt encouraged governors to unite around common goals.\n\n“We cannot allow one divisive action to achieve its goal of dividing us,” he wrote. “The solution is not to respond in kind, but to rise above and to remain focused on our shared duty to the people we serve. America’s governors have always been models of pragmatic leadership, and that example is most important when Washington grows distracted by politics.”\n\nSigns of partisan tensions emerged at the White House meeting last year, when Trump and Maine's Gov. Janet Mills traded barbs.\n\nTrump singled out the Democratic governor over his push to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ and women’s sports, threatening to withhold federal funding from the state if she did not comply. Mills responded, “We’ll see you in court.”\n\nTrump then predicted that Mills’ political career would be over for opposing the order. She is now running for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe back and forth had a lasting impact on last year’s conference and some Democratic governors did not renew their dues last year to the bipartisan group.\n\nPeoples reported from New York.",

    "description": "Donations get pushed through a nonprofit intermediary, which stands to see major profits as a result",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s plan to have private donors fund his new $400 million White House ballroom may cost him the entire project, as a federal judge will soon decide whether the administration is allowed to rely on fundraising to bypass congressional approval.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ricard Leon says he may rule this month on a lawsuit filed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in December to halt the ballroom’s construction, according to the Washington Post.\n\nTrump has argued that using private donations to pay for the project keeps the burden off taxpayers, but critics say the plan highlights a lack of transparency about how the expansion is being funded.\n\nDemocrats and watchdog groups have raised questions about the arrangement, which relies on donations from big corporations and businesses. The donations are then routed through a nonprofit intermediary, which also profits, having received millions of dollars in fees, according to the Post.\n\nThe Trump administration has already found a lengthy list of donors, including Big Tech giants Amazon, Apple, Google, HP and Microsoft — as well as other well-known companies like Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Palantir Technologies and T-Mobile.\n\nMost of the donors have declined to say how much they’ve given. However, the watchdog group CREW (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington) says at least 22 companies involved in the project failed to disclose their donations in lobbying filings.\n\nDuring a hearing for the lawsuit brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation held in January, Leon shared his reservations about proceeding without congressional approval. He also questioned whether Trump possessed the statutory power to dismantle the East Wing and build a ballroom in its place without explicit oversight or authorization from Congress.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, is urging the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit managing the project’s donations, to clarify its role and share information about the donations it has received.\n\nThe organization declined to provide details to the Post about the gifts, but said it collects between 2 and 2.5 percent of each donation as part of a management fee. A spokesperson said the fee is standard practice.\n\nThe White House has declined to specify how much money has been raised for the project, which has doubled in cost from its initial estimate of $200 million last summer.\n\n“President Trump is generously donating his time and resources to build a beautiful White House ballroom, a project which past presidents only dreamed about,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said. “Since announcing this historic plan, the White House has been inundated with calls from generous Americans and American companies wishing to contribute.”\n\nIn October, Trump hosted an opulent gala dinner for some of his sponsors in the East Room of the White House — which coincided with the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days.\n\nSoon after plans to replace the East Wing with a new ballroom were announced, demolition began without any extensive public review process. The ballroom is projected to be approximately 90,000 square feet, and the attached “New East Wing” complex will include a new office for the First Lady, a movie theater and commercial kitchen.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit filed in December says.\n\nHowever, in December Leon declined to immediately pause construction of the project, and Trump’s Department of Justice is moving to ensure that doesn’t change.\n\nA DOJ filing asked a federal judge overseeing the lawsuit to stay any injunction on the construction over alleged “national security” concerns, ABC News reported.\n\n\"[A]s the Secret Service attested, halting construction would imperil the President and others who live and work in the White House,\" the administration argues in the filing.\n\nThe Trump administration said it will also be submitting a second classified statement from the Secret Service to further support its argument that stopping construction at the site will \"endanger national security and therefore impair the public interest.\"\n\nThe filing claims that leaving the project incomplete would be a risk to national security. The DOJ filing comes after Judge Leon first made it clear he was skeptical of Trump’s claim that he could use private donations to fund the ballroom’s construction.",

    "description": "Large proportion worked at Columbia University, which had its grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.",
    "fullText": "France announced late last week that it would be awarding funds to 46 scientists as part of a high-profile initiative to recruit foreign researchers to the country with the promise of greater academic freedom. Almost all of them were previously at US institutions.\n\nThe more than €30-million Choose France for Science initiative, launched last April, is just one of a slew of European initiatives that aim to bring in research talent disaffected by changes elsewhere. These include the European Union's Choose Europe initiative, which is currently supported by nearly €900 million (US$1.1 billion) in research funding. The French programme will see 41 of the 46 recruits relocate to France from the United States. Eight of these researchers worked at Columbia University in New York City, which last year saw hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of its research grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe awardees include Zhongkai Tao, a mathematician studying the structures of waves and matter in physics. Previously at the University of California, Berkeley, Tao has now taken up his grant at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques or IHES) in Paris. Astrophysicist Kartik Sheth, who was associate chief scientist at NASA until he was fired by the agency during mass layoffs last year, has also been funded by the initiative. He will take up a three-year position at Aix-Marseille University in France.\n\nUnder Trump’s second presidency, US researchers have experienced grant cuts, the dismantling of science-funding agencies and increased federal control over universities. US foreign aid and awards to international collaborators have also been terminated. When announcing the call last year, Élisabeth Borne, then French minister for higher education and research, said that France would offer a “refuge” to researchers as “science and research face unprecedented threats worldwide”.\n\nThe high proportion of US scientists among those recruited by the programme shows that “enthusiasm and morale for doing science is low” in the United States, says Sharon Milgram, who led early-career researcher training and education programmes at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for nearly 20 years, until she retired in December.\n\nYet a few dozen vacating scientists are unlikely to make a large dent at US academic institutions, which altogether have more than 1.5 million faculty members, she says. France and other countries hoping to lure US scientists face an uphill battle: funders such as the NIH, with their multibillion-dollar budgets, are irreplaceable, Milgram adds. Tens of thousands of scientists, rather than dozens, would need to relocate for it to have a big long-term impact on US science, she says.\n\nColumbia University, which had most of its grants reinstated and unfrozen after the institution agreed to pay US$200 million to settle claims that it had failed to combat campus antisemitism, did not respond to Nature’s queries about its researchers leaving the institution.\n\nOf the 46 awardees, 19 are US nationals, 13 are French and 8 are originally from other European nations. The largest share are researchers studying climate, biodiversity and sustainable societies, according to the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The ministry declined to identify the 46 awardees, citing safety reasons.\n\nBut it did reveal that almost half of the awardees are headed to higher-education institutions in and around Paris. And 12 are going to Aix-Marseille University, which launched its own ‘Safe Place for Science’ initiative, worth about €15 million (US$17.9 million). The university said that the programme was launched “in a context where some scientists in the United States may feel threatened or hindered in their research”.\n\nAmong them is Alka Patel, a historian of art and architecture, previously at the University of California Irvine.\n\nMeanwhile, Tao says he decided to move to France because the IHES is “a world-leading institute of mathematics” and he will be surrounded in Paris by a strong maths community. “Certainly, the Choose France funding shows that the French government supports researchers from all over the world,” he adds. With the funding, Tao says that he will establish a research group and study uncertainty principles and geometric spectral theory.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00405-2\n\nEpstein files reveal deeper ties to scientists than previously known\n\nUS grant applications surge at prestigious European research agency\n\nIs UK science in jeopardy?

    "description": "France's Dassault Aviation is currently working on the F5 standard Rafale fighter, also known as the Super Dassault Rafale. How will it compare to the F-35?",
    "fullText": "Whenever there's a discussion around fighter jets, it usually veers towards U.S., Russian, and Chinese-made planes. These include usual suspects like the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning, Russia's Sukhoi Su-57, and the Chinese J-20. While these are advanced planes without an iota of doubt, what most people tend to forget about is the Dassault Rafale. A fourth generation multirole fighter jet designed and developed by French aviation major Dassault, the Rafale is widely thought to be one of the most advanced and formidable fighter jets to ever exist.\n\nOperational since 2004, more than 300 Rafales have been manufactured and have been deployed around the world. Dassault has regularly updated the Rafale, starting with the F1 standard Rafale in 2004, the F2 standard Rafale in 2006, and the F3 standard Rafale developed in 2008. In 2018, Dassault debuted the F-3R Standard Rafale, which was followed by the newest generation of the fighter, the F4 standard Rafale, along with the F4.1 and 4.2 sub-variants.\n\nGiven that Dassault has steadily improved and added newer capabilities to the Rafale over the years, it's not surprising that the company has planned further upgrades to the fighter to keep it operational and relevant well into the 2060s. Dassault's next major upgrade path for the Rafale is the Rafale F5 Standard, which is also unofficially dubbed by many as the Super Dassault Rafale.\n\nPredictably the upcoming Rafale variant will be compared against America's F-35. However, most aviation enthusiasts would know that these two fighter jets cannot be directly compared. The F-35 and the Rafale F5 are not only built for different purposes, they also belong to two entirely different generations of fighter jets.\n\nBefore comparing the Super Dassault Rafale and the F-35, it is important to note that only one of these planes is in service today: the F-35 Lightning. We have already discussed how the Rafale F5 Standard is still in its developmental stages, and per current projections, this version will only enter service in 2030 or later.\n\nMoving on to the capabilities of both planes, the biggest advantage the F-35 has over the Rafale F5 is that it is based on a newer and more advanced platform. The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter, built from the ground up as a stealth aircraft. It stands out from the current generation of multirole fighters in several ways, and it is widely considered to be the most advanced fighter jet in existence today.\n\nThe Rafale, on the other hand, started life as a fourth-generation fighter, and following several upgrades, it is now classified as a 4.5 or 4.5+ generation aircraft. While it cannot match the F-35 in terms of stealth, the Rafale has excellent electronic warfare capabilities, it can carry a larger number of weapons in typical combat missions, and is cheaper to buy and operate. The Super Dassault Rafale is also slated to receive support for UCAS (Unmanned Combat Air System) drones, a capability that the U.S. is also currently working on.\n\nIn simpler words, while the Super Dassault Rafale will be a formidable, advanced 4.5-generation multirole fighter jet, it falls short of the F-35 in several areas, simply based on fact that the F-35 is a newer-generation fighter. A more direct competitor to the F-35 would be the upcoming sixth-gen fighters; including Europe's Future Combat Air System (FCAS), as well as the U.S.' own, in-development GCAP fighters.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it’s waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organization the Trump administration intends to pay and when the money will arrive.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.\n\nThe U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations confirmed that U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears in a matter of weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time,” and the U.N.’s controller also has been in touch with U.S. officials.\n\n”We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.\n\nGuterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the U.N.'s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and it has withdrawn from U.N. organizations, including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO, while pulling funding from dozens of others.\n\nU.N. officials have said 95% of the arrears to the U.N.’s regular budget is from the United States.\n\nThe country second on the list for not paying its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela, which owes $38 million, the U.N. official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before the U.S. military raid in January that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro, has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.\n\nNearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb. 8 due date.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE’s lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly.\n\nThe Democrats’ statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.”\n\nThune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.”\n\nBut coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAnd many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back.\n\n“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers.\n\nDemocrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nAmong other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepublicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks.\n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.”\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.”\n\n“The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said.\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions.\n\n“If there’s additional time that’s needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said.\n\nMany Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations.\n\n“The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday.",

    "description": "What happened between them?",
    "fullText": "President Trump is notorious for his emotional ups and downs and for turning on people on a dime. So, it’s not surprising that someone like Jeff Bezos would be trying hard to stay in the President’s good graces. This entire presidency, we’ve seen business leaders from all sides of the political aisle try to integrate themselves with Trump, because that’s beneficial for their business. Business first, morals later. Or something.\n\nNow, there are reports that the recent layoffs at the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, might have had something to do with Trump. Martin Baron, former executive editor of the Post, told Jen Psaki on “The Briefing” that the layoffs were related to Trump.\n\nBad Bunny's Real Feelings About Trump Resurface as the President Calls His Super Bowl Performance 'Disgusting' & the 'Worst Ever'\n\nGreen Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a 'Terrible Choice'\n\nAccording to Barron, when he joined the Washington Post in 2013, “It was a great news organization then,” even if “it had faced many challenges.\n\n“[Bezos] acquired the paper about a year after I had been there. He invested. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the Post. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the press in this country,” he said, adding that the paper “grew under the ownership” of Bezos.\n\nBut he was clear that the layoffs “represent a turn back.”\n\n“It suggests that this newspaper, with a deep heritage and historically high ambitions, is going to retreat,” he explained. “And it’s a terrible thing to see a news organization that’s been so important to the history of this country retreat the way that this newspaper is doing.”\n\nAll of this, Baron said, can be traced back to Trump. “I explain it by saying the words ‘Donald Trump.’ That’s what happened.”\n\n“Trump came into office again,” Baron said. “He had promised vengeance against his perceived political enemies. Jeff Bezos was seen as a political enemy by Donald Trump for one reason and one reason only, and that was the coverage of the Washington Post.”\n\nAnd that coverage was, of course, not always positive. Baron was clear that he believed Bezos feared repercussions for him and his business due to the Washington Post’s reporting.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House, Baron said he believed Bezos was afraid the administration would target him and his other businesses for the Post’s journalism. “And so he has sought to navigate this administration during the second term,” Baron explained. And that apparently means scaling back the negative coverage of Trump and moving more towards the center, something Baron was very critical of. This is also something that has been pointed out by many others as over 300 journalists were fired from the Washington Post in recent days, with the entirety of the books and sports section and most of its international coverage being shut down.\n\n“This is a newspaper that has prided itself on its independence, and the behavior of Jeff Bezos has suggested to the readers that he is not independent at all,” Baron said. “He’s actually dependent — dependent on Donald Trump.”\n\nNot a good sign for one of the most important newspapers in the country, one whose logline is: Democracy Dies in Darkness.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul would place a lower student-loan limit on certain advanced degrees, including nursing.",
    "fullText": "Nursing programs are taking center stage in the public conversation on President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul.\n\nPublic comment on the Department of Education's proposed student-loan changes has been open for one week, giving anyone the opportunity to submit feedback. Those changes include new income-driven repayment plans, updates to the handling of defaulted student loans, and new borrowing caps for advanced programs.\n\nThe new borrowing caps, in particular, have sparked conversation and concern among advocates, lawmakers, and students. The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is \"fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as \"fairness and respect.\"\n\n\"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies. In January, Trump also warned that he could impose a 50% tariff on aircraft manufactured in Canada and revoke certification for newly produced planes.\n\nThe White House and the Ontario Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief.\n\nIn a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits.\n\n“Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching.\n\nThe administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled.\n\n“The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren's office.\n\nA spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time.\n\nThe bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nAnother roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThe bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year.\n\nThere's also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%.\n\nThe independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate.\n\nThe GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management.\n\nMark Paoletta, the bureau's chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.",

For a month beginning Feb. 9, Cuba is suspending oil supplies to foreign airlines to address the energy crisis, CNBC reported.\n\nThis means airlines including American Airlines, Air Canada, and Air France, which run multiple flights into the country, will need to either carry enough backup jet fuel or arrange for refueling stops in nearby Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic or Jamaica.\n\nThe move affects both the central Havana Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) and smaller airports in Cuban cities including Varadero, Holguín, Manzanillo, and Santa Clara.\n\nWhile Mexico had previously attempted to boost oil supplies to Cuba, the threat of tariffs has led to it pulling back. The humanitarian situation, reported by Reuters, has reached critical levels, where many portions of the country are left without power.\n\nCanadian national airline Air Canada has made major cutbacks of its Cuba service and has run primarily non-revenue flights out of the country to get stranded travelers back home.\n\nAir France has confirmed to French news service AFP that it will reroute its refueling stops to other countries in the Caribbean.\n\n\"We will operate as scheduled out of Cuba, carrying passengers to Canada,\" an Air Canada airline representative said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation to ensure safe and reliable operations for our passengers and crew and will share more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines, which at this time of the year runs more than 70 weekly flights to Cuban cities like Havana and Holguín from Miami International (MIA), is another airline that could see significant disruption by the Cuban NOTAM that prevents foreign carrier refueling.\n\nAirline to launch unusual new flight to Cayman Islands from the U.S.\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nUnexpected country is most luxurious travel destination for 2026\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions from House lawmakers in a deposition Monday, but indicated that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she was willing to testify that neither he nor former President Bill Clinton had done anything wrong in their relationships with Epstein.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she’s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating. She’s come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.\n\nAmid a reckoning over Epstein's abuse that has spilled into nations around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. So far, the revelations have shown how both Trump and Clinton spent time with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the closed-door deposition Monday, an attorney for Maxwell told lawmakers that if Trump granted her clemency, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting.\n\nDemocrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.\n\n“It’s very clear she’s campaigning for clemency,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, described Maxwell’s demeanor during the short video call as “robotic” and “unrepentant.”\n\nTrump has not ruled out granting Maxwell clemency, but Republican pushback to that notion quickly rose after Maxwell made the appeal.\n\n“NO CLEMENCY. You comply or face punishment,” Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, wrote on social media. “You deserve JUSTICE for what you did you monster.”\n\nMaxwell has been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as “substantial new evidence” that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.\n\nMaxwell's attorney cited that petition as he told lawmakers she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, told reporters that it was “very disappointing” that Maxwell declined to participate in the deposition.\n\nFamily members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her “a bystander” to Epstein's abuse.\n\n“You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,” Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nComer had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn't answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.\n\nComer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.\n\nMeanwhile, several lawmakers also planned on Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the Department of Justice has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touted the supposed strength of America on Super Bowl Sunday—as he watched the game from the comfort of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n“Enjoy the Super Bowl, America! Our Country is stronger, bigger, and better than ever before and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” he wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday.\n\nTrump, who has been booed at myriad sporting events—including last year’s Super Bowl—wasn’t at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Instead, he attended a watch party at his private Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe president had previously said he wanted to attend the game but that it was “just too far away.”\n\n“I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter,” he added.\n\nBut Zeteo learned that Trump’s officials and advisers were privately concerned about Trump getting booed at the biggest television event of the year. Last year’s event drew an estimated 127.7 million viewers, Nielsen reported, with similar numbers expected this year.\n\nViral clips of the president being loudly booed by tens of thousands of spectators would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told the outlet.\n\nBut even from thousands of miles away, the president still managed to court controversy as the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots, 29-13.\n\nFor months, MAGA had been in full-on meltdown mode over the NFL’s choice of Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, 31, to headline the Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\nBorn Benito Martinez Ocasio, Bad Bunny was Spotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025 and made history at this year’s Grammy Awards when he won album of the year for his Spanish-language Debí Tirar Mas Fotos.\n\nHis halftime performance pulled from the Debí Tirar Mas Fotos world tour and celebrated Latin American culture beneath a billboard that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”\n\nTrump called the performance a “slap in the face to our country.”\n\n“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” he complained in a Truth Social post. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence.”\n\nBut unlike his speech at the Grammy’s, Bad Bunny’s performance didn’t explicitly denounce the president’s immigration policy.\n\nInstead, he invited the audience to rejoice in the pan-American culture the Trump administration has demonized and even drove home his point about love and unity with an actual wedding.\n\nSome of the president’s own supporters worried about him taking such an aggressive stand against the show, considering the administration is hemorrhaging support among Latinos, Politico reported.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

The 30-second video opens with a sweeping shot of a football stadium as Air Force One passes overhead, prompting astonished reactions from two digitally rendered fans wearing Patriots and Seahawks gear. “We don’t do subtle,” the narrator says at the outset. The scene then shifts inside the aircraft, where a voice announces that the plane is “flying over the Gulf of America.” A screeching eagle sound effect follows as the video rapidly transitions to the White House, cutting through a montage of President Donald Trump signing executive orders. “We bet on ourselves and don’t apologize for winning,” the narrator continues.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump's bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn't back the U.S. president's heightened crackdown on immigrants.\n\n“I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,\" said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage.\n\nGu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he's going through.\n\n“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod.\n\nHess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n\nThe next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess's friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction.\n\n“My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday.\n\n\"I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.”\n\nOther American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression.\n\n“I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.”\n\nTeammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.\"\n\n“It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said.\n\nGu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports.\n\n“I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,\" she said. \"It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Bad Bunny celebrated Puerto Rico at the 2026 Super Bowl, where he became the first Spanish-speaking solo artist to headline the halftime show. Trump hated it.",
    "fullText": "When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric.\n\nIt's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism.\n\nNods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled \"La Marqueta\" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice). While performing \"El Apagón,\" a song about the frequent blackouts and infrastructure issues affecting Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny brought this symbolism to the forefront, waving the Puerto Rican flag.\n\nHe also proclaimed in English, \"God bless America,\" and brandished a football printed with the phrase \"Together, We Are America.\" He added in Spanish, \"We're still here.\" (Puerto Rico is a US territory, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)\n\nIt was a stark and knowing contrast to the Latinophobia and anti-immigrant messaging hawked by the Trump administration. So much so that President Donald Trump complained online about Bad Bunny's performance and his choice to sing primarily in Spanish.\n\n\"The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\"\n\nFor those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say \"ICE out\" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead.\n\nBad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements.\n\nBeyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, \"Formation.\" In the midst of Trump's first presidential campaign, Beyoncé and her backup dancers wore outfits that channeled the Black Panther Party, an organization formed amid the '60s Civil Rights Movement that fought for Black liberation.\n\nThe song itself isn't explicitly political. But as a celebration of identity and legacy that features lyrics about Beyoncé's parents, her daughter, and her features (\"I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils\"), Beyoncé performing it — with visual references to the song's themes in her and her dancers' costumes, to boot — was innately political.\n\nIt's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word \"Feminist\" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang \"Votin' out 45, don't get out of line\" on her 2022 album \"Renaissance,\" referring to Trump as the 45th president. But when the NFL hosts musicians for the night, they've lately preferred make their statements symbolic rather than overt.\n\nLast year, Kendrick Lamar followed suit during his own Super Bowl halftime show, outfitting himself and his dancers in red, white, and blue. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict?\n\nBad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. For the finale, he was surrounded by backup dancers, band members, and other performers holding flags from around the world; when he proclaimed \"God bless America,\" he listed out all the countries in both North and South America.\n\nBad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

    "fullText": "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) sent a searing letter in which he stated his intention to ask Ghislaine Maxwell if she or Jeffrey Epstein ever procured “underage girls” for President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-TN) announced last month that Maxwell would be deposed by the committee, and that deposition is scheduled for this Monday.\n\nBut on Sunday, Maxwell’s attorney made clear she intends to plead the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCongressman Khanna, the ranking member on the committee, responded with a searing letter to Comer listing the questions he planned to ask Maxwell — including a few loaded ones about Trump:\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC\n\nIt is my understanding that Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell intends to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and decline to answer all substantive questions at her upcoming deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThis position appears inconsistent with Ms. Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter.\n\nI understand that Ms. Maxwell intends to assert this privilege on a “blanket basis” by reading a prepared statement at the outset of the deposition and refusing to permit Members to question her individually through counsel, rather than invoking the privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n\nAccordingly, for the sake of clarity, I am submitting in this letter the questions I intend to ask at Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and request confirmation from the Chair as to whether she intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to the following questions:\n\n1. On December 17, 2025, you filed a habeas corpus petition stating that “four named co-conspirators” and 25 men who entered into secret settlements were not indicted as part of the investigation. Is that statement accurate?\n\n2. Who are the four co-conspirators and the 25 men, other than Jeffrey Epstein, who sexually abused minors at Epstein’s island, his New Mexico ranch, or his New York residence, and why do you believe they were not indicted?\n\n3. What information, evidence, or personal knowledge do you have regarding why these individuals were not charged or prosecuted by federal authorities?\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\n6.

It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after Bad Bunny's performance.\n\nThe president said, \"nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\" The Grammy award-winning singer has committed to singing only in Spanish.\n\n\"There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe president also called the show \"just a 'slap in the face' to our Country.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the White House issued a statement from Trump about the Super Bowl, in which the president said he sent his \"best wishes to the athletes and coaches of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks as they take the field.\" The message did not reference the halftime show.\n\nBad Bunny performed at Super Bowl LX on Sunday just one week after winning three Grammys, including album of the year.\n\nBad Bunny did not mention ICE during his performance, focusing instead on inclusion. His backup dancers ran out with flags of the countries in North and South America.\n\nHe also performed in front of a billboard with the words: \"THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.\" During his set, he held up a football with the words \"TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA\" on it.\n\nThe singer made headlines last week for saying \"ICE Out\" during an acceptance speech at the Grammys, a statement that placed him, a celebrity of Puerto Rican heritage, in direct opposition to the president.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "description": "Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "Top House Democrat says president’s suggestion for Republicans to ‘take over’ elections really means ‘steal it’",
    "fullText": "Democrats will stop Donald Trump from trying to steal this year’s midterm elections, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the US House of Representatives said on Sunday.\n\nJeffries comments come amid widespread concern after Trump said Republicans should “take over the voting”. The US constitution gives states the power to set election rules and says Congress can pass laws to set requirements for federal elections. The constitution gives the president no authority over how elections are run.\n\n“What Donald Trump wants to do is try and nationalize the election – translation: steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He added that Democrats so far had successfully blocked Trump’s efforts to federalize the national guard countered a nationwide push by Republicans to redraw congressional district boundaries to their advantage.\n\n“This is going to be a free and fair election,” Jeffries said. It “is going to be conducted like every other election where states and localities have the ability to administer the laws”.\n\nThe Trump administration for months has been sowing doubt about the integrity of this year’s midterm elections by filing lawsuits against states suggesting they are improperly maintaining their voter rolls. The FBI also undertook an unprecedented raid of the election office in Fulton county, Georgia, last month, seizing ballots and other voter information related to the 2020 election. Allegations of fraud have been debunked repeatedly in Fulton county, yet Trump has continued to repeat false claims about the county.\n\nLater in his interview on CNN, Jeffries condemned Trump’s refusal to apologize for a racist post on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House deleted the post on Friday amid widespread outcry and said a staffer was responsible for posting it.\n\n“He definitively needs to apologize. It was a disgusting video and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country,” Jeffries said. “Democrats and even a handful of Republicans who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president’s malignant, bottom-feeder-like behavior.”\n\nSenator Adam Schiff of California also said it was clear Trump was trying to interfere in the election and also questioned why Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was at the Fulton county raid.\n\n “He fully intends to try to subvert the elections. He will do everything he can to suppress the vote. And if he loses the vote, and I think the Republicans now expect they’ll get a real drubbing in the midterms, he’s prepared to try to take some kind of action to overturn the result. And we really shouldn’t question that,” Schiff said during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “I think all of this is intended to send a message. And the message is: ‘We will not tolerate or accept an election that we lose.’”",

    "fullText": "In November, approval of Trump’s presidency fell to a new low in his second term, with 36% approving and 60% disapproving. Among all items on the current agenda, his Ukraine policy attracts the least support, with only 31% approving. It ranks lowest even among Republicans, with approval at just 67%, compared with 85% approval for Trump’s foreign policy overall. At the same time, the share of Americans who believe that US assistance to Ukraine is insufficient has reached a wartime high of 46%.\n\nA survey by the Ronald Reagan Institute focused on national security shows that the foreign policy views of the average American largely remain within the framework of traditional US doctrine and are not strongly influenced by the relativism of Trump’s transactional approach. Between 75 and 80% of those surveyed view Russia as an enemy and consider Ukraine an ally. More than 60% want Kyiv to win, and two thirds support arms deliveries to Ukraine, including Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russian territory, as well as the provision of security guarantees akin to NATO’s Article 5.\n\nTrump’s peace efforts also fail to convince the American public. According to an Economist/YouGov poll, 42% of Americans believe the president is more likely to side with Russia, while only 22% think he takes a balanced position. Although Americans are not well informed about the details of the Trump administration’s peace plan, the net balance of its ratings is negative by 10 percentage points, falling to minus 17 once respondents become familiar with its specifics. Among Republicans, support for the plan drops from 57 to 38% after exposure to its details. This experiment suggests that American society would place responsibility for the consequences of an unstable agreement between Russia and Ukraine on Trump and his perceived pro Russian tilt. In contrast to Trump, most Americans see Putin as a cynical aggressor who cannot be trusted to honour agreements, with 87% believing he would violate any deal that is concluded.\n\nIn November, President Trump’s approval rating reached a new low for his second term, at 36% approving versus 60% disapproving, according to regular Gallup polling. The decline is driven by Republicans, whose approval fell from 90 to 86%, and by independents, where it dropped from 33 to 25%. The three policy areas in which Trump receives the lowest approval are healthcare, with 30% approving, the federal budget at 31%, and Ukraine at 31%. Notably, the lowest ratings of Trump’s Ukraine policy come not only from independents, among whom just 23% approve, but also from Republicans, at 67%, compared with 85% approval for his foreign policy overall. The Ukraine issue can therefore be described as one of the points of an anti Trump consensus in American society.\n\nDissatisfaction with the direction of policy on Ukraine and a shift in public attitudes were already evident in Gallup's August poll. Here, 46% of those surveyed said that the US was providing insufficient assistance to Ukraine, the highest level since the start of the war, while the share who viewed aid as excessive fell to 25%. In December 2024, the balance stood at 30% saying aid was insufficient versus 37% saying it was excessive. That marked the peak of American fatigue with the Ukraine issue. The subsequent shift in the opposite direction began as early as March and was driven mainly by independents.\n\nSimilarly, in December 2024, 50% of Americans believed that the United States’ main task in relation to the Russia–Ukraine conflict was to seek a rapid peace even at the cost of concessions to Russia, while 48% favoured helping Ukraine to regain territories occupied by Russia. By March and August, the share supporting the first position had fallen to 45%, while support for the second had risen to 52%. The share favouring the latter increased by 11 percentage points among Democrats and by 7 among Republicans. Particularly striking is the fact that in August 87% of Americans believed that Putin would violate any agreement concluded with Ukraine. Notably, exactly the same share of Ukrainian citizens believe that the Kremlin intends to use a 'peace agreement' merely as a pause before a renewed attack (→ Re:Russia: Peace on The Aggressor's Terms).\n\nAttitudes in December 2024 were shaped by Trump’s campaign rhetoric, in which he claimed that he would miraculously end the war in Ukraine as soon as he became president. To some extent, these promises appealed even to Democrats, among whom support for Ukraine also weakened at that time. Since then, however, the war has continued for another year, while the absence of US assistance has worsened Ukraine’s position. Moreover, Trump has failed to change Americans’ views of Vladimir Putin, who continues to appear in their eyes as an unprincipled and untrustworthy aggressor. In an October survey by the New York based Institute for Global Affairs, published under the title ‘The Reckless Peacemaker’, 42% of those surveyed said that Trump’s actions had worsened the situation surrounding the Russia–Ukraine war, while only 23% believed they had improved it. The same share, 23%, think that President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas almost two thirds of Americans believe that he does not.\n\nA major survey on national security issues conducted by the Ronald Reagan Institute in late October and early November clearly demonstrates the pro Ukrainian orientation of American public opinion. A majority, 62%, want Ukraine to win the war, while 11% would prefer a Russian victory. Unlike Trump, 75% of Americans view Ukraine as an ally, while Russia tops the list of US 'enemies', a label applied by 79% of those surveyed, ahead of China at 76% and Iran at 77%. The views of MAGA Republicans do not differ dramatically from the national average, with 73% considering Ukraine an ally and 74% viewing Russia as an adversary.\n\nTwo-thirds of those surveyed by the Reagan Institute support the supply of US weapons to Ukraine, which is 9 percentage points higher than last year. Among Republicans, support has increased by 15 percentage points to 59%, while among the most pro Trump respondents it has risen by as much as 20 percentage points to 62%. Support among independents remains the lowest at 53%, but is also increasing by 5 percentage points. Two thirds of all those surveyed, 65%, support sending Ukraine long range cruise missiles such as Tomahawks with permission to strike targets on Russian territory, and 69% support providing Ukraine with US backed security guarantees similar to NATO Article 5.\n\nIn the Reagan Institute survey, American attitudes appear perhaps at their most Reaganite, that is, consistently pro Ukrainian and anti Russian. This may partly reflect the broader framing of the survey, which was entirely focused on US security and geopolitical positioning and may have primed respondents accordingly. Overall, however, the findings suggest that the relativism and eclecticism of Trump’s foreign policy orientation, often described as transactionalism, have not yet undermined the core framework of traditional priorities and value based reference points of US foreign policy doctrine as understood by the average American. A total of 68% of those surveyed view NATO favourably, and 76% support adherence to the Alliance’s Article 5 commitments.\n\nThe latest online survey by The Economist/YouGov, conducted at the turn of November and December, reflects public reactions to the latest peacemaking efforts by the US administration and presents a more nuanced picture that nevertheless remains unfavourable to Trump. Some 42% of those surveyed believe that Trump is more likely to side with Russia, only 12% hold the opposite view, and 22% think that Trump maintains a neutral position. Around 30% of Americans say they are reasonably familiar with the substance of his administration’s peace proposals, while a further 28% know something about them. Overall, 33% tend to approve of Trump’s strategy on Ukraine, which broadly aligns with Gallup figures, while 46% tend to disapprove.\n\nWhen respondents were informed about the details of the Trump–Witkoff peace plan, including consent to reductions in the size of the Ukrainian armed forces, the transfer of Donbas to Russia, a ban on NATO membership, and a prohibition on deploying Alliance forces in Ukraine, their attitudes became more negative. Among those unfamiliar with the details, the net balance of approval for the 'peace plan' stood at minus 10 percentage points, while among those who learned its specifics it fell to minus 17. Independents, although generally negative about the plan, became slightly less critical after learning the details, with the net balance shifting from minus 25 to minus 18. By contrast, support among Republicans dropped sharply from 57 to 38% after exposure to the plan’s content. This experiment suggests that as the negative consequences of an unreliable agreement that is more favourable to Russia become increasingly apparent, American society is likely to place responsibility for them on Donald Trump.\n\nA majority of people surveyed by the Economist/YouGov, 56%, believe that the war in Ukraine is directly related to US national security, while 26% take the opposite, essentially isolationist view, and a further 17% are unsure. Among younger respondents under 30, Republicans, and those who voted for Trump, the share of isolationists who see the conflict as distant and irrelevant to the United States is higher, but remains below one third. These distributions also indicate that Americans’ foreign policy views are far less susceptible to Trump’s supposedly 'revolutionary' relativism in international affairs than is sometimes assumed.",

    "description": "Trump promised Americans higher tax refunds this year, but staffing cuts at the IRS could lead to customer service delays.",
    "fullText": "Average tax refunds this year are set to be nearly $750 higher than last year — but they might take a while getting to you, with a smaller IRS dedicated to getting them out.\n\nThe passage of President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" introduced new sweeping tax measures — which include no tax on overtime or tips and an expanded child tax credit — that will show up in many taxpayers' refunds this filing season.\n\nThe average tax refund is set to grow to $3,800 from the 2024 tax year's $3,052, according to the Tax Foundation. That's because the IRS hasn't directed employers to adjust how much they're withholding from workers' paychecks, meaning that the new tax provisions will show up instead in refunds.\n\nThere's just one problem: A much smaller IRS will be grinding away to get those checks to filers. The IRS's workforce shrank by 27% from January 2025 to December 2025, going from over 102,000 workers to around 74,000, according to National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins' annual report. Per that report, 22% of the agency's customer representatives left.\n\n\"The impact of these departures is not merely numeric,\" Collins' report said. \"Many departing employees were experienced workers whose institutional knowledge and technical expertise cannot easily be replaced.\"\n\nThe agency experienced significant cuts at the hands of DOGE as part of the unofficial office's goal to slash the government workforce. Employees at the agency previously told Business Insider when those cuts were underway that Americans could experience strained customer service and challenges with tax refunds, and those issues likely won't go away this tax season.\n\n\"Over the last couple of years, there has been a lot of disruption associated with the agency,\" Garrett Watson, the director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, told Business Insider. Watson said the warnings from the National Taxpayer Advocate \"showcase the risk the agency faces this tax season,\" alongside concerns from IRS workers over staffing reshuffles.\n\nA current IRS employee said that while it's too soon to tell how tax filing services will be affected, they anticipate that limited staff will slow things down — especially after a report that IRS employees from different departments who are not tax experts could be brought in to help. The employee said that those workers would have to be trained on the filing process, and that takes time, which could translate to delays on the customer's end.\n\n\"This may lead to lower quality service for taxpayers who reach out and a higher risk of errors on returns processed or corrected by the agency, as agents with less experience may struggle to address more complicated tax matters,\" Watson said.\n\nThe potential strains come as filers no longer have access to the IRS's now-shuttered Direct File program, the agency's in-house pilot software that allowed taxpayers to file more seamlessly for free. That program had garnered high satisfaction ratings, though only a small sliver of taxpayers used it before the Trump administration pulled the plug.\n\nIt also comes after what Collins described as the \"direct and lasting consequences\" of the IRS's pandemic-era challenges, when the cash-strapped agency was tasked with delivering economic relief, processing refunds, and working through an abrupt transition into remote work — all of which led to a backlog in processing refunds and IRS offices piled high with paper.\n\nThe IRS and Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment. In a press release marking the start of filing season, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS commissioner Scott Bessent said that \"President Trump is committed to the taxpayers of this country and improving upon the successful tax filing season in 2025.\"\n\n\"Prior to the passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, which delivered working families tax cuts, Treasury and IRS were diligently preparing to update forms and processes for the benefit of hardworking Americans, and I am confident in our ability to deliver results and drive growth for businesses and consumers alike,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"It's still early in filing season, and so far I'm not aware of any systemic problems. But there are vulnerabilities when you combine a rollout of new and technically complex provisions with staff reductions,\" Danny Werfel, who served as the IRS commissioner until January 2025, said. There are some \"good signs\" in his view — such as guidance on measures like tips, overtime, and vehicle-related credits already being issued.\n\n\"However, applying that guidance in real-world situations has historically led to more phone calls to the IRS,\" Werfel said. \"For example, when verifying a vehicle meets US assembly requirements, the taxpayer or preparer may seek IRS phone support. So service quality on phone lines is where rubber will hit the road.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street's foremost financial institutional has transformed from Wall Street's bedrock to a stock market liability.",
    "fullText": "From a purely statistical standpoint, Wall Street loves President Donald Trump. While getting from Point A to B was a roller-coaster ride, the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first, non-consecutive term in the Oval Office.\n\nSince his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump bull market has taken shape, yet again. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have climbed by 13%, 15%, and 18%, respectively, through the close of trading on Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are fueling this bull market rally, some of which can be directly attributed to Donald Trump's policies, there's also an unlikely headwind that threatens to completely halt this seemingly unwavering optimism in its tracks: the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore diving into what's been working, some objectivity is needed. Based on data compiled by Carson Investment Research, 26 of the last 33 presidential terms, including the present term for Trump, have yielded a positive aggregate return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. A president overseeing gains in the stock market is perfectly normal.\n\nOut of the 33 terms analyzed since March 1897, Carson Investment Group found Trump's first term yielded the eighth-best cumulative return. Spanning 129 years, Trump's initial foray in the Oval Office ranked in the top quartile among presidents.\n\nOne reason for this persistent optimism has been Trump's flagship tax and spending laws. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in December 2017, permanently reduced the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (the lowest level since 1939).\n\nAlthough the purpose of lowering taxes for businesses is to encourage hiring, acquisitions, and innovation, perhaps the most visible effect of the TCJA has been a significant increase in share buybacks. Share repurchases for S&P 500 companies are estimated to have topped $1 trillion in 2025, representing an all-time high. For time-tested companies with steady or growing net income, buybacks can help boost earnings per share, making their stock more fundamentally attractive.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday about American talks with Iran, his office said Saturday, while Iran's foreign minister threatened U.S. military bases in the region a day after the discussions.\n\n“The prime minister believes that all negotiations must include limiting the ballistic missiles, and ending support for the Iranian axis,” Netanyahu’s office said in a brief statement, referring to Tehran's support for militant groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. Trump and Netanyahu last met in December.\n\nThere was no immediate White House comment.\n\nThe U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran held indirect talks on Friday in Oman that appeared to return to the starting point on how to approach discussions over Tehran’s nuclear program.\n\nTrump called the talks “very good” and said more were planned for early next week. Washington was represented by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear program after sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships to the region amid Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests that killed thousands.\n\nGulf Arab nations fear an attack could spark a regional war, with memories fresh of the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June.\n\nFor the first time in negotiations with Iran, the U.S. on Friday brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table. U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, head of the military’s Central Command, then visited the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday with Witkoff and Kushner, the command said in a statement.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told journalists Friday that “nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats.” He said that diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling that this round of negotiations was over.\n\nOn Saturday, Araghchi told the Al Jazeera satellite news network that if the U.S. attacks Iran, his country doesn't have the ability to strike the U.S. “and therefore has to attack or retaliate against U.S. bases in the region.”\n\nHe said there is “very, very deep distrust” after what happened during the previous talks, when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during last year's Israel-Iran war.\n\nAraghchi also said the “missile issue” and other defense matters are “in no way negotiable, neither now nor at any time in the future.”\n\nTehran has maintained that these talks will be only on its nuclear program.\n\nHowever, Al Jazeera reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge to “not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.”\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.\n\nIsrael, a close U.S. ally, believes Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon and wants its program scrapped, though Iran has insisted that its atomic plans are for peaceful purposes. Israel also wants a halt to Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the region.\n\nAraghchi, speaking at a forum in Qatar on Saturday, accused Israel of destabilizing the region, saying that it “breaches sovereignties, it assassinates official dignitaries, it conducts terrorist operations, it expands its reach in multiple theaters.” He criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and called for “comprehensive and targeted sanctions against Israel, including an immediate arms embargo.”",

    "fullText": "President Trump is pleading with November voters to remember his policy victories—and not his racist Truth Social posts.\n\nTrump, 79, took to his social media platform Friday evening to brag about rolling back Obama-era restrictions on commercial fishing off the coast of New England. The post came one day after Trump earned widespread condemnation for posting an AI-generated video depicting the Obamas as apes.\n\n“Today, I signed a Presidential Proclamation to UNLEASH Commercial Fishing in the Atlantic Ocean, advancing the America First Fishing Policy!“, Trump wrote.\n\n“Please remember I did this for you, against strong Democrat opposition, and VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE MIDTERMS!”\n\nTrump’s Friday proclamation “restores commercial fishing access to all 4,913 square miles of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, located off the coast of New England.”\n\nPresident Obama established the nearly 5,000-square-mile preserve east of Cape Cod in 2016, looking to protect vulnerable undersea coral ecosystems. Trump rolled back the protections in his first term, and Joe Biden restored them during his.\n\nTrump described the proclamation as a benevolent favor to the New England area, which has voted for the Democratic candidate in all three presidential elections in which Trump has been on the ballot.\n\n“Hard to believe you vote for Democrats who did this to you, but not for ‘TRUMP,’ who gets you out of this Environmental and Economic Malaise,” the president scolded, adding, “VOTE REPUBLICAN FROM NOW ON!”\n\nTrump’s plea for midterm momentum comes at a time when all signs point to the Democrats dominating the GOP in November, with a serious chance to win back both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump’s awful polling on the economy and immigration—two issues that were strengths for him in his 2024 election victory—has become an albatross for vulnerable Republican incumbents.\n\nNow, beleaguered GOP politicians have to square their re-election bids with their party leader posting grossly racist videos of his old political foes.\n\nTrump posted a video that featured the heads of Barack and Michelle Obama superimposed onto apes during a late Thursday night posting spree.\n\nThe administration has thrown a myriad of excuses at the controversy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was merely a Lion King meme, even though there are no apes in The Lion King. Trump said he didn’t see the offending part of the video, as it occurs toward the end of the clip.\n\nThe GOP is reportedly panicking over the post.\n\n“I talked to several House members that are just besides themselves, and they don’t know how they’re going to handle it on the road,” Mulvaney added.\n\nNotably, some GOP incumbents have broken from Trump on the video. Nebraska Senator Pete Ricketts, up for reelection in 2026, was among several GOP politicians who unequivocally condemned Trump’s racist Obama post.\n\n“Even if this was a Lion King meme, a reasonable person sees the racist context to this,” he posted on X. “The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologize.”",

During the National Governors Association meeting later this month, President Donald Trump, 79, will only convene with Republican governors, state leaders learned on Friday.

    "fullText": "Whistleblower says that Tulsi Gabbard blocked agency from sharing report and delivered it to White House chief of staff\n\nLast spring, the National Security Agency (NSA) detected evidence of an unusual phone call between an individual associated with foreign intelligence and a person close to Donald Trump, according to a whistleblower’s attorney briefed on the existence of the call.\n\nThe highly sensitive communique, which has roiled Washington over the past week, was brought to the attention of the director of national intelligence (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard – but rather than allowing NSA officials to distribute the information further, she took a paper copy of the intelligence directly to the president’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, the attorney, Andrew Bakaj, said.\n\nOne day after meeting Wiles, Gabbard told the NSA not to publish the intelligence report. Instead, she instructed NSA officials to transmit the highly classified details directly to her office.\n\nDetails of this exchange between Gabbard and the NSA were shared directly with the Guardian and have not been previously reported. Nor has Wiles receipt of the intelligence report.\n\nThe office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) did not immediately respond to questions about the unusual call detected by the NSA, or Gabbard’s handling of the intelligence.\n\nOn 17 April, a whistleblower contacted the office of the inspector general alleging that Gabbard had blocked highly classified intelligence from routine dispatch, according to Bakaj, who has been briefed on details surrounding the highly sensitive phone call flagged by the NSA. The whistleblower filed a formal complaint about Gabbard’s actions on 21 May, Bakaj said.\n\nFor eight months, the intelligence report has been kept under lock and key, even after the whistleblower pushed to disclose details to congressional intelligence committees.\n\nActing inspector general Tamara A Johnson dismissed the complaint at the end of a 14-day review period, writing in a 6 June letter addressed to the whistleblower that “the Inspector General could not determine if the allegations appear credible”.\n\nThe letter stipulated that the whistleblower could take their concerns to Congress, only after receiving DNI guidance on how to proceed, given the highly sensitive nature of the complaint.\n\nThe independence of the watchdog’s office may be compromised, lawmakers have said, ever since Gabbard assigned one of her top advisers, Dennis Kirk, to work there on 9 May, two weeks after the whistleblower first made contact with the inspector general’s hotline.\n\nGabbard’s office issued its first public acknowledgment of the highly sensitive complaint in a letter addressed to lawmakers on Tuesday, one day after the Wall Street Journal reported on the classified brief. It was posted to the ODNI’s X account, including claims that the inspector general had not informed Gabbard of her obligations to transmit the complaint to Congress.\n\nBakaj said that the ODNI’s office cited various reasons for the delay in intelligence sharing, including the complaints’ top secret classification, the fall government shutdown and the intelligence community inspector general’s failure to notify Gabbard of her reporting requirements.\n\nTwo attorneys and two former intelligence professionals who reviewed details of the incident and ensuing complaint shared with the Guardian have identified what they believe are a series of procedural anomalies that raise questions about Gabbard’s handling of national intelligence and the whistleblower disclosure, which was reported to the inspector general as a matter of “urgent concern”.\n\nMembers of the “gang of eight”, a group of Senate and House leaders privy to classified information from the executive branch, received a heavily redacted version for review on Tuesday night. They have disagreed about the legality of Gabbard’s conduct, as well as the credibility of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTwo Republican lawmakers dismissed its credibility and backed Gabbard’s conduct, including the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who said in a statement on X that “the DNI took the necessary steps to ensure the material has handled and transmitted appropriately in accordance with law”.\n\nBut Democrats have raised questions about the delay. “The law is clear: when a whistleblower makes a complaint and wants to get it before Congress the agency has 21 days to relay it,” said the senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, in a Thursday press conference. “This whistleblower complaint was issued in May. We didn’t receive it until February.”\n\nWarner said that the months-long delay reflected an effort to “bury the complaint”.\n\nThe contents of the whistleblower complaint are still largely unknown. Bakaj, the whistleblower’s attorney, said that Gabbard’s office had redacted much of the complaint that was released to intelligence committee members on Tuesday, citing executive privilege.\n\n“I don’t know the contents of the complaint, but by exercising executive privilege they are flagging that it involves presidential action,” he said.\n\nOn 3 February, Bakaj again requested guidance from Gabbard’s office about how to share the whistleblower’s full report while taking appropriate precautions.\n\n“As you are well aware, our client’s disclosure directly impacts our national security and the American people,” Bakaj wrote. “This means that our client’s complete whistleblower disclosure must be transmitted to Congress, and that we, as their counsel, speak with members and cleared staff.”\n\nBakaj said that the DNI’s office did not respond to his letter by its Friday deadline. He plans to contact members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Monday to schedule an unclassified briefing on Gabbard’s conduct and the “underlying intelligence concerns”.\n\nMembers of the gang of eight have contacted the NSA to request the underlying intelligence that the whistleblower says Gabbard blocked, according to staff in Warner’s office.\n\nLawmakers can make routine requests for classified information directly from intelligence agencies such as the NSA. The request circumvents the ODNI’s involvement, as well as the office of the inspector general.\n\nThe leading Democrat on the House oversight committee, Stephen F Lynch, wrote a letter to acting inspector general Johnson to warn her that the integrity of the watchdog office could be compromised by Kirk’s May appointment to the group.\n\nKirk served in the first Trump administration and was a co-author of Project 2025, a policy roadmap for restructuring the federal government.\n\n“The appointment of a highly partisan advocate for prioritizing personal loyalty to President Trump above independence and professionalism in the federal government – and one who apparently answers to DNI Gabbard rather than to you – in a senior role within [the intelligence community inspector general’s office] raises troubling questions about the independence of the IC IG,” Lynch wrote.\n\nJohnson did not respond to a request for comment related to this story. She was replaced as the intelligence community inspector general in October by Christopher Fox.",

The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

Jennings, as many of President Trump’s most loyal lackeys have done, set about trying to normalize the 79-year-old’s latest announcement that, in return for $16 billion in withheld infrastructure funding, he wants some demands to be met. Trump, who turns 80 in June, has been obsessed with his legacy in recent weeks, frantically expanding his colonial ambitions, re-designing Washington, D.C. in his garish image, and acrimoniously renaming the country’s premier arts center after himself.",

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cellmate claims to have evidence that the Trump administration wanted the disgraced financier dead and left him unprotected “on purpose,” according to a document obtained by the Daily Beast.\n\nNicholas Tartaglione, a quadruple murderer and former police officer, filed a pardon/commutation petition last summer in which he claimed that Epstein was deliberately exposed to violence in the hope that he would not survive long enough to stand trial.\n\nPrior to Epstein’s death on Aug. 10, 2019, which officials ruled a suicide, jail bosses decided that America’s most high-profile prisoner should share a cell with an accused mass murderer for reasons that have never been explained.\n\nTartaglione had a reputation for extreme violence and a self-confessed hatred of child sex offenders. Tartaglione—who Epstein told prison guards had tried to kill him three weeks before he was found dead—claims “it is no coincidence” that he was “deliberately” moved into the same jail as Epstein and “placed in the same cell” as the convicted child sex offender.\n\nIn a 21-page petition obtained by the Daily Beast, Tartagloine says that he believes the Trump administration wanted Epstein “dead.”\n\nA spokesperson for White House said, “Anyone is able to submit a pardon request—much like everything else the Daily Beast writes, no one should take their garbage seriously. President Trump is the final decider on all clemency and pardon requests.”\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly denied any knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities, but has long been haunted by his decades-long association with the uber-wealthy pedophile.\n\nThe well-connected financier was found hanged in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City, while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking offences.\n\nReferences to the president and his many high-society and political associates identified in the Epstein files would likely have featured heavily during the public hearings.\n\nThe circumstances around Epstein’s death remain controversial, and many in Epstein’s circle—including his brother, Mark, his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, his former butler, and his legal team—do not believe that he took his own life.\n\nThis week, outspoken podcaster Joe Rogan, once a Trump supporter, also blasted the government for placing Epstein in a cell with Tartaglione. “It’s weird that they took a guy who is one of the most high-profile defendants ever, and you put him in jail with a mass murderer. Kind of crazy,” he said.\n\nReports into Epstein’s death blamed widespread institutional failings, but they were riddled with inconsistencies. A prison psychologist who saw Epstein in the weeks before his death reported that he said suicide was “against his religion” and insisted he was too cowardly to hurt himself because he couldn’t stand pain. Epstein’s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, later told a judge overseeing Epstein’s case: “At or around the time of his death we did not see a despairing or despondent person.”\n\nThe FBI’s observation memo described the image as “possibly an inmate,” while the DOJ inspector general’s review treated it as a corrections officer.\n\nAround three weeks before Epstein died, he was discovered semiconscious in his cell with injuries to his neck. He told guards Tartaglione had attempted to strangle him, before later withdrawing the complaint, saying he couldn’t remember what happened.\n\nTartaglione, who was moved out of Epstein’s cell after that incident, has denied attacking the financier and even claimed that he had tried to save Epstein’s life, having discovered him on the floor with a “piece of string” around his neck.\n\n“I never touched the man,” Tartaglione wrote in a September 2019 letter to the New York Daily News. “I despise anyone who hurts children, but whatever was going to happen to him, I was not going to be a part of it.”\n\nDespite this, Tartaglione admitted in the same letter to the Daily News that he had been a curious choice of cellmate for Epstein. “The staff here at MCC had hundreds of inmates to choose from yet I was their first choice,” Tartaglione wrote.\n\nTartaglione has now written a petition for a pardon to the president.\n\n“It is no coincidence that prior to trial I was transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and deliberately placed in the same cell as Jeffrey Epstein,” he wrote.\n\nHe explained that the bloody and violent nature of his crime was well-known to his prosecutor, Maureen Comey, who was also the lead prosecutor in the Epstein case.\n\nHe claims that there were several attempts made on his own life after he had been unwittingly dragged into the twisted tale of Jeffrey Epstein. “I clearly was not protected on purpose, nor was Epstein. I truly believe that the government wanted both Epstein and me dead,” he wrote.\n\nThe petition also includes obvious attempts to curry favor with the president. He makes accusations against Comey, the daughter of Trump nemesis James Comey, who has since been fired from the DOJ.\n\nHe says she tried to get Epstein to implicate Trump in exchange for his freedom, but also claims that Epstein “told me that President Trump was not involved with Epstein’s crimes.”\n\nThe former police officer also claims he was framed for the kidnapping and murders of four men. He was convicted in 2024 and is serving four consecutive life sentences, meaning he is unlikely ever to be released.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The video posted by Trump depicting the Obamas as apes is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights in the midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Black History Month, 2026 style.\n\nPresident Trump posted a video Thursday to his social media site that contains animated images depicting former President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nThe White House took down the post Friday, and after first calling it nothing more than a meme, they dubbed it a mistake by a staffer. Sure.\n\nBut while the justifiable outrage over this overt racism spins itself into a brief media circus (because we all know something else will come along in about three minutes), let's look a bit deeper into why this video is more than an affront to everything America stands for, or should stand for, anyway.\n\nIt's no accident that the images of the Obamas are embedded deep inside a video about voter fraud conspiracies from the 2020 election (which are untrue, if I need to say it again). This video is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights and voting access in the midterms.\n\n\"Absolutely, there's a connection to the vote,\" Melina Abdullah told me Friday. She's a professor at Cal State L.A. and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is about more than just about the Obamas,\" added Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. \"It's about people that are [perceived as] undermining our elections and our democracy.\"\n\nI caught Levin the day after he turned in a chapter about authoritarianism for a new book, which happens to look at how discrimination and the imposition of social hierarchies ties in with power.\n\nLet me summarize. Vulnerable groups are smashed down as dangerous and not fit to be full citizens, so a smaller group of elites can justify power by any means to protect society from these lowly and nasty influences.\n\nLet me make that messaging even simpler: Black and brown people are bad and shouldn't be allowed to participate in democracy because they don't deserve the right.\n\nHow does that play out at the ballot box?\n\nAll that talk about voter identification and election integrity is really about stopping people from voting — people who legally have the right to vote. Those who are least likely to be able to obtain proof of citizenship — which might require a passport or birth certificate, along with the money and know-how to get such documents — are often Black or brown people. They are often also poor, or poorer, and therefore have less time and money to put into obtaining documents, and also live in urban areas where they share polling places.\n\nIs it such a stretch to imagine some kind of federal oversight at those types of polling places, turning away — or simply intimidating away — legal voters who have long made up a strong bloc of the Democratic base?\n\nLet's hope that never happens. But the current undermining of the legitimacy of Black and brown voters is, Levin and Abdullah said, systemic and concerning.\n\nTrump's latest video is \"part of a floodgate of bigotry and conspiracy that relates to elections and immigrants and Black people and it's important to condemn the manner in which these puzzle pieces are put together to label African Americans and immigrants as a threat to democracy with respect to the vote,\" Levin said.\n\nThe premise of the video in question is that Democrats have engaged in a complicated and decades-long scheme to steal elections. It's presented as a documentary, and the images of the Obamas have been weirdly inserted as almost a subliminal flash near the end.\n\nIf you've missed the white supremacist postings that have now become commonplace on official government communications such as those from the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security, let me assure you that Levin is right and this primate video is indeed part of a \"firehose\" of white nationalist rhetoric coming not just from Trump, but from the federal government as a whole.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, for example, has turned its focus toward punishing diversity, equity and inclusion. Just this week, another federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, began a probe against Nike for allegedly discriminating against white people in hiring.\n\n\"It has been not even a dog-whistling, but a Xeroxing of the exact kind of terms that I've been looking at on white supremacists' and neo-Nazi websites for decades,\" Levin said.\n\nIt's not my place or intent to warn Black people about racism, because that would be ludicrous and insulting, but I'll warn the rest of us because in the end, authoritarianism targets everyone. This video is a clear statement that Trump's vision of America is one in which every non-white group, every vulnerable group really, is a second-class citizen.\n\n\"He's enabling an entire group of people who want to take this country back to a time when rampant violent white supremacy was enabled in the law,\" Abdullah said. \"What they mean is recapturing an old-school, oppressive racism that is pre-1965, pre-Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nThat message, Levin said, has \"a resonance with a decent part of his base,\" and when fed ceaselessly into the system, can have violent outcomes.\n\nLevin uses the example of when Trump tweeted during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" a phrase with a violent and racist history.\n\nLevin said Black people have always been the primary targets of hate crimes in the United States, but after that tweet, it was some of the \"worst days\" for violence aimed by race.\n\n\"When a high transmitter, like a president, circulates imagery with regard to prejudice, it creates these stereotypes and conspiracy theories, which then are the groundwork for further conspiracy theories and aggression,\" he added.\n\nAbdullah said she worries that even if the voter crackdown isn't officially sanctioned, those empowered conspiracy theorists will take action anyway.\n\n\"So the people who are so-called monitoring, self-appointed monitors ... this is who's going to be pulling people out of voter lines, and so this is what he's whipping up intentionally,\" she said.\n\nKeep your eye on the ball, folks, because the far-right Republicans running the show are laser-focused on it. The midterm elections have to go their way for them to remain in power.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that outcome is to only allow voters who see things their way.\n\nGet the L.A.

    "fullText": "For a long time, everyone was sure Barron Trump would grow up to be a mini version of his dad, US President Donald Trump. Many believed he would attend his dad’s alma mater, but he ended up attending New York University, seemingly for business. But what else business-like has Barron done? Well, we know he helped with his dad’s campaign, and now he’s fully stepping into the business role his dad has held.\n\nIn case you missed it, Barron just became a partner in a new beverage company called Sollos Yerba Mate Inc. The company boasts $1 million in capital, and it seems Barron, along with a couple of high school pals, is listed as a director, according to Silicon Valley.\n\nMelania Trump Confirms Barron’s Role In The Bro Vote\n\nDescribed as a “lifestyle beverage brand built around clean + functional ingredients,” the company is all about yerba, a caffeinated herbal tea popular in South America.\n\nSo it seems he’s turning more and more into Donald every day, especially in the business world.\n\nIf you need a rundown on Donald’s kids and their partners, we got you. Donald has five children in total. He and his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, welcomed three children named Donald Jr, born Dec 1977, Ivanka, born Oct 1981, and Eric, Jan 1984. Donald and his second wife, Marla Maples, welcomed a daughter named Tiffany in October 1993.\n\nHe then welcomed his fifth child, Barron, in March 2006, with his current wife, Melania.\n\nBefore you go, \n\nEverything to Know About Leonardo DiCaprio’s GF Vittoria Ceretti\n\nEvery Super Bowl Halftime Performer From 1993-2026\n\nChappell Roan's Topless Moment & More Of The Most Shocking Grammys Looks Of All Time",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he’d accept a GOP midterm loss to Democrats “if the elections are honest.”\n\nIt’s an ad nauseam refrain that the president has leaned on to boost future claims of rigging if elections don’t go his way ― but no less chilling.\n\nIn an interview with NBC’s Tom Llamas, Trump railed against Democrats’ opposition to voter ID, accused several blue cities of voting corruption and in pot-calling-kettle-black bombast declared, “We can’t allow cheating in elections.” As he did earlier this week, the president again hinted he would impose federal controls if states can’t conduct elections “honestly.”\n\nPolitics: Trump Is Making It Easier To Fire Federal Workers Who Disagree With Him\n\nTrump was indicted for allegedly scheming to overturn his 2020 election loss by falsely casting it as a stolen victory. That led to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a Trump-supporting mob. The case was, for the most part, dismissed after Trump won a second term.\n\nDemocrats have won a remarkable share of elections during Trump’s reportedly unpopular second term.\n\n“Will you trust the results of the midterms if Republicans lose control of Congress?” Llamas asked.\n\n“I will if the elections are honest,” Trump replied.\n\nIn tempting the irony gods, the president added, “I’m the last one that wants to complain.”\n\nFast-forward to 28:30 for the question many of us perhaps knew the answer to already:\n\nLike this article?

    "description": "The president is reportedly holding up a massive infrastructure project because he wants his name added to two major transit hubs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly wants his name on New York’s Penn Station and Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C.\n\nTrump told Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) that he would be willing to release federal funding for the Gateway tunnel project ― which the president froze last year ― in return for renaming the two transit hubs after him, according to a story first reported by Punchbowl News and later confirmed by CNN and NBC, among others.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nTrump has used his name as a brand for decades, especially on his real estate projects and golf clubs. But since returning to the White House, he’s been trying to force his name onto a much broader range of interests. He’s announced a new “Trump class” of U.S. battleships, a TrumpRx prescription drug portal, and even investment accounts for children called Trump Accounts.\n\nTrump even added his name to the U.S. Institute of Peace building and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. After artists objected to the latter and canceled their performances at the venue, the president announced a two-year shutdown for renovations.\n\nNow, Trump is reportedly trying to make previously approved funds for the Gateway project contingent on adding his name to more places.\n\nSchumer has reportedly rejected the offer.\n\n“The president stopped the funding, and he can restart the funding with a snap of his fingers,” an unnamed source close to Schumer told NBC.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers also fired back:\n\nNo. This is ridiculous. These naming rights aren’t tradable as part of any negotiations, and neither is the dignity of New Yorkers.

    "description": "Melania Trump used to walk red carpets in sparkly, sheer outfits. As first lady, she embraces suits, high-fashion designers, and bold accessories.",
    "fullText": "At a \"Celebrity\" party in 1998, Melania chose a figure-hugging silk dress in periwinkle. Its neckline scooped gently.\n\nMelania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles.\n\nThe gown's subtle slit was sexy without being over the top.\n\nShe attended the New York premiere of \"Charlie's Angels\" in a white skirt suit, but added a daring edge to the look with a sheer lace top.\n\nStrappy heels completed her outfit.\n\nWhen she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins.\n\nThe gown had a V-neckline, which mirrored the slit running up the center of the dress.\n\nBefore her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show.\n\nShe paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles.\n\nA full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice.\n\nThe black-and-tan dress had a feathered skirt with sheer detailing, and she paired it with coordinating shoes.\n\nTrump proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, the evening of the Met Gala.\n\nShe paired her 15-carat engagement ring with a black ball gown, which had a corset covered in cutouts.\n\nAttending a Fashion Week event, Melania paired fitted jeans with a sheer pink babydoll top. High heels completed the look.\n\nMelania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump.\n\nShe wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments.\n\nBlack dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006.\n\nThe silk dress had lace detailing on the sheer bodice and the neckline. Crisscross straps and lace paneling on the skirt added to the sexy gown.\n\nAt the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes.\n\nMelania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump.\n\nShe wore all-black, and her hat and wrap featured fuzzy detailing. Knee-high boots completed the wintry ensemble.\n\nMelania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress.\n\nThe dress had a bow on the neckline and ruffle detailing on its mermaid skirt.\n\nAt the premiere of \"Nine,\" Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black cocktail dress had a form-fitting bodice with a subtle sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. The top buttons of her white blouse were open, and the sleeves poked out from under the jacket.\n\nBlack, pointed heels complemented the ensemble.\n\nMelania's gray dress for her \"Good Afternoon America\" appearance had a professional feel.\n\nThe fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. She also wore black heels.\n\nWhen Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code.\n\nHer white, sleeveless dress had a scooped neckline and a pleated skirt that felt like an elevated version of a golf ensemble. She added white heels to the look.\n\nThe jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace.\n\nBlack heels accented the ensemble.\n\nAfter Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on \"Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015.\"\n\nMelania chose a simple pink dress with short sleeves and a modest neckline for the interview. Her pink, pointed shoes matched the dress.\n\nLauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling \"two narratives\" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye.\n\nBut after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because \"she was trying to say something with more storytelling\" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC.\n\nFor the RNC, Melania wore the \"Margot\" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles.\n\nThe dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past.\n\nMelania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves.\n\nThe silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady.\n\n\"It was so curated,\" Rothman said of the look. \"It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory.\"\n\nRothman said the nostalgia in the look lent Melania some of the power Jackie Kennedy held in the American mind, striking the right tone for the beginning of her tenure as first lady.\n\nRalph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency.\n\nMelania changed into a gown custom-designed by Hervé Pierre Braillard for his Hervé Pierre line.\n\nThe form-fitting, cream dress had off-the-shoulder sleeves made of the same fabric as a three-dimensional swath that cut across the bodice, creating volume. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist.\n\nBraillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term.\n\nIn 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nThe Zara jacket instantly became controversial, leading people to speculate that the first lady was sending a message to the president or migrants at the border.\n\nIn her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now,\" Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to \"fake news\" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported.\n\nMelania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit.\n\nShe wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels.\n\nWhen the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble.\n\nBut when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print.\n\n\"Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes,\" Rothman said. \"She went from wearing something super fitted to something loose that is right out of Palm Beach.\"\n\nMelania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022.\n\nFor the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. The knee-length, silver gown had long sleeves. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania paired a black long-sleeved top with a high-waisted, midi-length brown skirt from Martin Grant, which was belted with a bow at her waist. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors.\n\nA black Chanel bag completed her look.\n\nMelania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024.\n\nThe gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg.\n\nIt was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics.\n\nMelania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket was elegant, and Melania paired it with navy pumps and a white scarf. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white.\n\n\"It's a huge fashion moment,\" Rothman said of Melania's hat. She said the summery shape of the hat nodded to Melania's day-to-day life at Mar-a-Lago, while the wool texture and dark colors spoke to the role she was stepping back into.\n\n\"She wore a hat that bridges her worlds together,\" she added.\n\nMelania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side.\n\nA black choker made of the same fabric tied the look together.\n\nThe first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025.\n\nThe camel-toned, three-piece suit included a jacket, fitted trousers, and a vest. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel.\n\nIn September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.\n\nFor a white-tie dinner at Windsor Castle, Melania wore a bright-yellow gown designed by Carolina Herrera. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt.\n\nThe gown's bright color was a bold choice for the royal dinner and a marked change from the neutral looks Melania had been wearing for much of 2025.\n\nThe Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025.\n\nThe first lady wore a strapless, green gown for the dinner. Designed by Elie Saab, the $3,350 dress featured ruching on the bodice and skirt, with a slit running up the center.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but it also radiated a warm welcome for Salman, as the deep-green fabric resembled the colors of the Saudi flag. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well.\n\nWhen the 2025 Christmas tree arrived at the White House, Melania donned a knee-length white coat. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past.\n\nShe wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style.\n\nAt the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting \"Melania.\"\n\nHer high-neck suit jacket was buttoned down the center and belted at the waist. Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.\n\nThe outfit struck a professional, restrained tone, particularly compared to the colorful looks she wore in the second half of 2025.",

    "fullText": "UPDATED: While Democrats have condemned Donald Trump’s Truth Social post of a video featuring a racist AI depiction of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, one of the president’s strident defenders also called it out.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who is chairing the GOP’s Senate campaign efforts this year, wrote on X, “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it.”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nDonald Trump Now Says He “Shouldn’t Be Involved” In DOJ Review Of A Netflix Or Paramount Acquisition Of Warner Bros.\n\nHoda Kotb Returns To 'Today' To Highlight Show Of Support For Savannah Guthrie And Family After Disappearance Of Their Mother Nancy\n\nPraying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it. https://t.co/gADoM13ssZ\n\n— Tim Scott (@votetimscott) February 6, 2026\n\nA couple hours after Scott’s statement, the Trump post was taken down, with a White House official saying, “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nEarlier on Friday morning, the White House acknowledged that Trump posted the video, and defended the president for doing so. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”\n\nLeavitt’s comments were a contrast to an incident in Trump’s first term, when Roseanne Barr, then starring in her own ABC sitcom, referred to Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to the Obamas, as the offspring to the “planet of the apes.” The Walt Disney Co. fired Barr. At the time, then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called out what she saw as a media double standard, but told reporters that “no one is defending” the sitcom star’s comments.\n\nAnother Republican, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), who faces a competitive reelection race this cycle, wrote, “The President’s post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Obamas did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe NAACP said in a statement, “Trump posting this video — especially during Black History Month— is a stark reminder of how Trump and his followers truly view people. And we’ll remember that in November.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement, “President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans. They represent the best of this country. Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder. Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual? Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump’s disgusting bigotry.”\n\nMSNBC and CNN covered the post during morning programming on Friday, while Fox News largely ignored it.\n\nThe clip of the Obamas features an “@XERIAS_X” watermark, and it appears that the account originally posted the video in October last year. The 55-second video portrays Trump as a lion, while Hillary Clinton and Zohran Mamdani are depicted as a warthog and hyena respectively.\n\nThe @XERIAS_X account has a profile photo of Pepe the Frog dressed as Trump. The account claimed credit for the “fighter jet poop” AI video posted by Trump during the “No Kings” protests last year.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "description": "Immigration agents have taken to venting about their frustrations online as they have been placed at the center of the Trump administration’s crackdown",
    "fullText": "Thousands of federal immigration agents have been complaining about their jobs in an online forum, where they blasted “incompetent leadership,” according to a report.\n\nAgents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies, part of the Department of Homeland Security, have taken to venting about their frustrations online as they have been placed at the center of the Trump administration’s crackdown.\n\nThere are over 5,000 users on the unnamed forum seen by WIRED claiming to be current and former federal immigration agents. There, they complained of the negative public perception of the agencies, long working hours and “incompetent” leadership, according to the outlet.\n\nThe outlet noted that users on the forum do not need to prove their employment to join and it had not confirmed the identities of the people posting.\n\nUsers were candid about the public perception of the agencies amid the Trump administration’s immigration surge in cities across the U.S.\n\n“I'm all for removing illegals, but snatching dudes off lawn mowers in Cali and leaving the truck and equipment just sitting there? Definitely not working smarter,” said one user in a post viewed by WIRED.\n\nPosts in the forum reportedly amped up following public scrutiny and outrage of the agencies in Minnesota, where U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nOne user started a thread titled, “Ready to resign, had enough stress” five days before Pretti was killed. “I have 2.3 years left for full special category retirement … but don't know if I'll make it. Tired of this Agency. Employees being abused badly,” the user reportedly wrote.\n\nThe user also complained of agents being deployed for temporary duty at short notice in cities where the administration is carrying out large-scale immigration operations.\n\n“No more weekends off, more work than ever before in 18 years. No more union. No more down time,” the post reportedly continued. “This is not what any of us envisioned for our last years of career when we are in our 50's.”\n\nOther users lashed out at Homeland Security leadership.\n\n“Led by some of the worst leadership I’ve ever witnessed, from the local level all the way up to the national stage, this agency has managed to turn a righteous mission into a complete clown show,” another user reportedly wrote.\n\n“This is going to be a train wreck that we may not survive,” another reportedly said.\n\nThe Independent had contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nReports of “plummeting” morale among federal law enforcement officers tasked with carrying out the administration’s immigration operations have been widespread since the unrest in Minneapolis. In a report at the end of January, more than 20 current and former immigration officials told The New York Times of their discontent in the hours following the fatal shooting of Pretti.\n\nCurrent and former ICE officials who spoke with the outlet anonymously said they were “unhappy with the sharp rhetoric” coming from top White House and Homeland Security officials, who were quick to blame Pretti.\n\nOne ICE agent told the Times that he had “always given the benefit of the doubt to the government in these situations,” but that he now no longer believed “any of the statements they put out anymore.”\n\n“We lost all trust,” a current ICE official added. “I’m not sure I can see how we exist three years from now.”\n\nFox News correspondent Bill Melugin also reported “extreme frustration” in the department over “some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed in the aftermath of the shooting.”\n\n“These sources say this messaging from DHS officials has been catastrophic from a PR and morale perspective, as it is eroding trust and credibility,” Melugin reported Sunday.\n\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said ICE and border patrol agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer.”\n\n“The men and women of ICE and Border Patrol are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters,” McLaughlin said in a previous statement to The Independent. “Like everyone else, our officers just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

    "fullText": "With President Donald Trump standing awkwardly behind him, a Democratic congressman used his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast to urge Trump to “think of families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nSpeaking at the bipartisan Washington, D.C., event on Thursday shortly after Trump gave a rambling address, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) offered a prayer for “the future of this nation,” and asked God to “lead this president into greater levels of compassion.”\n\nNews: Minneapolis Mayor Shreds ‘Thoughts And Prayers’ Over School Shooting: Kids ‘Were Literally Praying’\n\nJackson, the son of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, said, “Today, we remind him that the lives of millions of people are in his hands, and that he has the power to turn mourning into dancing or to reduce the country into a cosmic elegy of chaos and suffering.”\n\nJackson continued by calling on Trump to be “mindful of the poor” and “be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening on farms in the Midwest, in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nHe added that “we are all Americans, all made in the image of God, and that none of us are free unless all of us have our freedoms protected.” (Watch video at the end of the story.)\n\nWhen the prayer finished, Trump shook Jackson’s hand and appeared to say, “Great words.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nDuring his address, the Republican president said he didn’t know “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”\n\nThe plea to Trump came amid weeks of chaos in Minnesota as a result of his administration’s immigration crackdown, with the president’s rhetoric helping to sow discord.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nThe president has baselessly accused the state of harboring thousands of violent undocumented immigrants, calling them the “worst of the worst.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protests against the influx, federal agents have shot dead two U.S. citizens ― 37-year-old Renee Good and Alex Pretti, also 37 ― in separate incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it is scaling back immigration operations around Minnesota by withdrawing about 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers sent to the state.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News later that day, Trump admitted he could have adopted “a little bit of a softer touch” in the region.\n\nwow -- with Trump standing behind him, a man (not sure who he is) offers this prayer: \"We pray that he would be mindful of the poor and that he would be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.\" pic.twitter.com/toJk9vIboF\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter Setting Minneapolis Ablaze, Trump Now Appears Interested In Dampening The Flames\n\nJD Vance Won't Apologize For Amplifying Smears Against Alex Pretti\n\nTrump's Border Czar Announces 700 Immigration Officers To Immediately Leave Minnesota",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a whopper of a dodge when NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Llamas asked him if he would testify to Congress about the Epstein files like former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to do.\n\nLlamas scored a big exclusive interview with Trump that’s set to air on Super Bowl Sunday, with clips rolling out in advance.\n\nIn an extended preview that aired on Tuesday night’s edition of NBC News Now’s Top Story with Tom Llamas, the subject of the Epstein files came up only once, when Trump brought it up in relation to the Clintons.\n\nWhen Llamas cut in to ask if he would follow their lead, Trump claimed “they’ve already brought me”:\n\nTOM LLAMAS: We didn’t get a chance to speak about the DOJ. I appreciate all your time and of your staff’s time. They’ve been very, very kind.\n\nShould anybody else expect the DO J to kind of come after them like you’ve come over after some of your political enemies?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we remember this tale. I was impeached twice, two fake impeachments, won both of them easily.\n\nRepublicans stood by me 100 percent, but I won both them. I was indicted 87 different times, and then you ask me that question.\n\nI think I’m extremely moderate, especially for what they did to me. They wanted to take me down. I said to somebody, do me a favor, add up the counts. If I lost, you know, I won.\n\nBut if I lost these cases, add the counts and tell me, how long would I have to serve in prison? You know what they came up with? 287 years. I said, I’d better win.\n\nTOM LLAMAS: In your mind that calculation means it’s okay for the DOJ to go after your political enemies?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could be involved. You know, I’m the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. I could involved, but I’m not. I don’t choose to.\n\nBut when they say to me, oh, you’re going after people, I got indicted all of those times. It’s 287 years in jail.\n\nThey were willing to put, you know, they asked me a question yesterday at the press conference about Clinton because of the testimony. The Epstein thing, which turned out that I have nothing to do, and they did, about Epstein.\n\nAnd they said, do you think it’s terrible what, you know, with the subpoenas and everything, and they’re disobeying the subpoenas.\n\nAnd I actually said, it’s a shame. You have an ex-president, and you have, you now, the president’s wife and secretary of state. And I said, It’s a shame. It is a shame,\n\nTOM LLAMAS: NBC News broke the story today. I don’t know if you saw it, that the Democrats are already saying, if you bring President Bill Clinton, and he has to testify, we’re bringing President Trump. What do you say to that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think they might say that, you know. But they’ve already brought me. See, I’ve been brought. They had me indicted many, many times. Many, many, times. They didn’t do that to Clinton.\n\nPresident Trump once faced criminal trials in Washington D.C., Georgia, New York, and Florida on a total of 91 felony counts — none of which involved Jeffrey Epstein, and none of which resulted in his testimony under oath.\n\nTrump did testify at the E. Jean Carroll civil trial, but was not asked about Epstein.\n\nHe didn’t win all of the criminal cases — Trump was found “guilty” on all 34 felony counts in the Stormy Daniels hush money-election interference trial. He was eventually sentenced to an unconditional discharge on January 10, 2025 after his election victory.\n\nAnd Republicans were not with him “one-hundred percent” in his impeachment trials. Seven GOP senators joined Democrats in voting to convict in his second impeachment trial, and then-Sen. Mitt Romney (R-MI) voted to convict in the first.\n\nWatch above via NBC News Now’s Top Story with Tom Llamas.\n\nThe post Trump Drops Whopper of a Claim When NBC Anchor Asks if He’ll Testify on Epstein Files in Blockbuster Interview first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan is refusing to voluntarily comply with a Justice Department investigation into a video she organized urging U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders” — escalating a dispute that President Donald Trump has publicly pushed.\n\nIn letters first obtained by The Associated Press, Slotkin’s lawyer informed U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro that the senator would not agree to a voluntary interview about the video. Slotkin's legal team also requested that Pirro preserve all documents related to the matter for “anticipated litigation.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer separately wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, declining to sit for an FBI interview about the video and urging her to immediately terminate any inquiry.\n\nThe refusal marks a potential turning point in the standoff, shifting the burden onto the Justice Department to decide whether it will escalate an investigation into sitting members of Congress or retreat from an inquiry now being openly challenged.\n\n“I did this to go on offense,” Slotkin said in an interview Wednesday. “And to put them in a position where they’re tap dancing. To put them in a position where they have to own their choices of using a U.S. attorney’s office to come after a senator.”\n\n‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back'\n\nLast November, Slotkin joined five other Democratic lawmakers — all of whom previously served in the military or at intelligence agencies — in posting a 90-second video urging U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.\n\nThe lawmakers said Trump's Republican administration was “pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens” and called on troops to “stand up for our laws.”\n\nThe video sparked a firestorm in Republican circles and soon drew the attention of Trump, who accused the lawmakers of sedition and said their actions were “punishable by death.”\n\nThe Pentagon later announced it had opened an investigation into Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot who appeared in the video. The FBI then contacted the lawmakers seeking interviews, signaling a broader Justice Department inquiry.\n\nSlotkin said multiple legal advisers initially urged caution.\n\n“Maybe if you keep quiet, this will all go away over Christmas,” Slotkin said she was told.\n\nBut in January, the matter flared again, with the lawmakers saying they were contacted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, security threats mounted. Slotkin said her farm in Michigan received a bomb threat, her brother was assigned a police detail due to threats and her parents were swatted in the middle of the night.\n\nHer father, who died in January after a long battle with cancer, “could barely walk and he’s dealing with the cops in his home,” she said.\n\nSlotkin said a “switch went off” in her and she became angry: “And I said, ‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back.’”\n\nDemocratic senators draw a line\n\nThe requests from the FBI and the Justice Department have been voluntary. Slotkin said that her legal team had communicated with prosecutors but that officials “keep asking for a personal interview.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer, Preet Bharara, in the letter to Pirro declined the interview request and asked that she “immediately terminate any open investigation and cease any further inquiry concerning the video.” In the other letter, Bharara urged Bondi to use her authority to direct Pirro to close the inquiry.\n\nBharara wrote that Slotkin’s constitutional rights had been infringed and said litigation is being considered.\n\n“All options are most definitely on the table,” Slotkin said. Asked whether she would comply with a subpoena, she paused before responding: “I’d take a hard look at it.”\n\nBharara, who's representing Slotkin in the case, is a former U.S. attorney in New York who was fired by Trump in 2017 during his first administration. He's also representing Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California in a separate case involving the Justice Department.\n\nKelly has similarly pushed back, suing the Pentagon last month over attempts to punish him for the video. On Tuesday, a federal judge said that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon’s censuring of Kelly as he weighed whether to intervene.\n\nSlotkin said she's in contact with the other lawmakers who appeared in the video, but she wouldn't say what their plans were in the investigations.\n\nTrump has frequently and consistently targeted his political opponents. In some cases, those attacks have had the unintended consequence of elevating their national standing.\n\nIn Kelly’s case, he raised more than $12.5 million in the final months of 2025 following the “illegal orders” video controversy, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nSlotkin, like Kelly, has been mentioned among Democrats who could emerge as presidential contenders in 2028.\n\nShe previously represented one of the nation’s most competitive House districts before winning a Senate seat in Michigan in 2024, even as Trump carried the state.\n\nSlotkin delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress last year and has since urged her party to confront him more aggressively, saying Democrats had lost their “alpha energy” and calling on them to “go nuclear” against Trump’s redistricting push.\n\n“If I’m encouraging other people to take risk, how can I not then accept risk myself?\" Slotkin said. “I think you’ve got to show people that we’re not going to lay down and take it.”",
