    "fullText": "UFC fighters with visa problems just learned something in Houston over the weekend: ask and ye shall receive.\n\nUros Medic won his co-main fight against Geoff Neal via violent first round knockout (watch it here) and then followed that up not with a request — not for a $100,000 bonus (which he got anyway) but for help with his immigration issues.\n\n“Now I got one little problem,” Medic declared in the cage. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. President, Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we gotta go to Belgrade, Serbia for the UFC this summer.”\n\nWe have our doubts the UFC will make the trip to Serbia any time soon, but Medic now can because UFC CEO Dana White got U.S. president Donald Trump on the phone to take care of his issues.\n\n“I’m back in his office and Dana’s got president Donald Trump on speaker phone,” Medic said at the post-fight press conference. “I’m just standing there and I cannot believe what’s happening. I’m talking to the president, and he said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. You can travel. Just give Dana documentation, the information that you need.'”\n\n“I’m just blown away. I mean, I love Mr. President, and his wife is from Slovenia, First Lady Melania … It was just amazing for me to be able to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him. And obviously, his wife, who is from where I’m from – or I’m considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country. It’s like a five-hour drive. That’s nothing for America. Like, you can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.”\n\n“So yeah, I’m still processing all of it.”\n\nThat’s great news for Medic, who has been unable to travel back to his home country for three years now. Between the knockout of the year candidate, his $100,000 bonus, and getting his visa fixed, it’s been a pretty good weekend for the Serbian fighter.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday is likely to be a test run of the message Republicans will give to voters in November's elections for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThe president and his party appear vulnerable, with polls showing much of America distrusts how Trump has managed the government in his first year back in office. In addition, the Supreme Court last week struck down one of the chief levers of his economic and foreign policy by ruling he lacked the power to impose many of his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThough Trump is expected to focus on domestic issues, his intensifying threats about launching military strikes on Iran over its nuclear program cast a shadow over the address.\n\nHere are a few things to watch as Trump tries to make his case:\n\nTrump swept back into the White House on promises to bring down prices and restore order to immigration in America. But on both issues, public sentiment has turned against him.\n\nOnly 39% of U.S. adults approve of his economic leadership and just 38% support him on immigration, according to the latest Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey. Those low numbers show the country is still fretting about the costs of groceries, housing and utilities, a problem compounded by Trump's whipsawing use of tariffs. They also show how the public was disturbed by videos of violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents.\n\nSince his party passed a massive tax cut bill last year, Trump has yet to unveil major new policy ideas on the economy. In recent speeches, he has largely offered the public reruns about his tax cuts, plans to reduce mortgage rates and a new government website for buying prescription drugs.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling against many of Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday and the president vowing to use other means to forge ahead with import taxes will only prolong the economic turmoil over trade and prices.\n\n“I think it makes it even more important that the speech really focus on the economy,\" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist.\n\nConant said between the tariff ruling and a Commerce Department report on Friday that showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the final three months of last year, \"the president needs to bolster his economic message.”\n\nThe administration is trying to make the case that despite Trump's rewiring of global trade and tax cuts, the economy is still struggling because of choices made in 2021 and 2022 by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. But Trump is also seeking to take credit for positive signs in the current economy, such as recent stock market gains.\n\n“Watch the State of the Union. We’re going to be talking about the economy. We inherited a mess,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nOf course, Trump made the same kind of argument in his address to a joint session of Congress last year, invoking the Biden name 13 times.\n\nDespite Trump's America First credo, his aggressive approach abroad over the past year has sparked concerns among some of his supporters about whether he should spend more time focusing on voters at home.\n\nTrump, who's made it clear he covets a Nobel Peace Prize, is likely to use the speech to remind Americans of his attempts to try to broker peace accords in global conflicts.\n\nBut in many respects, the president hasn't been extending olive branches. Within the past year, his administration has launched strikes in Yemen, Nigeria and Iran, along with an ongoing campaign of lethal military strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels near South America. Trump also shocked the world in January with a surprise raid to capture Venezuela's then-leader, Nicolás Maduro, and floated the idea of using force to seize Greenland.\n\nIn recent weeks, as he pressures Iran, Trump has bolstered the U.S. military's presence in the Middle East. But he has yet to make a clear case to voters about what his actions overseas mean for their lives.\n\nHe might even minimize foreign policy in his State of the Union despite his belief that it's been a major success.\n\n“For as much as foreign policy has dominated his last year in office, this speech will mostly focus on the economy,” Conant predicted.\n\nVice President JD Vance offered a similar prediction, saying in an interview Saturday on Fox News Channel that in the speech, “you’re going to hear a lot about the importance of bringing jobs back into our country, of reshoring manufacturing, of all these great factories that are being built.”\n\nHe said Trump would also speak about lowering energy costs.\n\nThe State of the Union used to be about recapping accomplishments and seeking to unite the country, but it increasingly reflects divisions in society.\n\n“What you’re going to expect is some version of a campaign speech in which the Democrats are the villains, the Republicans he likes are the heroes, and he is the savior not only of the nation but of the globe,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump supporters might cherish the moment in 2020 when the president midspeech reunited a military family. He also bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host and author who died in 2021. But that moment turned off Democrats who saw Limbaugh as a destructive figure in political media.\n\nTrump is delivering the speech, but his audience sitting in the House chamber has a big role, too. When Trump delivered his 2020 State of the Union, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi theatrically ripped up a copy of the speech afterward, overshadowing much of what Trump said.\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has said in a letter to colleagues “it is important to have a strong, determined and dignified Democratic presence in the chamber,” indicating some members might choose not to attend in protest to Trump. But there's also the possibility of Democrats razzing Trump as Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, did in 2025, leading him to be removed from the chamber.\n\nIf Trump in his speech lays out a fuller case for why he's using other mechanisms in federal law to continue his tariffs, Conant said it'll be interesting to see the reaction from lawmakers.\n\n“I think that any House Republicans that don't applaud his tariffs are going to be featured prominently on the telecast,” he said.\n\nWhile some presidential phrases endure, much of the rhetoric in State of the Unions is forgettable. And with Trump — who's known for veering off-script — there's a good chance a stray comment or a social media post could step on his message.\n\nMatt Latimer, a former Republican speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, noted in an email that people hear the president talk all of the time, so the State of the Union has lost much of its luster.\n\nA State of the Union “only matters in moments when the country is undergoing a great trauma — a war, an attack, a global crisis — and a president and Congress want to speak in a (mostly) united voice to the country,” he said. “That’s not what we are experiencing now.”",

    "fullText": "PARIS (AP) — France will summon U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner to protest comments by the Trump administration over the beating death of a far-right activist, the foreign affairs minister said.\n\nJean-Noel Barrot was reacting to a statement by the State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau, which posted on X that “reports, corroborated by the French Minister of the Interior, that Quentin Deranque was killed by left-wing militants, should concern us all.”\n\nDeranque, a far-right activist, died of brain injuries last week from a beating in the French city of Lyon. He was attacked during a fight on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.\n\nHis killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as some 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organized by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.\n\n“We reject any instrumentalization of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”\n\nThe State Department said in its post that “violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque’s death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety. We will continue to monitor the situation and expect to see the perpetrators of violence brought to justice.”\n\nSeven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.\n\nBarrot said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including U.S. decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court.\n\nBarrot said both are targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions.\n\nKushner was asked to attend a meeting at the foreign affairs ministry scheduled on Monday evening, according to diplomatic sources. He had already been summoned in August last year over his letter to Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France’s foreign officials met with a representative of the U.S. ambassador since the diplomat did not show up.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will stand before Congress on Tuesday to deliver the annual State of the Union address to a suddenly transformed nation.\n\nOne year back in office, Trump has emerged as a president defying conventional expectations. He has executed a head-spinning agenda, upending priorities at home, shattering alliances abroad and challenging the nation's foundational system of checks and balances. Two Americans were killed by federal agents while protesting the Trump administration's immigration raids and mass deportations.\n\nAs the lawmakers sit in the House chamber listening to Trump's agenda for the year ahead, the moment is an existential one for the Congress, which has essentially become sidelined by his expansive reach, the Republican president bypassing his slim GOP majority to amass enormous power for himself.\n\n“It’s crazy,\" said Nancy Henderson Korpi, a retiree in northern Minnesota who joined an Indivisible protest group and plans to watch the speech from home. “But what is disturbing more to me is that Congress has essentially just handed over their power.”\n\nShe said, “We could make some sound decisions and changes if Congress would do their job.”\n\nThe country is at a crossroads, celebrating its 250th anniversary while experiencing some of the most significant changes to its politics, policies and general mood in many Americans' lifetimes.\n\nThe president muscled his agenda through Congress when he needed to — often pressuring lawmakers with a phone call during cliffhanger votes — but more often avoided the messy give-and-take of the legislative process to power past his own party and the often unified Democratic opposition.\n\nTrump's signature legislative accomplishment so far is the GOP’s big tax cuts bill, with its new savings accounts for babies, no taxes on tips and other specialty deductions, and steep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP food aid. It also fueled more than $170 billion to Homeland Security for his immigration deportations.\n\nBut the GOP-led Congress has largely stood by as Trump dramatically seized power through hundreds of executive actions, many being challenged in court, and a willingness to do whatever it takes to impose his agenda.\n\n“Retrieving a lost power is no easy business in our constitutional order,” wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the Supreme Court's landmark rebuke of Trump's tariffs policy on Friday.\n\nGorsuch said that without the court stepping in on major questions, “Our system of separated powers and checks-and-balances threatens to give way to the continual and permanent accretion of power in the hands of one man.”\n\nFrom slashing the federal workforce to upending the childhood vaccine schedule to attacking Venezuela and capturing that country's president, Trump's reach appeared to know no bounds.\n\nHis administration launched investigations of would-be political foes, imposed his name on historic buildings, including the storied John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and perhaps most visibly has been rounding up people and converting warehouses into detention holding centers for deportations.\n\nAt almost every step of the way, there were moments when Congress could have intervened but did not.\n\nDemocrats, in the minority, often tried to push back, including by halting routine Homeland Security funds unless there are restraints on the immigration actions.\n\nBut Republicans believe the country elected the president and gave their party control of Congress to align with his agenda, according to one senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the dynamic.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana has said Trump will be the “most consequential” president of the modern era.\n\nDemocrats plan to either boycott the speech or sit in stony silence.\n\n“The state of the union is falling apart,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThere have been times when Congress held its own against the White House, but they have been rare — as in the high-profile bipartisan push from Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Ca., to force the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, over the objections of Johnson and GOP leadership.\n\nThe flex of congressional power has more often come from a few renegade Republicans joining with most Democrats to put a check on the president, as when the House voted to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. The Senate advanced a war powers resolution to prevent military action in Venezuela without congressional approval, but backed off after Trump intervened.\n\nThose have been mostly symbolic votes, because Congress would not have the numbers to overcome any expected Trump veto.\n\nMore often, the Congress has accommodated Trump, by rolling back already approved bipartisan funding for USAID foreign aid or public broadcasting or failing to stop the U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats that killed two survivors in the Caribbean. When Trump issued a Day One pardon of some 1,500 people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the Republicans in Congress did not object.\n\nAnd as Trump's Department of Government Efficiency with billionaire Elon Musk started firing federal workers, GOP lawmakers signaled approval by forming their own DOGE caucus on Capitol Hill.\n\n“The central question for us is does the public understand what's at stake” said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization focused on government management and democracy. “We are in the midst of the most significant transformation of our government and our public servants in our history as a country.”\n\nHe said some 300,000 federal employees were fired or moved on, while 100,000 new hires or rehires have largely gone to Homeland Security.\n\nIn courtrooms across the country, cases are being filed against the administration at record levels, as Congress was “asleep at the wheel,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which has filed more than 150 cases against the administration, part of the largest legal effort against an executive branch in U.S. history.\n\nBut the judicial system has been under strain, and the White House has not always abided by court rulings. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump's criticism of the courts, displaying outside their offices posters of judges they want to impeach.\n\nA next big test will be over a proof-of-citizenship voting bill that Trump wants ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe House has passed the SAVE America Act, which would require birth certificates or passports to register to vote in federal elections and a photo ID at the polls. Supporters say it’s needed to crack down on fraud, while critics argue it will shut millions of Americans out of voting because they don’t have citizenship documents readily available.\n\nThe Senate has a majority to pass the measure but not the necessary 60 votes to overcome an expected Democratic-led filibuster.\n\nTrump has vowed executive actions if Congress fails to approve legislation.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump.",

Following the team’s overtime victory over Canada in Milan, the president shared a message congratulating the players and later spoke with them directly as celebrations continued.\n\nDonald Trump congratulated the United States men’s hockey team after its gold medal victory at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, according to the Detroit Free Press. Coach Mike Sullivan said, “The players just had the President on, I don’t know what it was, what do you call it, FaceTime, whatever, in the locker room. He just spoke to the group, expressing how proud he was of the group and congratulating everybody on the win.” Captain Auston Matthews said, “He called and just congratulated us.”\n\nThe United States defeated Canada 2-1 in overtime to secure the gold medal. Sullivan said the game “was an inspiration to our country. I can’t tell you how many texts I’ve received over the last day or so about watch parties at 8 o’clock in the morning. I think from a viewership standpoint, the United States, there were a lot of people paying attention, the President included.” The team was scheduled to return to NHL duties on February 23, and its flight was diverted from New York’s JFK airport to Miami because of a storm in the northeast.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social: “Congratulations to our great U.S.A. Ice Hockey team. THEY WON THE GOLD. WOW!.” He added, “LOTS OF WINNING!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP.” The White House also shared a social media image depicting a bald eagle and a goose following the victory.\n\nThe post followed prior political tensions between the United States and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at the World Economic Forum, “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” After the Olympics, Carney wrote, “You’re coming home with 21 hard-fought Olympic medals.”\n\nOriginally reported by Vritti Johar on Mandatory.com.\n\nThe post Donald Trump Has a Message for Team USA Hockey appeared first on Reality Tea.",

Trump began by saying, “It’s too bad. I hate to see it,” before pivoting to NFL kickoff rule changes. He never directly addressing college football governance.\n\nTrump responded by name-checking teams he “likes,” including Georgia and South Carolina, and praised quarterback Gunner Stockton, who was in the room. He then told the audience Pate had asked how he judges players, which he had not, leaving the original question unanswered.\n\nWhen asked what was discussed, Trump said their conversations are “always” about politics, contradicting Meyer’s prior claim that they discussed football.\n\nAfter briefly mentioning Miami and Indiana’s Curt Cignetti, Pate pivoted to hiring philosophy. Trump launched into a familiar monologue about instincts and staffing decisions.\n\nThe response centered on instincts. Trump then detoured into praise for Herschel Walker, calling him “maybe the greatest player ever.”\n\nThis led to reflections about the Lincoln Bedroom rather than football.\n\nThe final exchange remained general, touching only lightly on sports.\n\nMore:Donald Trump trends after failed Army-Navy coin toss\n\nAs Pate later explained, a planned 30-to 40-minute long interview was cut short due to a scheduling conflict. What remained was largely softballs and tangents with minimal politics, but arguably just as little substantive college football discussion.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "description": "Trump shares statement from Laura Loomer calling on president to kill Netflix deal",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reposted a message calling Michelle Obama a “racist” and ranted against a former high-ranking official in Barack Obama’s administration as he prepares to face Democrats in Congress at the State of the Union address.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Saturday, the president reposted a message from far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer describing the former first lady as an “anti-white racist.” In his own caption, the president took aim at another Black woman in the same administration: former White House adviser Susan Rice.\n\nThreatening Netflix to fire Rice, who serves on the company’s executive board, Trump wrote: “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.”\n\nLoomer’s post was must more extensive and urged the president to kill an upcoming merger between Warner Bros. and Netflix, which the far-right activist feared would expand the Obamas’ influence within both companies. The former president and his wife own a production company, Higher Ground Productions, which produces a variety of content on Neftlix’s platform.\n\nOf the Obamas, Loomer wrote: “[P]ositive messaging of the Democrats' upcoming witch hunts against Trump from Barack Hussein Obama ... and his anti-White racist wife Michelle ... would likely be blasted across all streaming services as the Obamas' Higher Ground Productions continues to grow within Netflix.”\n\nThe two posts came in response to Rice warning that companies seen as guilty of cozying up to the Trump administration would face consequences of their own if Democratic lawmakers retake the House and Senate in midterm elections this fall — along with the White House in 2028.\n\nShe made the comments on a podcast hosted by Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney fired by Trump during his first term.\n\n“If these corporations think that the Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to, you know, play by the old rules, and, you know, say, ‘Oh, never mind. We’ll forgive you for all the people you fired, all the policies and principles you’ve violated, all, you know, the laws you’ve skirted.’ I think they’ve got another thing coming,” Rice said.\n\nTrump’s apparent support for Loomer’s description of Michelle Obama as “racist” comes as he has continues to refuse to apologize for a scandal that enveloped him this month around the posting of a bizarre AI video from his Truth Social account depicting her and her husband as apes.\n\nThe racist depiction of the nation’s first Black president was immediately condemned by politicians on both sides of the aisle, forcing the White House to offer a defense, then walk it back entirely and delete the post.\n\nRepublicans on the Hill were clearly uncomfortable with the video and called its posting a mistake. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican, called it racist.\n\nThe former president responded on a podcast, stating that “it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.\n\nTrump has blamed the post on a staffer who has access his Truth Social account, Natalie Harp, whom he said did not watch the video fully before posting it to his account.\n\nIn a statement to reporters on Air Force One, Trump claimed to have watched part of the video and sent it to his team for review and a possible post on his account. He denied seeing the part of the video where the former president and former first lady appeared.\n\n“I gave it to the people, generally they’d look at the whole thing but I guess somebody didn’t and they posted it. And then we deleted it,” said Trump.\n\nThis isn’t the first time he’s taken content or advice directly from Loomer, either.\n\nThe far-right activist found herself with new access to the Oval Office in 2025 as Trump returned to the White House and used it to direct a purge of figures tied to Michael Waltz, then-Trump’s national security adviser, for supposed disloyalty.\n\nLoomer has also supported a loyalty-driven purge of officials across other parts of the government, with one notable victim being the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. His daughter, Maurene, was fired from the Department of Justice in July.\n\nThrough her constant, vitriolic attacks on Democrats, Loomer has faced her own accusations of racism, including in the fall of 2025, when she was widely condemned for hurling a racist slur at Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett, whom she called a “ghetto Black B****.”",

    "description": "The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Don...",
    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's executive arm requested “full clarity” from the United States and asked its trade partner to fulfill its commitments after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down some of President Donald Trump’s most sweeping tariffs.\n\nTrump has lashed out at the court decision and said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from the 10% he announced a day earlier.\n\nThe European Commission said the current situation is not conducive to delivering \"fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial” trans-Atlantic trade and investment, as agreed to by both sides and spelled out in the EU-U.S. Joint Statement of August 2025.\n\nAmerican and EU officials sealed a trade deal last year that imposes a 15% import tax on 70% of European goods exported to the United States. The European Commission handles trade for the 27 EU member countries.\n\nA top EU lawmaker said on Sunday he will propose to the European Parliament negotiating team to put the ratifying process of the deal on pause.\n\n“Pure tariff chaos on the part of the U.S. administration,” Bernd Lange, the chair of Parliament’s international trade committee, wrote on social media. “No one can make sense of it anymore — only open questions and growing uncertainty for the EU and other U.S. trading partners.”\n\nThe value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.\n\n“A deal is a deal,” the European Commission said. “As the United States’ largest trading partner, the EU expects the U.S. to honor its commitments set out in the Joint Statement — just as the EU stands by its commitments. EU products must continue to benefit from the most competitive treatment, with no increases in tariffs beyond the clear and all-inclusive ceiling previously agreed.\"\n\nHe said he talked to his European counterpart this weekend and hasn’t heard anyone tell him the deal is off.\n\n“The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,” Greer said. “I haven’t heard anyone yet come to me and say the deal’s off. They want to see how this plays out.”\n\nEurope’s biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. Among the biggest U.S. exports to the bloc are professional and scientific services like payment systems and cloud infrastructure, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, aerospace products and cars.\n\n“When applied unpredictably, tariffs are inherently disruptive, undermining confidence and stability across global markets and creating further uncertainty across international supply chains,” the commission added.\n\nAs primarily a trading bloc, the EU has a powerful tool at its disposal to retaliate — the bloc’s Anti-Coercion Instrument. It includes a raft of measures for blocking or restricting trade and investment from countries found to be putting undue pressure on EU member nations or corporations.\n\nThe measures could include curtailing the export and import of goods and services, barring countries or companies from EU public tenders, or limiting foreign direct investment. In its most severe form, it would essentially close off access to the EU’s 450-million customer market and inflict billions of dollars of losses on U.S. companies and the American economy.",

    "description": "After the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations, Christie Brinkley wasted no time in raising her voice.",
    "fullText": "There is no love lost between Christie Brinkley and President Donald Trump, and she is not even subtle about it.\n\nAfter the intentions of Trump's administration on environmental regulations relating to coal and mercury emissions made headlines, the author wasted no time in raising her voice, assigning the blame, and highlighting the negative impacts to ensue.\n\nOne thing Christie Brinkley will not do is watch in silence. She previously expressed her concerns about the issues with the environment when Donald Trump won the presidential elections in 2024.\n\nBrinkley seems distraught about the Trump administration's decision to ease pollution standards for limits on mercury from coal plants, and she has shared a piece of her mind. The author took to social media, writing that this environmental update is set to destroy lives.\n\nShe noted the pressing side effects that will occur, affecting the fragile population, on her Instagram Stories. \"Mercury causes deformities in babies and developmental disorders of the brain!\" she penned over a screenshot of the headline from Interval News.\n\nIn another slide, still on her stories update, she shared a quote which read \"'I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT TO DO TO THEM. I'M ALLOWED TO DESTROY THE COUNTRY.' -Donald Trump 2/20/26.\" To this, she added a footnote praising him for keeping up to the words in the quote.\n\n\"And I must say he is doing a good job of destroying the country,\" the model shared after stating that the regulations not only put babies at risk, but they target adults too, affecting their nervous systems and ultimately causing organ damage. Brinkley claims Trump's decision is at the expense of the citizens and stems from greed.\n\nWhile the Trump administration views rolling back the clean air regulations from an economic standpoint, public health groups and environmental agencies warn that the health of the masses will bear the brunt.\n\nThe announcement was made on Friday, February 20, 2026, stating that it will roll back clean air regulations limiting mercury and hazardous toxins from power plants. They shared that it will boost baseload energy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency explained that easing the pollution standards would alleviate costs for utilities that run older coal plants.\n\nThe effectiveness of this move shines at a time when demand for power is massively increasing, with the expansion of data centers used for artificial intelligence.\n\nBrinkley particularly noted earlier that the administration has set out to undo the environmental protection regulations put in place by Joe Biden's administration. The Swimsuit model added that the effects on the climate and health will surely take a devastating turn as a result.\n\nThe Daily Mail shared that Brinkley wrote on social media, telling her followers that natural disasters and diseases will all intensify if the state of the planet is not placed at the top of a Scale of preference over profits for a handful of greedy corporations.\n\nShe acknowledged that while the effects of climate change are already being felt, working together in prioritizing the environment will go a long way to slow down or ultimately stop the blistering negative effects.\n\nBrinkley called for support from her online community, stating that nature does not have respect for race or skin color, as no one will survive without a healthy biodiverse environment.\n\nThe actress also admitted that the changes will not only affect the current population but also future generations as well. \"For the sake and well-being of our children, action is mandated,\" her words echoed.\n\nBig stars in the music industry like Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, during the 2024 presidential elections. After it was announced that Trump won, Eilish called his victory a \"war on women,\" seemingly referring to his take on female reproductive rights.\n\nQueen of Pop, Madonna, also expressed her views on the outcome of the election, uploading a photo on Instagram showing a cake with the words \"F-ck Trump,\" adding that she stuffed her face with it after the results were announced.\n\nMadonna also shared that she was \"trying to get her head around why a convicted felon, rapist, and bigot was chosen to lead the country because he's good for the economy?\"\n\nCardi B, along with other celebrities such as Christina Applegate and Lili Reinhart, also slammed his election win. The president also faced heat from the media as many voiced out their disappointment with the election results.\n\nBesides Brinkley's concerns with climate change and environmental regulations, she previously spoke out against Donald Trump, claiming that he had flirted with her when he was married to his first wife, Ivanna.\n\nBrinkley is all about effecting change in the environment and saving Mother Earth from devastating ruin. Still, an aspect of her life saw a painful nosedive, and it was not triggered by environmental destruction.\n\nIn her memoir \"Uptown Girl,\" released last year, she recounts the pain she went through when she discovered her fourth marriage had hit the rocks. She detailed how she discovered her ex-husband, Peter Cook, had cheated on her leading to the end of their eight-year marriage.\n\nThe Blast reported that she described the relationship as the \"most tortured relationship\" she ever had. It was revealed to her that her then-husband was having an affair with a teenage girl.\n\nUpon searching their family computer, she further discovered some incriminating proof and adult content, as well as several explicit photos. The shock she felt was overwhelming when her eyes were met with the truth, and she ultimately decided the union could not continue.\n\nWill Christie Brinkley's voice cause a positive turnaround for the environment?",

    "description": "Tariffs have already added roughly 0.7% to core inflation through January.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect prices at the store to fall just because the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nAt best, companies may slow the pace of future price hikes on goods that get tariff relief. But they're unlikely to cut prices outright, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note published Sunday.\n\n\"We would not expect companies to lower prices in response to tariff reductions nearly as quickly as they increased them in response to tariff increases,\" the economists wrote.\n\nThe bank estimates tariff passthrough has already lifted core Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, by about 0.7% through January. It expects only an additional 0.1% increase over the rest of 2026.\n\nFriday's 6-3 Supreme Court ruling scrapped tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The White House quickly announced a 10% Section 122 tariff and then raised it to 15% the next day.\n\nThe shift would bring the increase in the effective tariff rate since the start of 2025 down from just over 10 percentage points to about 9 percentage points, Goldman estimates, leaving its inflation outlook little changed.\n\nOn economic growth, Goldman said imports from countries that see meaningful tariff reductions, particularly China, should rebound in the coming months.\n\nBut that likely won't give the economy much of a lift. Any rebound in imports from China would be offset by companies restocking shelves after earlier frontloading, trade reshuffling, and small declines in imports from higher-tariff countries.\n\nGoldman estimates first-quarter 2026 GDP growth at 3.4%, though that includes a temporary boost from the end of the 2025 government shutdown. It continues to forecast 2.5% growth by the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\nFriday's ruling also sets up a fight over roughly $180 billion in tariffs already collected.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would ever see refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas, adding that the administration has other tools to reimpose tariffs and that sorting out any repayment could take years.",

    "description": "The president now routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply.",
    "fullText": "Netflix wants President Donald Trump's stamp of approval as it maneuvers to buy Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNow, Trump has a demand for Netflix: unseat board member Susan Rice.\n\nIn normal times, we would all be marveling at the spectacle of the US president telling a company in the midst of a merger fight (Paramount also wants to buy Warner Bros. Discovery) how to structure its board. During Trump 2.0, though, this has become standard stuff. Trump routinely tells companies to fire someone he doesn't like or do something he does like.\n\nThat doesn't mean Trump always gets what he wants. The demands alone, however, are an extraordinary use of power. We should make sure we don't become inured to it.\n\nTrump's Truth Social post is a reminder that the future of Warner Bros. Discovery will run through the White House, no matter what Trump says at any given moment. (Refresher: In December, Trump said, \"I'll be involved\" in the fight between Netflix and Paramount. Earlier this month, he announced that \"I've decided I shouldn't be involved.\" Now he's telling Netflix it will \"pay the consequences\" if it doesn't fire Rice, which sure seems like he's involved again.)\n\nTrump himself doesn't have the authority to stop Warner Bros. Discovery from selling itself to Netflix or Paramount, which is controlled by David Ellison and his father, the prominent Trump supporter, Larry Ellison. He can, however, instruct Attorney General Pam Bondi to sue to stop a deal on antitrust grounds.\n\nModern presidents have traditionally assumed an arm's-length distance from federal law enforcement. And it's entirely possible that any other president's Department of Justice would also look into an antitrust case against Netflix, given its enormous market power.\n\nTrump, however, has made it clear that he expects Bondi to act on his behalf. So if he doesn't want Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, he can certainly make it more difficult for them.\n\nWhich makes it puzzling that Rice, who held senior roles in the Clinton, Obama, and Biden administrations, would sound off on a podcast, announcing that \"elites\" and \"corporate interests\" who accommodated Trump would one day \"be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nThis wasn't a mere gaffe or misstatement. She went on at length. It was, regardless of how she intended it, a provocation aimed at the Trump White House — at the exact moment the company she's supposed to help govern is seeking Trump's approval.\n\nI've asked Netflix for comment on Rice's comments and Trump's response.\n\nWe should also note that Trump's most consistent trait is his inconsistency and that he frequently reverses himself. Last summer, for instance, he announced that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan was \"highly CONFLICTED\" and must resign. Days later, Trump met with Tan and described him as a \"success.\" Weeks after that, the US government acquired 10% of Intel.\n\nNor does Trump always follow through. Last fall, he demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, an executive who had also worked for Clinton, Obama, and Biden. Monaco still works for Microsoft.\n\nHowever, just because we don't know how serious Trump is about pushing Rice out of Netflix — or how his administration will ultimately rule on the Netflix/Paramount race — doesn't mean we should shrug this off.\n\nWe're in a place where the president routinely tells companies how to run their businesses and threatens them if they don't comply. If we get used to that, we shouldn't be surprised when future presidents decide they can do it, too.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "description": "General Caine warned Trump an attack on Iran would be \"far more difficult\" than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is weighing options to avoid a major military conflict with Iran if the country does not ditch its nuclear program after General Dan “Raizin” Caine told him an attack would be “far more difficult” than the operation that captured Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, The New York Times reported on Sunday evening.\n\nThe report said Trump and key members of his administration are heading to Geneva on Thursday to meet with Iranian negotiators; the meeting appears to be a “last-ditch” effort to avoid a military conflict.\n\n“President Trump has told advisers that if diplomacy or any initial targeted U.S. attack does not lead Iran to give in to his demands that it give up its nuclear program, he will consider a much bigger attack in coming months intended to drive that country’s leaders from power,” the report said, based on “people briefed on internal administration deliberations.”\n\nThe Times story has four reporters on the byline — Julian E. Barnes, David E. Sanger, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt.\n\nMembers of Trump’s team and on the Iranian side are both considering an “off-ramp to military conflict,” which would include a “very limited nuclear enrichment program” that would only be used for medical research, the report said. That is because some members of the administration have expressed “doubts” a full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program occur, if the U.S. only conducts airstrikes.\n\nHere is a key section on Caine warning Trump that attacking Iran could be harder than first expected:\n\nDuring the discussions of the operation last month to seize President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, General Caine told Mr. Trump there was a high likelihood of success. But General Caine has not been able to deliver the same reassurances to Mr. Trump during the Iran discussions, in large measure because it is a far more difficult target.\n\n[Vice President JD] Vance, who has long called for more restraint in overseas military action, did not oppose a strike, but he intensely questioned General Caine and Mr. Ratcliffe in the meeting. He pressed them to share their opinions of the options and wanted more of a discussion of the risks and complexity of carrying out a strike against Iran.\n\nThe report comes a few days after CBS senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs reported top military officials told Trump the military is ready for a potential strike as soon as this weekend. And Axios’s Barak Ravid reported on February 18 that “a U.S. military operation in Iran would likely be a massive, weeks-long campaign that would look more like full-fledged war than last month’s pinpoint operation in Venezuela, sources say.”\n\nAll of this comes amid months of protests against Iran’s theocratic regime inside the country.\n\nThe Times report added Trump is leaving open the possibility for a “military assault later this year intended to help topple Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It appears this could go a number of ways heading into the big summit this Thursday.\n\nThe post US Mulling an ‘Off Ramp’ On Iran As Top General Advises Trump Iran Attack Would Be ‘Far More Difficult’ Than Venezuela: NYT first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of ...",
    "fullText": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (AP) — Over and over, the Republicans and former Republicans who gathered just outside Washington this weekend warned that President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress are tearing at the very fabric of American democracy.\n\nA former congressman described the president's party as an “authoritarian-embracing cult.” A prominent conservative writer said Trumpism is an \"existential threat.\" And a retired Army general, his voice shaking with emotion, cited post-Nazi Germany as a roadmap for the nation's post-Trump recovery.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are listening.\n\nThe main convention hall at the sixth annual Principles First summit on Saturday and Sunday was half empty. About 750 chairs were set up in a room that could have fit thousands, and many were unfilled. Not a single current Republican elected official participated in the two-day program.\n\nThis is what remains of the Grand Old Party’s Never Trump movement, a coalition of Republicans, former Republicans and independents who banded together as Trump consolidated power. They largely remain political exiles — not quite at home among Democrats yet disgusted by how the president has abandoned Republicans' longstanding commitments to free trade and limited government.\n\nJohn McDowell, 69, who was a lifelong Republican before Trump’s emergence, acknowledged that the diminished group had virtually “zero” political clout within his former party.\n\n“It’s just a fact. We’re losing good people,” said McDowell, a former Capitol Hill staffer and county Republican official from San Carlos, California. “The party is becoming more and more MAGA-fied.”\n\nWhite House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed all the criticism from what she called “a bunch of deranged has-been politicians.”\n\n“The only people who will pay attention to this event are the journalists who are forced to cover it,” she said.\n\nVirtually everyone who gathered at the hotel in National Harbor, Maryland, said they are rooting for Democratic victories in this fall's midterm elections. One of the only Democrats there was Conor Lamb, a former congressman from Pennsylvania who lost his party's primary to John Fetterman four years ago.\n\nDespite dire concerns, there was a slight sense of optimism among the half-empty convention hall and quiet hotel hallways.\n\nSeveral people cheered last week’s Supreme Court decision to strike down Trump’s tariffs, the economic tool he has wielded without congressional approval in his attempt to force friends and foes around the globe to bend to his will. Trump insisted he would implement a new round of tariffs despite the ruling.\n\nFormer New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former Trump adviser, highlighted recent AP-NORC polling showing that 1 in 4 Republicans nationwide do not approve of Trump's job performance.\n\n“It’s like any show that’s on TV for a long time — the ratings start to go down. And the ratings are going down,” Christie said. “I am willing to bet you that by next February, this room is going to be twice the size of what it is now. After the midterms, you watch.”\n\nEx-MAGA diehard Rich Logis, wearing a red “I left MAGA hat,” hopes to see “an electoral revolt against MAGA” in the midterms.\n\n“I think there’s a shift in our country right now,\" he said. \"It happens slowly.\"\n\nLogis was promoting support groups for friends and family of Trump loyalists at a table outside the convention hall. Nearby, someone was selling books about how to escape cults.\n\nAt the podium, former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh implored Trump's critics not to downplay the seriousness of the threat the president poses to the nation.\n\n“He’s everything our founders feared. Say it. Believe it,” Walsh said. He said his former party is “an authoritarian-embracing cult\" and \"a threat to everything I love.”\n\nRetired Gen. Mark Hertling, who once commanded the U.S. Army's European forces, said he's “haunted” by allies who ask him “whether American institutions ever can be trusted again.”\n\n“Our nation's institutions have been shaken. Our alliances have been strained. Our credibility has been damaged. And our nation’s values have been cast aside,” Hertling said. He suggested the U.S. should look to the reconstruction of Germany after the defeat of Nazism if it hoped to to restore the damage caused by Trump and his allies.\n\nThe nation's recovery, he said as his voiced cracked, would be something people have to earn over many years.\n\nBill Kristol, who worked in previous Republican administrations and helped found the Weekly Standard magazine, described Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress as “an existential threat” to the nation. But he was also optimistic about the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nKristol said Democrats are “almost certain to win the House,” “could possibly win the Senate,” and have “a good chance to win the presidency” in 2028.\n\nBrittany Martinez, executive director of the host organization Principles First, also tried to cast an optimistic tone, even after describing the many reasons why she couldn't bear to continue her career as a Republican staffer on Capitol Hill.\n\n“I hope that Republicans continue to wake up,” she said. “I do think that those folks exist. And I hope that they exist in greater numbers.”",

    "description": "Uros Medic had an important phone call with Donald Trump",
    "fullText": "Uros Medic may have cleared one major hurdle in his quest to headline a UFC event in his home country.\n\nUFC Houston proved to be a banner show for Medic, who scored a nasty first-round knockout of Geoff Neal in Saturday’s co-main event. Afterwards, Medic called for a fight with former welterweight champion Leon Edwards and for it to take place in Medic’s native Serbia.\n\nHowever, Medic admitted immigration issues have prevented him from leaving the United States and implored President Donald Trump to help clear up the situation.\n\n“I got one little problem,” Medic said. “Immigration’s been holding me up and I can’t travel just yet. So this is my plea for help. Mr. President, if you can see this, please, we’ve got to go to Belgrade, Serbia, for the UFC this summer.”\n\nAccording to Medic, his plea did not fall on deaf ears, as UFC CEO Dana White later invited him to his office to speak to Trump personally. Trump assured Medic that his immigration issues will be taken care of.\n\n“As an immigrant it’s a little hard getting things done,” Medic said. “I know how busy they are, almost everyone in the world wants to live in the United States so immigration, it is hard. They have a lot of work to do and my case has been kind of backed up and not moving, so I was just waiting and waiting and waiting and at one point, I mean, I probably could have mentioned before I’ve been five years in the UFC, five years there was no changes. I have work permit, I’m allowed to work, there was travel documents for me to travel. I never felt safe using them because there was COVID and all this bullshit. So I never used them and I didn’t travel, so at this point I was already at the end of my patience and I had to say something and I think it was a perfect opportunity to speak my mind about it. Again, not wanting to knock them down or talk anything bad about them, I know they’re all trying to do their jobs, but I have to use the position that I’m at and I had to mention it because it’s been hard not being able to travel home.\n\n“Little did I know I get back, a phone call with Dana White, I’m back in his office, and Dana’s got President Donald Trump on speakerphone and I was just standing there, I cannot believe what’s happening. He said, ‘You’re good to go wherever you please. Just give Dana the documentation information that you need’ and I’m just blown away.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much more bureaucracy Medic actually has to deal with so that he can return home and potentially help White arrange a UFC event in Serbia’s capital, but he was heartened by his conversation with the president, whose wife Melania hails from nearby Slovenia.\n\n“It was just amazing for me to tell him about the situation and how big of a fan I am of him and obviously his wife was from where I’m from,” Medic said. “Considering where I’m from, even though it’s a different country, it’s like a five-hour drive, that’s nothing for America. You can’t even get out of Texas in five hours.\n\n“I’m still processing all of it. Dana just made my dreams come true for the second time. Third time. First, was to get signed; second, was to go into the top 15; now, I just got to speak with Mr. President on the phone and he said I’m good to travel. My stuff is done, so it’s going to take a minute for me to just process this. A lot has happened in the past hour.”",

    "description": "Trump watches the polls but this is one he might want to skip.",
    "fullText": "It is no secret that Donald Trump keeps his eyes on polling numbers, but there is one that CNN highlighted this week that he will probably want to skip.\n\nBut it also might benefit him to look at it heading into the mid-terms because it just isn’t pretty for the president. And that is because, just a month after Kamala Harris was hit with an embarrassing low on the betting markets as far as her 2028 presidency hopes are concerned, she is now crushing Trump in a new NBC poll that looked back at the 2024 election.\n\n“Regrets … some folks had a few,” CNN data guru Harry Enten said pulling up the results on a screen during the segment.\n\nTrump won the election in Nov. 2024 by just more than a point and a half, per Enten, but in April of 2025 Harris had pulled ahead of him by a point among those polled about recasting their vote.\n\nAnd now she is ahead by a whopping eight points.\n\n“Kamala Harris wins in a redo, asking folks essentially if you could redo the 2024 election, how would you vote?” Enten explained. “She wins it by, get this, eight points. A massive shift from what we saw back in November of 2024 when Donald Trump won by a point, and I will note that this sample was weighted to the 2024 result in which Donald Trump won by a point. And yet Kamala Harris in this weighted sample, she wins by eight amongst the sample that voted for Trump by one.”\n\nEnten then explained how this could signal a swing come mid-terms.\n\n“It has a massive impact on voter sentiment about what may happen late this year,” he said. “Why do I say that? Because let’s take a look at the vote for Congress and this is very important. The 2024 Harris voters, they vote for the Democrats on average by get this, 89 points. The Trump voters vote for Republicans by 83 points.\n\n“This means that the Democratic base that voted for Kamala Harris is sticking with those congressional Democratic candidates more than the Trump voters are sticking with the Republican candidates,” he added. “ And that is why what you are seeing on that generic congressional ballot at this point is Democrats leaping ahead by about five points because the Trump voters are not sticking by Republicans as much as the Harris voters are sticking by the Democrats.”\n\nThe polling got uglier when individuals who didn’t vote in 2024 were added in.\n\n“It’s also people coming off the sideline, OK,” he said looking at the date for voters’ choice in the 2026 congressional elections if they didn’t vote in 2024. “Look at this. Democrats are winning that vote by a significant margin, by 16 percentage points. So you add on to that, the Harris voters sticking with the Democratic candidates, suddenly, you see hey, this is the way the Democrats are going to get back their congressional majority.”",

    "fullText": "Most critics of President Donald Trump view him as the ultimate threat to American democracy. But to Nobel prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu, Trump’s merely a fever, the result of an infection that’s been brewing for years before he rode down the golden escalator to announce his presidency.\n\nThe MIT economist has spent decades studying the origins of economic and political decay, specializing in how institutions foster inclusive growth—or succumb to extractive systems. In the 2012 book Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Acemoglu and co-writer James A. Robinson argue that nations proper because of their political institutions. In 2024, Acemoglu won the Nobel Prize in economics, alongside Robinson and Simon Johnson, for demonstrating how political and economic institutions shape prosperity.\n\nHow do experts differ on AI's job impact?\n\nWhat is Acemoglu's 'pro-worker' AI development approach?\n\nWhy does Acemoglu view Trump as symptom, not cause?\n\nHow could AI-driven inequality threaten American democracy?\n\nAcemoglu argued that while Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are weakening the country’s institutions, the president is not the root cause of the broader structural problems. He warned the country is headed down a grim path and outlined two shifts relative to AI development he sees as critical to avoiding deeper decline: cracking down on economic inequality and tempering job destruction. “If we go down this path of destroying jobs [and] creating more inequality, U.S. democracy is not going to survive,” he told Fortune.\n\nOne: The proliferation of economic inequality\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, AI-driven job displacement could be catastrophic and further entrench inequality. He notes the U.S. is currently seeing unprecedented levels of wealth inequality, and traditional policy has failed to close the gap. “We may need wealth taxes because anything else we do today is still going to lead to this huge wealth gap that exists in this country.”\n\nThe economist pointed to California’s proposed “billionaire tax,” a ballot initiative which would impose a one-time 5% wealth tax on all individuals in the state with a net worth of $1 billion or more. But even that doesn’t go far enough, according to the economist. “It’s not enough to tax the rich,” he said. “You really need ways in which workers of all sorts of skills can take part in the growth process.”\n\nBut AI proponents say Acemoglu’s diagnosis of AI development is counterintuitive. Adam Thierer, senior fellow at the think tank R Street Institute and longtime advocate for technological innovation, believes AI will spawn opportunities, driving the economy into the future. “The way we get new and better jobs and opportunities is through technological improvements in society and our economy,” Thierer told Fortune.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump oddly posted a video of CNN’s Kaitlan Collins — the woman he has dubbed “the worst reporter” — discussing the enormous new banner bearing his visage that she claimed has “erased” the line between the White House and the Department of Justice.\n\nWork crews used a cherry picker to erect the banner over the entrance to the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to miss the the new banner bearing President Trump’s face that just went up here at the Justice Department,” Collins said. “If you’ve been in Washington in recent months you’ve seen similar ones at the Department of Labor or the Department of Agriculture for example, but this one seems to strike a different chord given it’s the Department of Justice.”\n\n“Historically, administrations have tried to stress a level of independence between the West Wing and the White House and their Justice Department, arguing that politics doesn’t influence who is being prosecuted,” Collins continued. “But it’s safe to say that line has been erased since President Trump has taken office in his second term. We’ve seen him directly pressure the Attorney General to prosecute people who he perceives as his political enemies, or people who have led prosecutions against him. The Justice Department said this banner is in honor of America’s upcoming 250th birthday celebration, but if you look at this banner closely, it also echoes what President Trump himself has said, talking about the slogan, ‘Make America Safe Again.'”\n\nEarlier this month, Trump called Collins “the worst reporter” who never smiles, after she asked a question about the victims of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nWhen Collins asked, “What would you say to the survivors–” Trump interrupted.\n\n“You are so bad, you know? You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN has no ratings, because of people like you. You know, she’s a young woman. I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face–”\n\nWatch the video on Truth Social here.\n\nThe post Trump Oddly Posts Video of CNN Rival Kaitlan Collins Claiming His Giant Banner at the DOJ Symbolizes ‘Erased’ Separation of Powers first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has demanded that Netflix remove former US ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, stepping up his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning with Trump. Speaking on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast published Thursday, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and skirt the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\n\"There is likely to be a swing in the other direction,\" and these companies are \"going to be caught with more than their pants down,\" Rice said.\" They're going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.\"\n\nRice, a Democrat, has a long career in US foreign and domestic policy, working under Democratic presidents.\n\nShe served in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 2001, including roles at the National Security Council and as assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.\n\nUnder Obama, Rice served as US ambassador to the UN, becoming the second-youngest person at 44 and the first Black woman to represent the US at the UN. She later served as head of the Domestic Policy Council under Biden.\n\nShe was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from Stanford with a degree in history. She worked in management consulting for McKinsey and Company before entering government.\n\nRice has previously faced criticism from the right. In her 2019 memoir, \"Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\" she wrote that she was a frequent \"villain\" for conservative media.\n\nAfter the 2012 killing of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans accused her of misleading the public in interviews discussing the attacks. She was later cleared by subsequent investigations.\n\nShe also faced scrutiny by Trump and his allies for \"unmasking\" senior Trump officials to understand why the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates was in New York in 2016.\n\nUnmasking is when senior government officials ask to learn the identity of a US citizen whose name has been withheld in intelligence reports about communications, such as intercepted calls. In some situations, national security officials argue that knowing the person's identity is necessary to interpret and assess the intelligence information.\n\nAs UN Ambassador, Rice supported US intervention against Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nRice has written op-eds supportive of the Biden administration and accusing Trump of undermining democracy. In a 2025 column in The New York Times, Rice accused members of Trump's national security team of \"reckless negligence\" after they discussed sensitive national security matters on Signal.\n\nDisclosure: Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, is a Netflix board member.",

    "fullText": "From a purely data-based standpoint, the stock market has been practically unstoppable with Donald Trump in the White House. Although there have been periods of historic volatility, such as the five-week COVID-19 crash in February-March 2020, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and technology-driven Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first term.\n\nThe stock market's outperformance has continued since President Trump's second, non-consecutive term began on Jan. 20, 2025, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq climbing by 14%, 15%, and 16%, respectively, as of the closing bell on Feb. 18, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nThis Trump bull market has been fueled by an assortment of factors, such as the rise of artificial intelligence and the advent of quantum computing, as well as policies and proposals directly linked to Trump.\n\nFor example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Trump's flagship tax and spending law from his first term) permanently lowered the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the lowest level since 1939. With businesses keeping more of their income, it's led to record share buybacks from S&P 500 companies -- more than $1 trillion estimated for 2025. Share repurchases can increase earnings per share for public companies with steady or growing net income.\n\nAlthough the Trump bull market may appear infallible, several headwinds are threatening to pull the rug out from beneath it. While some of these catalysts are well known, such as tariff-related uncertainty and historically high stock valuations, the eventual undoing of the Trump bull market may be a surprise culprit: the Federal Reserve.\n\nNormally, the Federal Reserve is Wall Street's financial bedrock. It's America's foremost financial institution tasked with maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. It achieves these goals by adjusting the federal funds target rate -- the overnight lending rate between financial institutions -- and/or conducting open-market operations, such as buying or selling U.S. Treasury bonds. It's a straightforward task guided by copious amounts of economic data.",

    "fullText": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is curious as to why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" and agreed to curb its nuclear programme, as Washington builds up its military capability ‌in the Middle East, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said.\n\n\"I don't want to use the ‌word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use ​the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated,\" Witkoff said during an interview on Saturday with Fox News' \"My View with Lara Trump,\" hosted by the president's daughter-in-law.\n\n\"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's ‌what we're prepared to do'? And ⁠yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place.\"\n\nTrump has ordered a huge buildup of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week ⁠air attack on Iran. Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases if it is attacked.\n\nIRAN DENIES SEEKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\nThe United States wants Iran to give up enriched uranium which Washington says can potentially be used to make a ​bomb, as ​well as stop supporting militants in the Middle East ​and accept limits to its missile programme.\n\nTehran ‌says its nuclear programme is peaceful but it is willing to accept some curbs on it in return for the lifting of financial sanctions. It rejects tying this to other issues such as missiles and support for armed groups.\n\n\"They've been enriching well beyond the number that you need for civil nuclear. It's up to 60% (fissile purity),\" Witkoff said. \"They're probably a week away from having industrial, industrial-grade bomb-making material, and that's really ‌dangerous.\"\n\nA senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Iran ​and the United States still have differing views over sanctions relief ​in talks.\n\nWitkoff also said he has met ​at Trump's direction with Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi, son of the shah ousted ‌in Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He did ​not provide further details of ​the meeting.\n\nPahlavi, who lives in exile, served as a rallying figure for some of Iran's opposition during anti-government demonstrations last month in which thousands of people are believed to have been killed, ​the worst domestic unrest since the ‌revolution era.\n\nEarlier in February, Pahlavi said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives, and ​urged Washington not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear ​deal.",

    "description": "US President unveiled Project Vault, a strategic critical mineral reserve. The initiative highlights an underlying inflation pressures.",
    "fullText": "Commodities had a wild ride last year, and it's continued so far in 2026. Trump's new Project Vault could be a sign of more volatility to come.\n\nThe Trump administration's new critical mineral reserve is meant to secure supply and protect from major price moves, but experts have raised concerns that the reality is that it could ratchet up volatility and be a fresh input for more inflation.\n\nTrump announced Project Vault on February 2, establishing the US Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve.\n\n\"Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we are now creating this reserve for American industry,\" Trump read in an Oval Office announcement.\n\nThe $12 billion reserve is funded by a $10 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of the United States and $2 billion in private financing.\n\n\"This is the first time in the history of the United States we've ever stockpiled minerals for our civilian economy,\" David Copley, a White House official, said.\n\nGE Vernova, Western Digital, and Boeing are some of the private companies expected to participate in the project.\n\nProject Vault may pose some risk to the commodity market, but the details remain unclear, and that makes pricing in the risk more difficult for investors.\n\nFGS Global strategists noted that the implementation details are \"critical,\" especially given Trump's tariff policy and ongoing trade negotiations.\n\n\"Project Vault's top-line priority — fostering the resilience of critical minerals supply chains — is open to several competing interpretations, each with radically different approaches,\" partners at Latham & Watkins said.\n\n\"This is essentially about taking steps to redesign the market architecture for critical minerals,\" international trade lawyer Sahar Hafeez said. \"Which minerals are prioritized, how a price floor is calculated, and who signs on—those are the critical next steps.\"\n\nThe Project Vault reserve is expected to impact on supply and demand dynamics and commodity price moves.\n\nJefferies' analyst, Chris LaFemina, said Project Vault's planned reserve would represent only 1% to 3% of global supply, but flags that stockpiling the US is one of many global powers stockpiling, which threatens to fuel inflationary pressures for commodities and the materials sector.\n\nThe analyst highlighted that the $12 billion reserve, unlike the existing oil preserve Trump compared it to, will cost roughly $1 billion annually to maintain. He says this ultimately pushes prices higher, which is felt by consumers in the end.\n\n\"So is it inflationary? I mean, look, inflation is driven by a lot of different factors, but this, in and of itself, I think, could potentially become a major inflationary problem,\" LaFemina said in a video posted by the firm this month.\n\nLaFemina expects that the recent upward trend in metals will continue, along with \"significant\" volatility.\n\nGoldman pointed out that Trump's policies shift commodity markets supply-demand balance to be regionally segmented rather than globally, creating a heightened volatility risk.\n\nThey flagged copper as an early example, explaining that prices firmed despite volatility in 2025, as US stockpiling left the rest of the market in deficit amid global oversupply.\n\nThe reserve comes during the Trump administration's efforts to turbocharge the American manufacturing industry and reduce economic reliance on China.\n\nCommodities like silver, copper, and platinum, some of the 60 USGS critical minerals, have seen dramatic price moves recently. Project Vault is intended to insulate American firms from this volatility and safeguard US interests by reducing reliance on China.\n\nCritical minerals, specifically rare earth minerals, have been a key sticking point of US-China trade talks. China is a dominant player at every stage of the critical minerals industry, from mining to refining, meaning it has a lot of control over pricing.\n\nGoldman Sachs believes that Project Vault's stockpiling will focus on these rare earth minerals.\n\nTrade negotiations and unclear supply sourcing are among the other uncertainties that could feed market volatility.\n\nFGS Global strategists said some of the tariffs expected from the administration may \"amplify commodity price volatility,\" adding that the ongoing trade negotiations could stand in the way of a regional critical mineral deal. Trade talks between the US, Mexico, and Canada are set to conclude in July.\n\nAnother consideration is China could restrict supply in response to the US' plans to stockpile. The Trump administration hasn't explained sourcing plans.\n\nJefferies lead metals and mining analyst, LaFemina, said.\n\n\"Sourcing remains unclear, in the interim the US may have to buy from suppliers it's trying to avoid (ie. China).\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is calling on Netflix to remove former US Ambassador and national security advisor Susan Rice from its board, sharpening his criticism of the streaming giant as it seeks to merge with Warner Bros. Discovery amid antitrust scrutiny.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump demanded that Netflix \"immediately terminate\" Rice from its board of directors, \"or pay the consequences,\" amplifying a message from right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Loomer had urged action against Rice, criticizing her role at the company and pointing to recent remarks she made about Trump and corporate America.\n\nRice, who served in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, recently warned companies against aligning themselves too closely with Trump. Speaking on Thursday on the \"Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara\" podcast, she said corporations that \"take a knee\" to the president and break the law should expect consequences, predicting an \"accountability agenda\" if Democrats take back power.\n\nThe clash comes as the streaming giant pursues a high-stakes merger that will require approval from the Department of Justice's antitrust division.\n\nTrump in December said that Netflix had a \"very big market share,\" so its potential acquisition of Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\"\n\nHowever, in February, he said he \"shouldn't be involved\" in the deal and would defer to his Department of Justice to investigate the proposed merger, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nEarlier this week, during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast, Netflix's co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, said that Trump hadn't asked for political concessions during discussions of the possible deal, but was focused on bringing jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.\n\nRepresentatives for Netflix and Rice did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump called on Netflix to fire one of its board members, Susan Rice, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser, following comments she made about accountability when Democrats return to power.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social Saturday, “Netflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences. She’s got no talent or skills – Purely a political hack! HER POWER IS GONE, AND WILL NEVER BE BACK. How much is she being paid, and for what??? Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nTrump Indicates He’s Really Not Into Netflix Buying WB, Wants To Stop The Streamer’s So-Called “Cultural Takeover”\n\n'Real Time': Bill Maher Responds To Trump's Truth Social Rant, Jokes POTUS Expected Him To \"Put Out\" After Dinner\n\nA Netflix spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThis week, Rice appeared on Preet Bharara’s podcast and said that, for corporate interests, law firms and media, “it is not going to end well for them. For those that decided that they would act in their perceived, very narrow self interest, which I would underscore as very short-term self-interest, and take a knee to Trump, I think they are now starting to realize, ‘Wait a minute, this is not popular. Trump is not popular.'”\n\nShe said that “there is likely to be a swing in the other direction, and they are going to be caught with more than their pants down. They are going to be held accountable by those who come in opposition to Trump and win at the ballot box.”\n\nShe added, “If these corporations think that Democrats, when they come back in power, are going to play by the old rules, and say, ‘Never mind, we will forgive you for all the people you fired and all the policies and principles you violated, all the laws you skirted,’ I think they got another thing coming.”\n\nReferring to Democrats, she said, “We are not going to play by the old set of rules when these guys are playing by a different set of rules. We are going to play by the law. We are not going to violate the law like they did. But we are not going to be suckers.”\n\nTrump linked to a post from Laura Loomer, who has for months lashed out at Netflix along with other MAGA influencers against the streaming giant’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros., citing in part the its ties to Barack Obama. Rice served as U.S. ambassador the the United Nations in Obama’s first term and national security adviser in his second.\n\nTrump told NBC News earlier this month that he would not be involved in deciding whether his administration will give regulatory approval to a Netflix-Warner Bros. deal or a competing bid from Paramount for all of Warner Bros. Discovery. But he previously said he would be involved, despite the long-held political norm of presidents keeping at arms’ length from the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has publicly offered praise for Ted Sarandos, the Netflix co-CEO, after meeting with him multiple times, including at a White House visit in November.\n\nSarandos appeared before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee at a hearing earlier this month, where he was pressed on the competitive impact of the transaction. But several Republicans on the committee pressed Sarandos on culture war issues, including content featuring transgender individuals, even though the DOJ is reviewing the merger for antitrust issues.\n\nParamount, meanwhile, has ties to Trump that include his longtime friend and investor, Larry Ellison, and his son, Skydance founder and the merged company’s CEO, David Ellison. Paramount’s chief legal officer, Makan Delrahim, led the DOJ antitrust division during Trump’s first term.\n\nRice’s point — that Democrats will hold companies accountable if they regain power — was underscored this week when a group of senators fired off a letter to David Ellison, asking him to preserve documents after he declined to answer questions about Paramount’s dealings with Trump.\n\nNetflix should fire racist, Trump Deranged Susan Rice, IMMEDIATELY, or pay the consequences.

After that, Congress must vote to extend.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to that 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nThe president's Truth Social post on Saturday, while short on details, indicated he would raise that tariff to 15%.\n\nThe IEEPA-justified tariffs have been among Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements worldwide. They included Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\n\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" the president wrote in his Truth Social post on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the FCC, wants TV broadcasters to rally around the American flag in celebration of the U.S.’s 250th anniversary this year — suggesting that, for example, local stations could start “each broadcast day” with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nOn Friday, Carr announced the Pledge America Campaign, which he framed as part of the White House’s Salute to America 250 Task Force agenda, which “invites citizens to have a renewed love of American history, experience the beauty of our country, and ignite a spirit of adventure and innovation that will raise our nation to new heights over the next 250 years.”\n\nBrendan Carr Confirms FCC Has Begun 'Enforcement Proceedings' Against ABC's 'The View' Over Equal Time Issues\n\nCBS 'Censorship' of Stephen Colbert Slammed by Democratic FCC Commissioner as Latest 'Corporate Capitulation' to Trump Administration\n\nFCC Chairman Says There Are 'Legitimate Competition Concerns' With Netflix's Warner Bros. Deal - but His Agency Has No Authority to Review It\n\nAccording to the FCC, Carr is “heeding this call” put forth by the Trump White House with the Pledge America Campaign, which “enables broadcasters to lend their voices in support of Task Force 250 and the celebration of America’s 250th birthday by airing patriotic, pro-America content that celebrates the American journey and inspires its citizens by highlighting the historic accomplishments of this great nation from our founding through the Trump Administration today.”\n\nThe agency’s announcement comes as Carr has said he wants to help local TV stations push back against national networks on the amount reverse compensation that they pay for programming.\n\nCarr also has taken an aggressive stance in applying the FCC’s rules to fight against what he sees as pro-left bias in some national network programming. That has included his threat to investigate local broadcasters for “news distortion” if they aired “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Carr also has said the FCC “equal time” rule for political candidates will apply to daytime and late-night shows that are deemed to not be “bona fide” news programs. The FCC is investigating ABC’s “The View” for a possible violation of the equal-time rule after Texas politician James Talarico, who is running for the U.S. Senate, appeared on the show. This past Monday, Stephen Colbert said CBS lawyers blocked “The Late Show” from airing his interview with Talarico over concern that it would trigger the FCC equal-time rule.\n\nCarr, in a statement Friday, said, “The White House is leading our national celebration of this historic event with the Salute to America 250 Task Force, which calls on the federal government, among others, to mark this momentous occasion. As part of this effort, I am calling on broadcasters to pledge to provide programming that promotes civic education, national pride and our shared history.”\n\nCarr continued, “This type of programming is more relevant than ever, as surveys show that civics education is in rapid decline. And classic programming such as ‘Schoolhouse Rock!’ is now only found in online archives. Broadcasters are uniquely positioned to help address these concerning developments by providing programming that celebrates the remarkable story of American Independence while also tailoring it to the specific needs of their local communities, in furtherance of their public interest obligations.”\n\nThe FCC’s GOP chairman also provided examples of “nonpartisan” celebratory pro-American programming:\n\nRunning PSAs, short segments or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history\n\nIncluding segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites\n\nStarting each broadcast day with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance\n\nAiring music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington or George Gershwin\n\nProviding daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events that took place on that day in history\n\nPartnering with community organizations and other groups that are already working hard to bring America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Friday said the quickest way to have President Trump act on tariffs “is to tell him that he can’t,” after the Supreme Court ruled that his use of emergency powers to enact his sweeping tariff agenda was unconstitutional.\n\nThe high court’s 6-3 ruling invalidated Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep import taxes on almost all foreign trading partners. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the IEEPA does not apply to the tariffs.\n\nSanders, in an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich, said the court’s ruling was “not only disappointing” but “I think it’s wrong.”\n\n“I think Justice [Clarence] Thomas was exactly right,” she continued. “The Constitution grants the president this authority. “But ultimately, I don’t think it matters. One of the things I love about Donald Trump is that the fastest way to get him to do something is to tell him that he can’t. And he has so many tools in his toolbox.”\n\nThe GOP governor added that Trump will “use whatever tool and resource he needs to get that job done.”\n\n“And while this may, you know, take over the news cycle for a few days, I don’t think it changes what the outcome looks like and that this is a president who’s going to continue to hold other countries feet to the fire,” she said. “He’s going to make sure that American workers are put first.”\n\nTrump called the ruling “disappointing” and lashed out at Roberts and five other justices, including Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — whom he appointed to the bench —calling them all “fools and lapdogs.“\n\n“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth. The two of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House Friday.\n\nHe praised Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a dissent. The president said he was “proud” of Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed in 2018.\n\nThe president followed the ruling with the announcement that he signed an executive order to impose a 10 percent tariff on imports from countries around the world “effective immediately.” He invoked Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision that allows for tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days to address “large and serious” trade deficits, to enact the new levies.\n\nThe White House said Canada and Mexico are exempt from the new tariffs due to the trilateral free trade agreement that was ratified during Trump’s first term in 2020.\n\nSome Republican members of Congress also broke with the president, hailing the Supreme Court ruling as a victory for free trade, the separation of powers, or both.\n\n“Today’s ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders’ system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in his own post online, said the court’s ruling “will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism,” referring to potential 2028 presidential contender Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "title": "3 reasons dire economic predictions about Trump's policies haven't played out, according to one think tank",
    "description": "According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have been wrong on Trump's policies.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's economic policies have not led to the dire scenarios of recession or steep inflation that many economists have warned about over the last year. According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have so far gotten it wrong.\n\nTrump has challenged the conventional economic norms in multiple ways that economists have warned would stress the system.\n\nTrump's tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court on Friday, but experts spent the year leading up to the decision predicting dire consequences from the sweeping trade policy. For the most part, though, downbeat assessments of tariffs and other Trump policies haven't come to pass.\n\nTrump has used tariffs aggressively and cracked down on immigration, shrinking the labor force, yut the economy has mostly held strong with unemployment still historically low and consumers still spending. He's also tried to erode the Federal Reserve's independence and has added to the national debt with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Interest rates haven't had a big reaction to either development, both of which could be viewed as inflationary.\n\nBen Harris, vice president and director of Economic Studies at Brookings, put out some explanations for the discrepancies this week.\n\nFirst, Brookings thinks everything has turned out better than some expected because the negative impacts of Trump's policies and actions were overestimated to begin with. The Fed is difficult to influence, tariffs aren't as steep as originally thought, and the pass-through to consumers has been smaller than expected.\n\n\"Perhaps mainstream economic models are simply wrong,\" Harris wrote. \"Is it possible the economics profession overstated the value of immigration, free trade, Fed independence, and a sustainable fiscal outlook?\"\n\n\"It's entirely possible that this volatile episode in American policymaking will lead to a greater understanding of the US economy,\" he continued. \"There could be one enduring lesson—learned both over the course of 2025 as well as during the pandemic—that the size and diversity of the U.S. economy usually protects it from sharp downturns.\"\n\nSecond is the positive fiscal impact of both the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the GOP's landmark tax and spending bill — and of all the corporate spending on AI development. Harris pointed out that AI capex accounted for 40% of GDP in 2025; Goldman Sachs sees consumers' disposable incomes expanding by 0.4% in the first six months of 2026 thanks to the OBBBA; and foreign investors have pledged to spend billions of dollars in the US amid Trump's trade wars.\n\nThird and finally, Harris said we may not have seen the final impact of Trump's policies, and it's still too early to issue a verdict on them.\n\n\"This explanation is consistent with economic theory and evidence. The economic impact of curtailed immigration and mass deportations can take years to materialize,\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"The complexity of the FOMC's composition means that it may take years until we see the full impact of political influence,\" he added. \"And on tariffs, as we have heard from our western trading partners recently in Davos, only now have they begun to explore alternatives to the U.S. in terms of trade and investment decisions.\"",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question on whether the U.S. could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a TV interview that his country was planning to finalize a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.\n\n“I don’t think it takes long, perhaps, in a matter of a week or so, we can start real, serious negotiations on the text and come to a conclusion,” Araghchi said on MSNOW's “Morning Joe” show.\n\nThe tensions between the longtime adversaries have ramped up as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades, with more warships and aircraft on the way.\n\nOn Friday, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea after being sent by Trump from the Caribbean, according to images of the ship by maritime photographers posted to social media.\n\nBoth Iran and the U.S. have signaled that they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out. “We are prepared for diplomacy, and we are prepared for negotiation as much as we are prepared for war,” Araghchi said Friday.\n\nAli Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group, said Iran “would treat any kinetic action as an existential threat.”\n\nVaez said he doesn’t think Iran’s leaders are bluffing when they say they would retaliate, while they likely believe they could maintain their hold on power despite any U.S. airstrikes.\n\nTrump said a day earlier that he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal following recent rounds of indirect negotiations, including this week in Geneva, that made little visible progress. But the talks have been deadlocked for years after Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.\n\nAraghchi also said Friday that his American counterparts have not asked for zero enrichment of uranium as part of the latest round of talks, which is not what U.S. officials have said publicly.\n\n\"What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever,\" he said.\n\nHe added that in return, Iran will implement some confidence-building measures in exchange for relief on economic sanctions.\n\nIn response to Araghchi’s claim, a White House official said Trump has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes last June on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump said at the time that the strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, but the exact damage is unknown as Tehran has barred international inspectors.\n\nAlthough Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.\n\nTrump's comments have faced pushback from some lawmakers who say the president should get Congress' approval before any strike.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Friday that he has filed a war powers resolution that would require that step. Though it has no chance of becoming law — in part because Trump himself would have to sign it — some bipartisan consensus has arisen recently among senators who forced votes on previous resolutions on military action in Venezuela.\n\nNone of those resolutions passed, but they were successful in showing how lawmakers are troubled by some of Trump’s aggressive foreign policy maneuvers.\n\n“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price, Ben Finley, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.\n\n“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.\n\nHundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThat prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.\n\nHalligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.\n\nU.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.\n\nLast week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.",

    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

    "fullText": "Wall Street is weighing the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, with investors on the hunt for stocks that stand to gain the most from the reversal of the landmark trade policy.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that Trump can't use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs. Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

    "description": "A 6-3 majority struck down one of President Donald Trump's favored methods to impose tariffs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court after justices dealt a sweeping rebuke of his trade policy.\n\nIn some of his harshest criticisms ever of the nation's highest court, Trump said some justices should be \"absolutely ashamed\" for siding against him. Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

    "description": "In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court upended President Donald Trump's trade agenda and left many major questions unanswered.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a stinging rebuke of the Supreme Court for striking down most of his tariffs.\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" Trump said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump vowed to press on with his trade agenda, starting with a sweeping 10% global tariff that will be in addition to any existing tariffs. The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",

    "description": "Major indexes rose on Friday, with investors looking past a weak GDP report after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's tariffs are illegal.",
    "fullText": "Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.\n\nUS stocks reversed earlier losses after the Supreme Court struck down the sweeping trade policy the president unveiled last April. The decision is a major update to an issue that's been a source of intense uncertainty and volatility for much of the last year, and will also raise new questions about how Trump might pursue his landmark policy push.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around noon ET on Friday:\n\nThe news on tariffs outweighed a disappointing update on economic growth, while PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, heated up faster than expected. GDP grew 1.4% year-over-year last quarter, falling far short of estimates, while PCE rose 0.4% in December, slightly above the anticipated 0.3% gain.\n\n\"The market just totally erupted,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider. \"In the short run, it's good for corporate earnings.\"\n\nHere are four big takeaways for investors.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Trump's ability to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that allows the president to regulate economic activity in emergency events.\n\nBut there are a handful of other legal avenues the president could use to try to impose tariffs again, according to Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The Trump administration can impose pretty much the equivalent levies if they so wish to, which you'd imagine they do,\" he told Business Insider, adding that his outlook on US trade policy hadn't changed significantly over the long term.\n\n\"The president has already signalled that he will quickly pivot to other legal tools to achieve similar trade restrictions, and he has at his disposal multiple levers to pull in order to circumvent the verdict,\" Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at Ebury, wrote on Friday, adding that Trump's longer-term strategy for tariffs was \"unlikely to be derailed.\"\n\n\"The ball is now in the administration's court—specifically the willingness and ability to impose tariffs under alternative legal authorities,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a top economist and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in a post on X.\n\nShould Trump impose new tariffs, it's likely that import duties will be lower due to the legal precedent set by the SCOTUS ruling, according to Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"In particular, it will be harder for the White House to impose tariffs without clear justification and due process. Businesses and consumers will get more clarity and lower rates going forward,\" Long wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nThe positive market reaction on Friday suggests that investors think tariff refunds are a possibility, according to Pepperstone's Brown.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, said he believed the US would likely issue between $100 billion and $130 billion in tariff refunds.\n\n\"When one thinks about the fiscal tailwind that may inject $100-150 billion in cash to American households this year in addition to tariff refunds we are talking real money,\" he wrote in a post on X, referring to the amount households are expected to get in tax refunds this year.\n\nIt's unclear how the refunds, if the US will issue any, will work, Long said.\n\n\"The refund process will be a mess,\" she wrote. \"It's likely the White House will fight against issuing refunds at all.\n\nBond yields ticked higher shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, a sign that concerns are beginning to swell over the US debt picture again, now that tariff revenue, for the moment, has been taken off the table.\n\n\"Tariffs had been functioning as a shadow tax that helped fund spending without explicitly raising taxes. Remove that and the deficit widens, borrowing rises, and historically that is the type of development that leans on the bond market and pressures yields higher,\" Mark Malek, the CIO of Siebert Financial, wrote in a note on Friday.",

    "title": "Now That Trump's Tariffs Have Been Ruled Illegal, Will Tech Prices Lower?",
    "description": "It's not clear whether prices will come down now that these tariffs are ending.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The Supreme Court struck down the president's signature economic orders on Friday in a 6-3 ruling, spelling the end of a controversial policy that added an estimated $1,000 tax increase for each American household, raised prices on consumer goods, and alienated key U.S. allies.\n\nNot all of Trump's tariffs need to end because of this ruling. The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "description": "President Trump was the first to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.\n\n“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision on Friday left uncertain the extent to which those who paid tariffs might be able to obtain refunds, with Justice Kavanaugh warning that any refund process could be a substantial “mess.”\n\nThe United States “may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid” the tariffs, he wrote, “even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.”\n\nThe court’s ruling, backed by justices from across the ideological spectrum, was a rare and significant example of the Supreme Court pushing back on Mr. Trump’s agenda. Since he returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority had overwhelmingly issued emergency orders allowing the president to carry out his policies on a temporary basis. But the decision on Friday will have a more lasting impact.\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees — Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Chief Justice Roberts and the three liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump called the Supreme Court’s ruling “a disgrace” while speaking to the nation’s governors on Friday, according to two people familiar with his comments.\n\nEarly last year, Mr. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations.\n\nA dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing.\n\nPratik Shah, the lead lawyer for the toy company, said in a statement that the justices had “upheld the foundational separation-of-powers principle that our small-business client has been fighting for: no president has boundless power to tax Americans.”\n\nIn court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has collected roughly $240 billion in tariff revenue since April 2, 2025 labeled “Liberation Day,” by President Trump. The research firm Capital Economics estimated that if the Treasury is forced to issue refunds, the cost would run to about $120 billion or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nBut even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law.\n\nMr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThe affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nDuring oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers.\n\nIn its 21-page opinion, the majority said it was telling that for half a century, no other president had invoked the statute to impose “any tariffs — let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.”\n\nThe two words “regulate” and “importation,” the court said, do not give the president the power to “impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.”\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the president’s use of the statute had run afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch. The court relied on the same doctrine to strike down President Joseph R. Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe three liberal justices agreed with the overall ruling, but insisted the same result could have been reached without applying the doctrine, which they have been critical of in the past.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a lengthy and forceful separate opinion agreeing that Mr. Trump had overstepped his authority and defending Congress as the proper branch to impose taxes.\n\n“Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” he wrote. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Kavanaugh said the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs and noted that they had helped the administration negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars.\n\nEven so, Justice Kavanaugh laid out other ways the president could set duties through different federal statutes.\n\n“So the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward,” he wrote. “But the court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.\n\nAbbie VanSickle Tyler Pager and @Patti Cohen contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "MAGA’s hate machine is—at least temporarily—sputtering.\n\nOn Monday, late-night host Stephen Colbert attempted to interview Texas Senate hopeful James Talarico. Instead of this being a routine nothing-to-write-home-about few minutes chat with a little-known Texas state representative, Colbert ran into a legal wall: CBS’s attorneys told the broadcaster to pull the interview after Trump’s FCC argued that late-night-show interviews of political candidates from one party but not the other violate federal regulations. The network allegedly advised the host that he shouldn’t even discuss on-air that it had put the kibosh on the interview.\n\nColbert wasn’t amused. Not only did he proceed to talk about it on the air; he interviewed Talarico and posted it on YouTube, where, within two days, the clip had garnered some 7.8 million views.\n\nA week ago, polls showed Representative Jasmine Crockett leading Talarico by eight points. If Talarico ends up winning his primary in Texas and then goes on to win the general election against the front-runner to be the GOP’s nominee, Texas’s far-right attorney general, Ken Paxton—who avoided a likely conviction for securities fraud two years ago by taking a plea bargain and agreeing to do community service—he will have Trump’s anti–First Amendment FCC to thank for his meteoric rise to national prominence.\n\nPolling conducted before the Colbert interview of a hypothetical Talarico-Paxton matchup shows the race to be a toss-up. And now CBS’s pandering to the Trump administration over the Colbert interview has given the Democrat a crucial publicity boost just as early voting in the March 3 primaries gets underway. Indeed, many of the more than 65,000 commenters on the YouTube video specifically thanked the FCC for bringing the interview, and the candidate, to their attention.\n\n“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights,” Talarico explained to Colbert, in reacting to the attempts to censor him. The audience roared its approval. For the next 14 minutes, Talarico hit rhetorical home run after home run, denouncing the hypocrisies of Christian Nationalism—“people baptizing their partisanship and calling that Christianity”—attacking the xenophobia of the MAGA movement, and explaining how the real fight in America is “not left versus right; it’s top versus bottom.” That’s as succinct a summary of the problem of oligarchy as any I have heard.\n\nOver the last few weeks, there has been something remarkably ham-handed and asinine about the authoritarianism that Trump 2.0 is serving up. The ambition remains. The administration is still trying to curtail free speech, chill political participation, and take over election processes in the run-up to the November vote, but some of the enthusiasm and efficiency of the administration that we saw last year seems to have at least temporarily dissipated.\n\nSince the Department of Homeland Security announced that the ICE surge in Minneapolis was ending, Stephen Miller, the most outspoken proponent of Trump’s might-is-right worldview, has been remarkably silent. Greg Bovino, the Gestapo-trenchcoat-wearing public face of ICE, has largely vanished from view. (Bovino was last seen with some drinking buddies being unceremoniously kicked out of a bar on the Las Vegas strip.)\n\nKristi Noem also went largely silent, though in her case she couldn’t quite go a whole week without doing something blitheringly stupid, entirely offensive, cruel, or patently unconstitutional. At a press conference, she announced that the blizzard of federal investigations into alleged voter fraud were intended to “make sure we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.” Someone apparently forgot to give her the memo that you don’t say the really undemocratic stuff out loud. And later in the week, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a memo announcing that refugees in the United States who hadn’t gotten their green card within one year of arrival would be subject to arrest and detention. As for Trump’s lapdog attorney general, Pam Bondi, after the debacle of her congressional hearing, she has apparently decided to hide under the tranche of Epstein documents that, drip by drip, leak by leak, are corroding what remains of the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n\nEven Trump’s social media presence has become tired and formulaic. When Winter Olympics athlete Hunter Hess said that representing Trump’s United States “brings up mixed emotions,” the narcissist in chief took time out from his busy day to post on Truth Social, “U.S. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn’t represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe post was so boring that Hess didn’t even mention Trump in his reply. “There is so much that is great about America, but there are always things that could be better,” the athlete wrote. “One of the many things that makes this country so amazing is that we have the right and the freedom to point that out.” Apparently, in between his training sessions on the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, Hess attended the high school civics lesson on the First Amendment that the Trump team all skipped out on.\n\nOf course, by next week the sundowning authoritarian may have pushed the United States into an avoidable forever war with the Iranians, and with the help of GOP governors in key states such as Texas and Florida, he may have escalated his efforts to sabotage the midterm elections. In fact, if I were a betting man, I’d say the odds were pretty high on both of those fronts. But given the horrors we are living through, I’ll take small graces where I can. For now, at least some of the air seems to have gone out of Trump—and when push comes to shove, a deflated, tired Trump, despite all the military hardware at his fingertips, is simply a nasty, trash-talking, increasingly addled old man.",

    "description": "In truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground.",
    "fullText": "To stay up to date with all Jurisprudence news, please \n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.\n\nIn truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nRoberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”\n\nCongress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.\n\nAnother clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.\n\nThere was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.\n\nShould we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.\n\nBut we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.\n\n\"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama \"gave classified information\" and wasn't \"supposed to be doing that,\" adding that he could get him \"out of trouble\" by declassifying the relevant files.\n\nObama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are \"real\" and that they're not \"being kept\" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens \"have made contact with us.\"\n\nAliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.\n\nOn the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nOne of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.\n\nBetting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.\n\nPolymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.\n\nIf the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.\n\nIn November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.\n\nThe mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.\n\nAt that time, Trump said the government \"knows what is happening\" but wasn't sharing it.\n\n\"For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Something strange is going on,\" he added.\n\nA Facebook group titled \"New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it\" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.",

Since the 2026 Winter Olympics kicked off in Milan earlier this month, MAGA has been melting down at U.S. Olympians who have spoken about their complicated feelings representing the country on the world stage, following Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deadly operations.

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.\n\nThe PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.\n\nThe investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.\n\nThe department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.\n\n“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.\n\nMany of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”\n\nThe PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.\n\n“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”\n\nThe group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.\n\nMIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.\n\nThe University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.\n\n“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.\n\nThe University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.\n\nOut of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.\n\nThe Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”\n\nThe administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A large banner featuring Donald Trump's face was hung on the exterior of Justice Department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the Republican president's efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.\n\nWhile Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department's tradition of independence from White House control.\n\nThe banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has postured herself as the president's chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nTrump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the Justice Department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.\n\nThe Justice Department in a statement Thursday said it is proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction.”\n\nThe Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president's perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.\n\nFederal prosecutors brought charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Comey said the banner was “sickening to see,” adding that the administration \"forgot to cover the inscription” on one side of the building that says, “Where law ends tyranny begins.\"\n\nThe department is also investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.",

    "description": "The consequences of this shift are not abstract.",
    "fullText": "During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.\n\nNow, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.\n\nBut now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.\n\nThis issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.\n\nI know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.\n\nThis is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.\n\nThe moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.",

Trump then handed off the documents to those next to him to hold up, and handed out pens as if he were participating in a bill-signing ceremony at the White House.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration has issued a sweeping new order that could lead to the arrest of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the United States but do not yet have permanent residency, overturning years of legal and immigration safeguards.\n\nA memo filed by the Department of Homeland Security ahead of a Thursday federal court hearing in Minnesota says refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. for review of their applications.\n\nDHS “may maintain custody for the duration of the inspection and examination process,” said the memo, which was filed Wednesday.\n\nAdvocacy and resettlement groups slammed the order, which will likely face legal challenges and could sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of immigration restrictions by the Trump administration, which has upended longstanding policies toward refugees, including dramatically reducing the number admitted into the country. A memo obtained by The Associated Press late last year said the administration was planning a review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, and immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who arrived during those years.\n\nThe administration has cited national security and economic concerns for its changed policies. Experts say refugees let into the country already undergo extensive vetting.\n\nThe new order came hours before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim heard arguments Thursday on whether he should extend a temporary order that protects Minnesota refugees lawfully in the U.S. from being arrested and deported. Tunheim’s order applies only in Minnesota, but the implications of the new national policy was a major part of the discussion anyway.\n\nHow many people could be arrested under the new order was unclear.\n\nJustice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during Thursday's hearing that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but indicated that would not always happen.\n\n“That's a discretion call for DHS to make,” he said, a comment met with skepticism by attorneys for the Minnesota refugees.\n\nTunheim did not rule Thursday, saying he’d issue a written decision on whether the temporary order would be extended.\n\nAfter the hearing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said at a news conference outside the courthouse that the government \"failed to offer any coherent argument for their policy in either law or fact.” She wasn’t in court for the hearing, but said she'd been briefed about it.\n\n“And so we will continue the fight for justice in the courts,” Smith said, flanked by attorneys and refugee rights supporters, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nImmigration advocates quickly pushed back against the new policy, with HIAS, an international Jewish nonprofit serving refugees and asylum-seekers, calling it “a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed.”\n\n“They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention,\" Beth Oppenheim, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nTunheim blocked the government from targeting the Minnesota refugees last month, saying the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claims “that their arrest and detention, and the policy that purports to justify them, are unlawful.” His Jan. 28 temporary restraining order will expire Feb. 25 unless he grants a more permanent preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge previously rejected the government’s claim that it had the legal right to arrest and detain refugees who haven’t obtained their green cards within a year of arriving in the U.S.\n\n“Mandating detention would lead to an illogical result,” Tunheim wrote, since refugees can’t even apply for green cards until they’ve been in the U.S. for a year. The government's interpretation, he said, means nearly all refugees would face detention unless immigration officials conducted their review at exactly the one-year mark, which he called “nonsensical.”\n\nRefugee rights groups sued the federal government in January after the government launched Operation PARRIS, an acronym for Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening.\n\nIt was billed as a “sweeping initiative” to reexamine the cases of 5,600 Minnesota refugees who had not yet been granted permanent resident status, or green cards. The agencies cited fraud in public programs in Minnesota as justification.\n\nOperation PARRIS was part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targeting Minnesota, including a surge of thousands of federal officers. Homeland Security called it the largest immigration enforcement operation ever. It sparked mass protests after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens. White House border czar Tom Homan announced last week the surge was ending, though a small federal presence would remain.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE officers went door to door under Operation PARRIS arresting refugees and sending them to detention centers in Texas, without access to attorneys. Some were later released in Texas and left to find their own way back to Minnesota, they said.\n\nTunheim noted in his order that refugees are extensively vetted by multiple agencies before being resettled in the U.S. He wrote that none arrested in the operation had been deemed a danger to the community or a flight risk, nor had any been charged with crimes that could be grounds for deportation.\n\nTunheim stressed that the refugees impacted by his order were admitted into the U.S. because of persecution in their home countries. He prohibited further arrests under Operation PARRIS and ordered that detainees still in custody from it be released and returned to Minnesota.\n\n“They are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border. Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s top aides have warned his administration to stay on message as the midterm elections approach in a bid to counter the president’s unpredictable behavior and tendency to go wildly off-script.\n\nAt a strategy session for dozens of administration officials on Tuesday night, the president’s inner circle also acknowledged that affordability would remain a major issue for voters, especially if they didn’t feel the gains Trump often talks about.\n\nThe meeting, on Capitol Hill, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, with presentations by her deputy, James Blair, and GOP veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio.\n\nAnd while Trump was not in the room, his longstanding concern—that it is rare for the president’s party to win in midterm elections—was front and center, according to sources.\n\nDuring the two-hour session, Blair, a 36-year-old former political consultant, presented historical trends to this effect.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Trump could be unpredictable and was likely to say and do as he pleased, without necessarily focusing on data. Therefore, he said, it was crucial for everyone else to remain on message, disciplined, and data-driven as the campaign ramped up.\n\nHe also suggested that there was no point in talking about wages going up (something that Trump cites regularly) unless voters feel the impacts of the administration’s economic achievements.\n\nA similar challenge confronted former President Joe Biden, who repeatedly touted the value of so-called “Bidenomics”—even as millions of Americans struggled with cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe session, which took place at Washington’s Capitol Hill Club, was attended by dozens of administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThey were told that they would be required to be more active as surrogates for the midterms, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with a third of the seats in the 100-member Senate.\n\nLosing in November could ultimately dent Trump’s legislative agenda for the next two years and result in articles of impeachment against him and members of his Cabinet.\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot for the midterms, Wiles revealed last year that the White House had shifted its strategy and would make him “campaign like it’s 2024” in the hope that more voters would turn out for the GOP.\n\n“Typically in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting at the White House—you localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” she told conservative group Moms of America.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nBut the president faces a number of headwinds ahead of November, from sinking approval ratings and a fracturing MAGA base, as well as firestorms on everything from the Epstein files to ICE and immigration.\n\nHis bombastic tendency to go wildly off-script is also an issue, such as describing affordability as a “con job” or claiming that the Epstein files are a Democratic “hoax”.\n\nFabrizio took the group through a series of data outlining the issues that matter to voters in targeted seats, with the economy being the top-tier issue, which he said resonated more than border security.\n\nHe also suggested focusing more on podcasts and social media, rather than traditional interviews and news outlets, to get the message out.\n\nBut whether a more disciplined approach will be enough to counter the president’s unpredictability is yet to be seen, according to some Republicans.\n\n“If they stay on message, it’s a good thing,” said Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon. “They get sidetracked… they’ve got to stay focused.”\n\nCritics have also accused Trump of “gaslighting” Americans by trying to spotlight affordability and drug prices on the campaign trail.\n\n“Trump running on affordability is laughable,” said Protect Our Care president Brad Woodhouse.\n\n“Republican policies have only made life more expensive for hard-working families, and nothing has made that more clear than the GOP’s catastrophic cuts to health care.”",

(Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americans make up 37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)\n\nThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.\n\nCoined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.\n\n“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”\n\nDuring memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.\n\nThe Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video app Sora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism to sully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King and Charlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.\n\nInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted a doctored photo of Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying the Obamas as apes was circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.\n\nBlackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn their heyday, minstrel shows were the dominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,” explained Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.\n\nEven as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’s Joy Buolamwini were sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.\n\nTech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled a tempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos, to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.\n\nBlack in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.\n\n“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”\n\nAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by the Trump administration highlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.\n\nBeyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”\n\nEven so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”",

    "description": "Canadians are staying away from their usual snowbird destinations, with many opting for domestic trips, or looking towards Mexico, and the Caribbean.",
    "fullText": "Canadian travellers are still unhappy with President Donald Trump, and that's affecting the 2026 outlook of visitors to the US from Canada.\n\nIn 2025, there was a noticeable travel chill from the US's northern neighbor, following President Donald Trump's quips about the \"51st state\" and the levying of hefty tariffs.\n\nA January survey of more than 1,000 Canadian prospective travelers found that they remain hesitant to travel to the US and would rather support domestic tourism, according to Longwoods International, a tourism industry market research company.\n\nAccording to Longwoods International, 55% of surveyed Canadian travelers report that they intend to travel to the US within the next 12 months, which remains mostly unchanged from 54% reported in October 2025. Among those who intend to make the trip, only 9% say they have already made bookings.\n\nIn 2025, 4 million fewer Canadian travelers visited the US than the previous year, marking a 22% drop, according to the US Commerce Department's National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Canadian respondents to the latest survey, who said they changed their 2026 travel plans to avoid the US, cited economic policies and tariffs.\n\nOther factors are also at work. More than 40% of respondents told Longwoods International that they strongly or somewhat disagree that the US is a place that values international travelers, welcomes travelers with diverse backgrounds, is a safe place to visit, and feels welcoming in general, and the number of Canadians who agree that the US feels safe to visit has been declining over the past year.\n\nPopular destinations for Canadian snowbirds, such as southern California and Florida, have been trying to woo them back. But it appears that those attempts have fallen flat as Trump continues to threaten Canada with tariffs and recently threatened to delay the opening of a bridge Canada paid for.\n\nIn 2025, California's Gov. Gavin Newsom began trying to convince Canadians with targeted video campaigns that California welcomes them. Recently, heart-shaped banners featuring the Canadian flag also popped up in Palm Springs, which, according to the Los Angeles Times, is feeling a chill this winter from fewer Canadian tourists.\n\n\"Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in DC, but don't let that ruin your beach plans,\" Newsom said in a campaign video. \"California is the ultimate playground — over 2,000 miles from Washington and a world away in mindset.\"\n\nAccording to Visit California, the number of Canadian visitors to the state still fell by over 18% in 2025 compared to the year prior, slipping to 1.4 million. In 2024, Visit California showed that 1.7 million Canadians visited the state and spent around $3.7 billion.\n\nEven Disney, the happiest place on earth, is feeling the impact as international travelers skip the US. In the Walt Disney Company's first-quarter earnings report earlier in February, the company said it is facing \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks, including Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.\n\nVisit Florida lists Canada as the state's top source of international visitors, with around 3.4 million travelers from Canada to the state in 2024. In 2025, the state saw a 15% year-over-year drop, according to Visit Florida, with only 2.9 million visitors from Canada.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet are also suspending all or some flights from Canada to the US this summer.\n\n\"We saw a notable decline in transborder travel demand throughout 2025,\" Julia Kaiser, media relations advisor for WestJet, told Global News earlier in February. \"As a result, we made timely decisions to modify our network to stay aligned with where Canadians want to go.\"\n\nThe slowdown in trips to the US doesn't mean that Canadians are no longer traveling. Longwoods International said that 45% of Canadian travelers who changed their plans for a US trip now say they would substitute it with a domestic trip, while about a quarter of prospective travelers are looking toward Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nAs of February 17, China also opened up visa-free entry for all Canadian citizens, allowing up to 30 days of travel for business, tourism, family visits, or transit.",

    "fullText": "CNN’s studio mic caught an anchor’s unvarnished reaction to an aside from President Donald Trump that involved his lack of affection for “handsome men.”\n\nTrump gave a speech Thursday morning at an event promoting his Board of Peace at the contentiously renamed “Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.”\n\nAccording to pool reports, there were pro-Palestinian protesters across the street from the building “with big signs yelling ‘Donald Trump go to hell.’”\n\nThe president’s speech featured the usual stylistic flourishes and characteristic deviations — including one aside that caught CNN anchor Sara Sidner off guard.\n\nSidner and co-anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan covered the speech live on Thursday’s edition of CNN News Central, during which the network cut in midway through Trump’s remarks.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He’s a great guy. They’re all great. But I was very proud of it.\n\nPresident Penna (Peña) of Paraguay is here. President. President, thank you very much.\n\nYoung, handsome guy. It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you.\n\nI don’t like young, handsome men.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Women, I like. Men, I don’t have any interest.\n\nCNN ANCHOR JOHN BERMAN: Right. President Trump is speaking to his Board of Peace. This is the organization he founded first to help rebuild Gaza.\n\nTrump riffed freely as he introduced the other leaders at the event, as well.\n\nElsewhere in the speech, Trump appeared to try and assuage concerns about his entity being at odds with the United Nations, claiming his goal was to “strengthen up” the UN:\n\nThe Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly. But we’re going to strengthen up the United Nations. We’re going to make sure it’s facilities are good if they need help, and they need help, money wise, we can help them money wise. And we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable.\n\nWatch above via CNN News Central.\n\nThe post Hot Mic Catches CNN Anchor’s Stunned Reaction to Trump Blurting He Doesn’t ‘Like Handsome Men’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "After the major student-loan companies declined to release their own performance data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren requested information from the Ed. Dept.",
    "fullText": "Curious how your student-loan servicer is performing? You might be out of luck — for now.\n\nWhen asked by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for data on their performances, the major student-loan servicers delivered nearly identical responses — exclusively reviewed by Business Insider — that referred the lawmaker back to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office.\n\nOne servicer, MOHELA, wrote in a January 5 email to Warren that it has \"a formal statement that FSA has requested we send.\"\n\nThe statement, which the other servicers also sent, stated: \"Because your letter requests information and data maintained by the Department's office of Federal Student Aid, we respectfully ask that the request be redirected to the Department via the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\"\n\nMonitoring student-loan servicers' performance will become more critical this year as the Department of Education begins implementing its repayment changes that President Donald Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It will also prove more difficult after the Trump administration slashed staff at the consumer watchdog that played a large role in doing so.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers have expressed confusion about the changes, and lawmakers and policy experts have previously stressed the importance of ensuring that servicers are equipped to effectively implement new repayment plans, borrowing caps, and other reforms.\n\nIn response to a prior information request from Warren, Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent wrote in a letter in September 2025 that \"FSA is prioritizing efforts to improve customer service to student and parent borrowers,\" and did not comment on formally releasing performance metrics.\n\nThe last comprehensive report on servicer performance and borrower data posted on FSA's website covered the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Past reports have included customer satisfaction scores, average speed to answer calls, and data on the servicers' portfolios. Warren and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that, following the servicers' responses, they are requesting that the Department of Education publish servicer performance data and make it available to the public.\n\n\"ED has repeatedly refused to comply with Congressional requests for basic servicer performance data and now appears to be refusing to allow federal student loan servicers to provide this information, despite previous Administrations granting such requests,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWarren and Merkley requested that the Department of Education provide data on a range of topics, including call center performance, customer service staff levels, and communication efforts to borrowers in delinquency and default.\n\nOversight over the industry has declined due to the Trump administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that Warren helped create. The CFPB's chief legal officer directed the agency's employees in an April 2025 memo to \"deprioritize\" student-loan oversight, saying that the goal was to shift oversight responsibility to the states.\n\nAdditionally, Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues released a new report in early February detailing how private lenders are preparing for an influx of federal borrowers due to the new borrowing caps set to go into effect this summer. They wrote that their findings \"underscore an urgent need for oversight of the private lending market as these companies prepare to cash in on the Administration's agenda.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is trying to chip away at the integrity of the voting process ahead of the November midterms because he knows Republicans will not fare well, Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf says.\n\nRothkopf told The Daily Beast Podcast that the Trump administration’s actions and the president’s words should be taken “very seriously.”\n\n“The reality is that they realize they’re going to lose, and so they are using every conceivable tool in order to put their thumb on the scale, right?” Rothkopf told host Joanna Coles.\n\nRothkopf gave two examples: the FBI’s controversial raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election office for 2020 voter rolls and other materials, and Attorney General Pam Bondi offering to scale back Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis only if Governor Tim Walz provided voters’ unredacted personal data.\n\n“Why do they want the voter rolls? So they can disqualify people. Why do they want to pursue the conspiracy theories about Fulton County? So they can say, ‘Well, we need to impound these machines. There’s a potential problem’,” he said. “You will never see the votes again. You will never see what comes out of that.”\n\nRothkopf also cited the GOP-favoring redistricting effort that Texas began, and which other red-leaning states like Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina followed. He also mentioned the SAVE America Act. That legislation, which has passed the House, would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote and government-issued photo ID to vote in federal elections. It would also limit mail-in voting and end ballot harvesting. Critics have argued that eligible voters without passports or birth certificates would be disenfranchised.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s Department of Justice has been seeking unredacted copies of voter registration databases, with critics arguing this is a federal intrusion into state matters.\n\nComments by Trump are also cause for alarm. The president has not only called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” but has also floated canceling the midterms.\n\nMAGA stalwart Steve Bannon has said Trump is bent on proving that the 2020 election was stolen from him in order to then prevent Democratic wins in 2026 and 2028.\n\nIf any of Trump’s actions targeting the 2026 midterms end up being prosecutable, and if Republicans can “put their thumb on the scale” again in 2028, Rothkopf said, Trump will support a successor who will “cover his a--.” In that case, the ticket would be Bondi and Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nBondi “has completely debased herself—taken the entire Department of Justice, turned it into a Department of Obstruction of Justice and Retribution,” Rothkopf said. “And in [Trump’s] book, that’s a winner.”\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson repeated the administration’s line that “anything said on the Daily Beast podcast is equivalent to screaming into the void. No one listens to this Trump Derangement Syndrome therapy session.”\n\nTrump “is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” Jackson added. “The President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was visibly stunned after CBS’s Ed O’Keefe asked for examples of President Donald Trump being “falsely called racist” in recent years.\n\n“You’re kidding, right?” replied Leavitt during a White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nShe was responding to O’Keefe’s question, which quoted Trump’s tribute to Jesse Jackson a day earlier.\n\nIn his statement about Jesse Jackson, the president said “Despite the fact that I am falsely inconsistently called a racist by the scoundrels and lunatics on the radical left, Democrats all, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” Where or when does the president believe he has been falsely called racist?\n\nThat spurred Leavitt’s shocked response and led to a few audible chuckles in the briefing room.\n\n“I will pull you plethora of examples. I’m going to get my team in that room to start going through the internet of radical Democrats throughout the years who have accused this president falsely of being a racist,” Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued, “And I’m sure there’s many people in this room and on network television across the country who have accused him of the same. In fact, I know that because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”\n\nLeavitt added that Trump was looking forward to a Black History Month event scheduled for later in the day.\n\n“There is a lot this president has done for all Americans, regardless of race,” she said. “And he has absolutely been falsely called and smeared as a racist, and I’m happy to provide you those receipts.”\n\nTrump’s racial attitudes have long been called out by high-profile media personalities. Ex-CNN star Don Lemon branded Trump a “racist” in 2018, and called him a “racist piece of sh*t” last year. Another CNN alum, Jim Acosta, said in 2018 “this president deep down may just be a racist.” MS NOW anchor Lawrence O’Donnell dubbed Trump the “most racist” president who never owned slaves in 2024, and his colleague, Chris Hayes, called Trump “to his bones a racist” after he posted a video depicting ex-President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes earlier this month.\n\nOther examples include NBC White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accusing Trump of using a “racist term” when he called COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” CBS reporter Weijia Jiang similarly said Trump used “racist phrases” during the pandemic, and Geraldo Rivera — a former longtime friend of the president’s — referring to Trump’s crackdown on migrants as “racist government policy.”\n\nAnd soon after the press briefing wrapped up, one of the White House’s X accounts posted an example of O’Keefe himself calling out Trump for “racist tweets” in 2019:\n\nThis reporter literally called President Trump's tweets racist in 2019. https://t.co/HlgnNg9DZA pic.twitter.com/Crjf26Qttj\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) February 18, 2026\n\nThe post ‘You’re Kidding, Right?’ Karoline Leavitt Gobsmacked After Reporter Asks for Examples of Trump Being ‘Falsely Called Racist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "title": "Trump's top economic advisor says Fed researchers should be punished for their recent views on tariffs",
    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",
