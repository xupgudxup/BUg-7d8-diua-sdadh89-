    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F. Elliott contributed reporting.",

    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

    "fullText": "Jack Smith, the former DOJ special counsel, claimed in closed-door congressional testimony on Wednesday that investigators had proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” that President Donald Trump “criminally” conspired to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSmith made the remarks in his opening statement to lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\n“I made my decisions in the investigation without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith said in his opening statement, which was obtained in advance by the Associated Press. “We took actions based on what the facts and the law required — the very lesson I learned early in my career as a prosecutor.\n\nSmith added that his probe had “developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.”\n\nSmith’s investigation, which began in 2022, focused on Trump’s alleged effort to overturn his 2020 election loss, as well as the classified documents that were stored at Mar-a-Lago. Charges were filed in both investigations, but Trump escaped prosecution due to the longstanding DOJ policy against the indictment of a sitting president.\n\nThe remarks will likely rile up Trump, who has relentlessly maintained for years that he is innocent of any election tampering.\n\nIn October, the president turned his ire toward Smith in a Truth Social post, calling him a “CRIMINAL,” “MAJOR LOWLIFE,” and “FAILURE” who “SHOULD BE IN JAIL.”\n\nThis is a developing story and has been updated.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Jack Smith Claims He Had ‘Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt’ That Trump Conspired to Overturn 2020 Election first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.\n\nThe move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPeople who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.\n\nAt the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.\n\nAn additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.\n\nThe Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.\n\nIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.\n\nThe Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.\n\nThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.\n\n“This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAdvocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That’s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.\n\nNo One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was “deeply concerned” about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.\n\n“Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nCountries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the “utmost seriousness and urgency” and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the “matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.\n\nThe Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.\n\nThe new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several “U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.” The administration also said the recent war in those areas had “likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n\nAnika Kentish in Saint John’s, Antigua, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles calling him a conspiracy theorist in a recent Vanity Fair story.",
    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles calling him a “conspiracy theorist” in an explosive new Vanity Fair story.\n\nThe political world was rocked by Wiles’s explosive tell-all with the outlet. In it, she referred to Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought as a “right-wing absolute zealot,” claimed that President Donald Trump had “an alcoholic’s personality,” and even denied Trump’s previous claims that former President Bill Clinton visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.\n\nWiles also called Vance’s support for Trump “sort of political,” and added that the vice president had been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”\n\nHours after the story went live, Vance was at an event in Pennsylvania to speak about the economy. When it was opened up to questions, Vance was asked for his thoughts on Wiles’s characterization of him. The vice president said:\n\nI haven’t looked at the article. I, of course, have heard about it. But, conspiracy theorist — sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true. And, by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time.\n\nFor example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask 3-year-olds at the height of the Covid pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. You know, I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job. And I believed in the conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was trying to throw his political opponents in jail rather than win an argument against his political opponents.\n\nSo, at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it, and that’s my understanding.\n\nQ: Susie Wiles referred to you as a \"conspiracy theorist\" and your transformation into a Trump supporter as \"an act of political expediency.\" Your response?\n\nJD VANCE: Sometimes I am in conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true pic.twitter.com/ySghDjMgDz\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nAlthough Vance downplayed the article, he later suggested the White House will make themselves less accessible to mainstream media outlets because of it.\n\n“And the last thing I’ll say is if any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance continued, “I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews mainstream media outlets.”\n\nJD Vance: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope it's that we should be giving fewer interview to mainstream media outlets\" pic.twitter.com/6d8LoEIXWD\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nHe also reaffirmed his support for Wiles, stating that he had never seen her be disloyal to the president.\n\nVANCE: I've seen so many people who will say one thing to the president's face and then will do the exact opposite behind the scenes–\n\nGUY IN CROWD: They're traitors!\n\nVANCE: They are. And you know why I really love Susie Wiles? … I've never seen her be disloyal to the… pic.twitter.com/dxq8cS54XH\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nThe post JD Vance Fires Back — Says He Hopes Trump Admin Has Learned ‘Lesson’ After Susie Wiles Called Him a ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ in Vanity Fair first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The president said he is weighing an executive order on the issue.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reiterated that he is “very strongly” weighing an executive order that would reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he is looking into the move, adding that “a lot of people want to see” it happen.\n\n“It leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “So, we are looking at that very strongly.”\n\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The classification puts the drug on the same level as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the White House is weighing whether to list marijuana instead as Schedule III, which is defined as “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” Examples include Tylenol mixed with codeine, ketamine and testosterone.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll from October 2024, 69% of registered voters back reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category, including 51% of Trump supporters and 86% of supporters of former Vice President Kamala Harris. A Morning Consult poll from August found that roughly three in five voters, or 61%, support reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug under federal law.\n\nTrump’s statement follows his broad declaration of support for changing federal policy on the drug while on the 2024 campaign trail. Two months before the election, he said he intended to vote in favor of an amendment that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration also proposed moving the drug to the Schedule III category, though it did not come to fruition by the end of his term. Last year, the Justice Department recommended shifting cannabis to Schedule III, which prompted a formal review by the DEA.\n\nTrump’s announcement drew reactions from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n“Praying that somehow President Trump does not go forward with [this],” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) told NewsNation on Monday that “I think rescheduling marijuana is wrong.”\n\n“The fact is, marijuana is a gateway drug,” Lawler said. “Most of the people who end up using hard substances start out on marijuana.”\n\nWhile Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) previously urged Trump to loosen restrictions on marijuana, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the president “will try to gaslight everyone into believing he just made pot legal.”\n\n“He has not decriminalized cannabis or expunged the records of black and Latino Americans stuck in prison for minor drug offenses,” Wyden wrote on X. “This is just an attempt to boost his pathetic approval ratings.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump met privately last week with marijuana industry executives, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to discuss a plan on relaxing some federal restrictions on the drug. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) joined via a phone call, the outlet first reported.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced the engagement of his son, Donald Trump Jr., to model and socialite Bettina Anderson at a White House holiday party on Monday.\n\nTrump Jr. and Bettina Anderson made their public debut as a couple at Trump's inauguration following months of speculation about the nature of their relationship.\n\nSince going public in January 2025, Trump Jr. and Anderson have appeared together at numerous White House events and Palm Beach galas.\n\nTrump Jr., who is Trump's oldest son, was previously engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and campaign advisor whom Trump chose to serve as his administration's ambassador to Greece.\n\nAnderson, a Palm Beach socialite, model, and the founder and executive director of the wildlife conservation nonprofit Project Paradise, was first spotted in the Trump family's orbit at the Republican National Convention in July 2024.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, Trump Jr., Guilfoyle, and Anderson did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere's a timeline of their relationship.\n\nAnderson was photographed sitting behind Trump Jr., Guilfoyle, and other members of the Trump family on the third and fourth days of the Republican National Convention.\n\nGuilfoyle was still wearing her engagement ring.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. were photographed dining together at the Honor Bar, a restaurant located about 4 miles from Mar-a-Lago, The Daily Mail reported.\n\nNeither responded to a request for comment in September about the nature of their relationship.\n\nTickets to the fundraising dinner cost $100,000 a couple and admission to a fireside chat cost $30,000 a couple, the Palm Beach Daily News reported. Serving on the host committee of the event required a $250,000 contribution.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. were photographed holding hands as they left Buccan, a restaurant in Palm Beach, on Anderson's 38th birthday, The Daily Mail reported.\n\nAnderson also shared a photo on her Instagram story of a bouquet of flowers and a card reading, \"Many have said you're aging out but I think you're perfect...happy birthday!\" She tagged Trump Jr. in the post, appearing to indicate that he was the sender.\n\nLater that month, Anderson joined Trump Jr. at the Trump family's New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. did not officially confirm that he and Guilfoyle had broken off their engagement, he said in a statement to Page Six that they \"will always keep a special bond\" and that he \"could not be more proud of her and the important role she'll continue to play in my father's administration\" as ambassador to Greece.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. attended an inaugural reception at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, DC, on January 18. On January 19, they held hands and danced to \"YMCA\" by The Village People at the Turning Point USA Inaugural-Eve Ball.\n\nAnderson and Trump Jr. traveled to the Capitol Rotunda together on Inauguration Day but sat separately for the ceremony. Trump Jr. sat with his family members on the inaugural platform, while Anderson took her seat in the crowd.\n\nGuilfoyle was also seated in the audience for the inauguration, but not with the Trump family as she had been at the RNC.\n\nPresident Trump was the first sitting president to ever attend the Super Bowl. He was joined by Trump Jr., Anderson, and other family members and associates to watch the Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Kansas City Chiefs at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson were photographed cuddling in their seats in the House chamber before Trump's speech began.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson attended the mfAR Palm Beach Gala in support of the organization's AIDS research and global HIV prevention.\n\nOther celebrities in attendance included Martha Stewart, who received mfAR's Award of Inspiration, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ricky Martin.\n\nThe gala was held days after People magazine reported that Trump Jr.'s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, is dating Tiger Woods.\n\nThat same month, they also attended a golf event at Trump National Doral, Trump's golf resort in Doral, Florida.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson were seated in front of Tiffany Trump and Michael Boulos for the military parade in Washington, DC, which featured 6,600 troops, 150 vehicles, and over 50 aircraft.\n\nTrump Jr. and Anderson joined Eric and Lara Trump at Trump Turnberry, one of Trump's golf clubs in Scotland, for the announcement of a new trade deal between the US and the European Union.\n\nThey were then joined by two of Trump Jr.'s children, Spencer and Chloe, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new golf course at Trump International Golf Links.\n\nAround the same time that Page Six broke the news of Trump Jr. and Anderson's engagement on Monday evening, Trump announced that the two were engaged and called them up to the White House podium to say a few words.\n\nIn a video from the event shared by far-right activist Laura Loomer, Trump Jr. thanked Anderson \"for that one word, yes.\"\n\nAnderson could be seen in the video wearing a diamond ring.\n\n\"This has really been the most unforgettable weekend of my life, and I get to marry the love of my life, and I feel just like the luckiest girl in the world,\" Anderson said at the holiday party, according to the video.",

    "description": "\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" Susie Wiles said of Elon Musk Musk. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"",
    "fullText": "One of President Donald Trump's top aides has some thoughts on Elon Musk.\n\nIn a series of interviews with Vanity Fair published on Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles weighed in on Musk's time as the de facto leader of DOGE, her thoughts on the Musk-led shuttering of USAID, and Musk's personality quirks.\n\n\"The challenge with Elon is keeping up with him,\" Wiles told the outlet, calling Musk an \"avowed ketamine\" user who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag\" in an office building adjacent to the White House during the daytime. \"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\"\n\nAsked about a meme Musk had reposted and later unshared about public sector workers murdering people under the dictatorships of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong, Wiles said: \"I think that's when he's microdosing.\"\n\nIn June, Musk denied being a current ketamine user, writing on X that he was \"NOT taking drugs.\" He said he'd had a prescription for the drug \"a few years ago\" but hadn't taken it since then.\n\nReached for further comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Musk's xAI told Business Insider: \"Legacy Media Lies.\"\n\nIn a separate interview on Monday with the New York Times, Wiles denied commenting on Musk's drug use, saying she \"wouldn't have said it and I wouldn't know.\" But the Times reported that the journalist Chris Whipple, who interviewed Wiles for Vanity Fair, played a tape for the Times in which she could be heard making the comments.\n\nOne of the most notable features of Musk's White House tenure was the sudden dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.\n\n\"I was initially aghast,\" Wiles told Vanity Fair. \"Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work.\"\n\nWiles said the dismantling of USAID was \"not the way\" she would do it, and that she told Musk that he \"can't just lock people out of their offices.\"\n\n\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"\n\nMusk left the White House in the spring and had a falling-out with Trump over the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" though the two men appear to have mended their relationship in recent months.\n\nWiles wrote on X on Tuesday morning that the Vanity Story was a \"disingenuously framed hit piece,\" and that \"significant context was disregarded\" in order to \"paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"\n\nAsked about Wiles's comments, the White House sent Business Insider a supportive statement from Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history,\" Leavitt said. \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\"",

    "description": "Of course, President Donald Trump doubled down on his tasteless social media post about murdered Hollywood director Rob Reiner.",
    "fullText": "Of course, President Donald Trump doubled down on his tasteless social media post about murdered Hollywood director Rob Reiner.\n\nTrump never second-guesses himself, no matter how heinous his actions or words.\n\nHe’s played this game for years, wielding insults and the consequent outrage as a tool of power that solidifies his outsider status and seeds new feuds — which his supporters adore — against political and media elites.\n\nSo the question arising from his diatribes about the “When Harry Met Sally” director is not whether they are grossly offensive. They are. Nor is the fallout likely to destroy Trump politically. Outlandish behavior has never brought him down. And his compulsion to make the tragedy all about himself by declaring Reiner died because of anger he stirred over “Trump Derangement Syndrome” will surprise no one.\n\nBut Trump’s latest assault on decency came at an unprecedented moment in his political story. He’s suffered unheard of revolts from Republicans: in Indiana over his midterm redistricting drive; in the House of Representatives over the Epstein files. He’s out of touch with voters over high prices for groceries, health care and housing. Trump’s approval ratings have also crashed. And some Republicans are envisioning a future freed from all the baggage their president brings.\n\nMaybe his disdain for Reiner, a vocal Trump critic and Democratic fundraiser, was another one of his frequent attempts at deflection. Perhaps it was just an outlet for his ever-boiling lust for vengeance, even against deceased adversaries. (He accused Reiner of being one of the instigators of the Russia controversy during his first term.)\n\nTrump’s first outburst on Truth Social was so offensive, it was necessary to check it was real, and not the work of some AI imposter. But his refusal to repudiate his sentiments later in the Oval Office was a window into his current mood, his diminished political state and his deteriorating public conduct after recently calling a female reporter “piggy.”\n\nHistory suggests that Trump will ride out the controversy over Reiner, who was found dead along with his wife Michele Singer Reiner at their Brentwood, California, home on Sunday. Many MAGA supporters in the social media swamp Monday seemed to regard his comments as truth-telling and a mark of authenticity.\n\nBut this uproar could underscore Trump’s lost connection with most of the country. It reinforces a sense that he remains obsessed with his own grievances rather than focused on working for all Americans.\n\nAnyone in a position of authority in business or the media who’d publicly lambasted Reiner hours after his death would probably have been fired. Trump has no such worries. But ahead of midterm elections next year, Americans may begin to balk at a head of state who injects such poison into the public square ruling unchecked by his pliant party in Congress for a further two years after 2026.\n\nThese are grim times. Reiner’s horrific murder came on the same weekend as a campus shooting at Brown University and an antisemitic massacre in Australia. People are scared and demoralized. In such circumstances, presidents are counted upon to offer consolation, not political bile. Voters may look for an antidote in 2028.\n\nTrump’s outbursts also undercut weeks of complaints by his supporters and conservative media about people who celebrated or politicized the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, as CNN’s Aaron Blake reported.\n\nBut there’s also a more sinister possibility teased out by his comments about Reiner. Across Washington, Trump is being regarded as a lame duck whose power is ebbing, like almost every other term-limited second-term president. But his behavior may be an omen that his eclipse will, as it was in 2020, be marked by abuses of power and acrimony rather than acceptance.\n\nTrump’s power base in Washington has eroded, but not crumbled, as shown by a closing of ranks in the GOP last week over controversial strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats off Venezuela.\n\nStill, there are members of the GOP now willing to condemn Trump.\n\n“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” conservative Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, a now-frequent Trump critic, wrote on X. “I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.”\n\nAnother MAGA dissident, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, wrote on X that the tragedy of the Reiners was “not about politics or political enemies” and that the proper response should be empathy. The Los Angeles Police Department said that the couple’s son Nick, who struggled with addiction and mental health issues, is “responsible” for their deaths.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz posted a generous tribute to Reiner on X. He told reporters later he was “grieving” for the Hollywood director’s family but that the president could “speak for himself.”\n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy is known for his turns of phrase. But he advised the president to speak less. “A wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he’s a wise man. President Trump should have said nothing,” Kennedy told CNN’s Manu Raju.\n\nSeveral House members also criticized Trump. New York Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis said, “I don’t think it was a proper thing to say at this time. It was a tragedy, and I don’t think he should bring politics into it. It was unfortunate.”\n\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson, who owed his swift rise from the backbenches to Trump, displayed a classic case of GOP fence-sitting. “I don’t do ongoing commentary about everything that’s said by everybody in government every day,” he said.\n\nA decade ago, Trump caused similar revulsion with his slander of Republican Sen. John McCain, a true American hero who spent years in the infamous “Hanoi Hilton” prison during the Vietnam War. “He’s not a war hero,” Trump said. “I like people who weren’t captured.”\n\nTrump’s success in riding out a controversy that might have ended anyone else’s presidential campaign became a symbol of how he’d changed the GOP and the laws of politics.\n\nThe Reiner episode shows Trump hasn’t changed.

    "description": "Ben...",
    "fullText": "The late actor and director leaves behind a roster of classic films—and a much safer and juster California.\n\nThe horrific news from Los Angeles Sunday night, that filmmaker and actor Rob Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Reiner, 70, were found murdered in their Brentwood home and that their own son, Nick, stood charged with their deaths capped a weekend of violent news. A shooter at Brown University killed two and wounded nine. The violence at a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach in Australia left 15 dead and 40 injured. In an ambush in Syria, two American soldiers and a translator were killed by an ISIS terrorist.\n\nAll of it is awful, but in the case of the Reiner murders, America lost a voice that had been part of our pop culture and political conversation since the late 1960s. On our TV and movie screens, Reiner came to represent a friendly face of the American liberal left. Reiner rose to stardom in the 1970s on the blockbuster sitcom All in the Family. It happened alongside that of actors like Alan Alda on M*A*S*H, Bea Arthur on Maude, Esther Rolle on Good Times, and Bonnie Franklin on One Day at a Time—all during a run of topically minded primetime TV programming that amplified liberal politics at a moment unlike any other in our pop culture.\n\nThe son of writer-director-comedian Carl Reiner, he began his career writing on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, a leftish music and sketch comedy program, and appearing on shows like Gomer Pyle, USMC as a flower child. In All in the Family, he played liberal college student Mike Stivic, in near-constant opposition to his father-in-law, blue-collar Queens conservative Archie Bunker (Carroll O’Conner), who usually addressed him as “Meathead.” Stivic lived in his in-laws’ house while he studied at Columbia University, and their wives, Gloria Stivic (Sally Struthers) and Edith Bunker (Jean Stapleton), were often caught in the middle between their bickering and staunchly ideological husbands, and often unwittingly shut Archie down. That combustible, close-quarters family setting created some of the best confrontational political satire ever put on television. Stivic almost always had the moral and ideological upper hand when it came to his arguments with Archie, but Reiner always played him with just enough hectoring pomposity and smug overconfidence to help us understand why Archie found him so insufferable. Half a century later, Reiner could still be found arguing daily on social media with another loudmouth oaf from Queens, President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump gloated over Reiner’s murder, the way he did about Stephen Colbert’s show getting canceled and Jimmy Kimmel’s getting suspended—as if Reiner’s murder were another media victory for him. Trump said the murders were “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump…” Trump’s glee—which inadvertently seemed to justify the rage of his own MAGA devotees spurred on to lethal political violence—only gave more credence to Reiner’s frequent claim that Trump is “mentally unfit to be president.” Asked to clarify—or perhaps temper—his callous and narcissistic outburst at an Oval Office press conference, Trump instead doubled down on it.\n\nDespite his liberal politics, Reiner remains so beloved that even Republicans challenged Trump’s pathetic attack. “This is wrong,” New York Republican Representative Mike Lawler replied to Trump on X.com. “Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.” Prominent Trump critics on the right like Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie and Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have no MAGA cred to lose anymore, also chastised the president.\n\nWhen Reiner turned his focus to directing, he released a stellar run of films, beginning in 1984 with This is Spinal Tap. His films covered a wide array of genres and subjects, but several stand as classics: Stand By Me (1986) The Princess Bride (1987), When Harry Met Sally… (1989), and A Few Good Men (1992). From there, he helmed a string of political dramas like Ghosts of Mississippi (1996) and LBJ (2016). In 2015, Reiner and his son Nick also made a semi-autobiographical movie, Being Charlie, about a father and son’s turbulent relationship and the son’s addiction issues.\n\nReiner had no signature visual style. He was not an “auteur” in the heavy-handed sense—a director advertising that what you are watching is being directed at all times. He belongs more in a category of filmmakers focused on the emotional themes shaping their films—conveyed in plot and characters—more than the style of the storytelling itself. His best work belongs alongside films directed by Robert Redford, Mike Nichols, and studio-era directors like George Stevens, William Wyler, and Fred Zinneman. Reiner had a perfect sense of the dramatic core of a scene and a perfect eye for casting. It’s why, even though he did not write most of the films he made, you will never forget lines like “These go to 11” or “I’ll have what she’s having” and “You can’t handle the truth!” or Wallace Shawn’s “Inconceivable!”\n\nPerhaps most important for residents of California, Reiner never lost sight of his true sense of activism. He played the comical flower child and liberal know-it-all on sitcoms or the boorish Marxist Sheldon Flenner in Woody Allen’s 1994 film Bullets Over Broadway, but became incredibly effective, along with wife Michele, as a fundraiser and organizer in state politics. In 1998, he co-organized a campaign to pass California Proposition 10, the California Children and Families Initiative. It put a 50¢ tax on cigarettes and tobacco products to fund First 5 California, a series of health programs for children in the preschool age range. He spent eight years as its chair, and his success lead to a lot of talk about his running for public office.\n\nReiner chose not to do it, and arguably remained more effective in his role as an activist with an outsize pop-culture platform. He and Michele later cofounded the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which successfully challenged California’s Proposition 8—a voter initiative that banned same-sex marriage. She was the group’s treasurer. Vital to its success was recruiting conservatives like George W. Bush’s solicitor general to the Supreme Court, Theordore B. Olsen, and former RNC chair Ken Mehlman. As strident as Reiner could be on social media, he understood the importance of bipartisan activism. They got Proposition 8 overturned in 2013.\n\nReiner used his influence and fortune in the entertainment industry to sound strategic effect as a political organizer. He was born into privilege, and all charges of nepo-babyism certainly apply—both All in the Family and This Is Spinal Tap were backed by his father’s friend Norman Lear. Reiner took all that he had been given as both a personal and civic challenge—a platform with which he paid back all those breaks. Just as important, he knew what to do with the influence it bestowed. That is both his legacy as an artist and as a key figure in making the state of California a far better place to live for millions of its citizens. These achievements speak far more powerfully to us—and even, it seems, to a growing cohort of GOP legislators—than the petty, vindictive, self-serving politics of Donald Trump.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "description": "Sasha...",
    "fullText": "Every day, Trump is saying and doing things that would get most elementary school children suspended.\n\nFirst off, let me say that today, I mourn. I mourn for the death of Rob and Michele Reiner, for the unfathomable tragedy of a mentally troubled young man killing both of his parents in cold blood. I mourn because in ways both big and small, Rob Reiner made the world a better place. I mourn because there are few people on earth whose work made me belly laugh even when I was feeling down—and because now every time I watch an episode of All in the Family, or catch another screening of The Princess Bride, or When Harry Met Sally…, or Spinal Tap, I will know the infinite cruelty of the ending.\n\nI mourn, too, for the beyond-gross way in which Donald Trump, the public face of America, responded to this awful event—and for what it says about where this country is right now.\n\nIf you are the president of the United States, it’s really not very hard to say the right thing in response to such a tragedy. Even if you didn’t personally like the victims, you can say something generic about how you send condolences to the family, how your thoughts and prayers are with the victims, how you hope that in this moment we can put politics aside and grieve as a nation for the loss of a cultural icon.\n\nAnd yet, in his malignant senescence, Trump flubbed it. Astoundingly, he took to Truth Social to post that Reiner’s murder was “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS. He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights.… May Rob and Michele rest in peace!”\n\nWhen, hours later, journalists gave Trump a chance to walk back this ghastly statement, he doubled down. “Well, I wasn’t a fan of his at all. He was a deranged person. I thought he was very bad for our country,” he sneered.\n\nI have written literally hundreds of columns over the years on Trump, and in many of those I have explored how his language, his tone, is overtly fascist. In his dehumanization of his political opponents, even after their murders, we are, indeed, seeing the quintessential fascist bloodlust in play. But, really, this is more akin to the mad Roman emperor Caligula; this is the language of a man fed equal parts lead and mother’s milk as an infant and then told by every be-toga’ed body of sycophantic elites that he is a deity whose every mad impulse is actually part of a divine plan.\n\nSeriously, though, we are now witnessing a full-flowering malignancy on the American body politic. Every day, Trump is saying and doing things—attacking journalists, calling entire races of humans “garbage,” signing off on a national security strategy that urges America to help far-right nationalist parties seize power in Europe, demanding that commentators who write things he doesn’t like be tried for treason, mocking the murder of a political opponent—that would get most elementary school children first suspended and then, if they didn’t make a good-faith effort to shape up, expelled.\n\nI can almost see the letter from the principal to Donald’s disappointed parents:\n\nDear Mr. and Mrs Trump,\n\nIt is with great reluctance that my colleagues and I have come to the conclusion that your son is no longer a good fit for our school. We are deeply concerned that he is demonstrating profoundly antisocial tendencies, and while we have repeatedly urged your family to seek professional help for your son, it appears that our suggestions have gone unheeded. The situation has, unfortunately, now reached a breaking point.\n\nAs you know, when Donald began insulting girls out on the schoolyard by calling them “piggy,” “stupid,” and “ugly,” we explained to him that this was not how a little boy is supposed to talk to other people. He responded sullenly and seemed particularly angered by the fact that it was one of his female teachers who tried to impart some manners.\n\nNot long afterward, your son began lashing out at students of Somali-American heritage, going so far as to call all members of that group “garbage” and demanding that they leave the school and return to the “shit hole” country that their ancestors left. We hope you will agree that this is simply shocking language, and that a child of Donald’s age should know better than to talk about other human beings in this disparaging way. He has, after all, been at school for six years by now, more than enough time to learn that talking like this is unacceptable.\n\nOur dismay at Donald’s crude language has, however, recently morphed into a more active concern for the safety of his fellow pupils and our staff. When the school counselor tried to suggest that he might benefit from some anger management counseling, Donald lashed out in an objectively intimidating manner. In a long, meandering social media post—apparently written in the middle of the night—that was flagged and referred to local law enforcement, he declared that anyone who dared to question his emotional or physical well-being ought to be tried for sedition and treason; he also let it be known that in the olden days the penalty for such crimes was death.\n\nThat was followed up by what can only be described as a poisonous response to a homework assignment asking how America should interact with its closest political allies. Donald’s 29-page answer was, we are sorry to say, one of the most racist texts we have ever read from a child of his age. Donald urged America to ally with fascist parties throughout Europe to “save Western civilization from erasure,” declared that America’s enormous military might should now be turned against immigrants, and sided with extremist Christian nationalists who do not respect the separation of church and state that is a fundamental part of the United States’s identity. Worried about what sorts of materials Donald was reading online, we referred the text to our district headquarters; the district replied that it was deeply alarmed that Donald was accessing extremist websites and pointed out numerous sentences that could have been lifted whole-cloth from Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik’s “manifesto,” penned shortly before he killed 77 teenagers at a political summer camp.\n\nThe last straw, however, was your son’s extraordinarily callous response to the recent murder of cultural icon Rob Reiner. Three months ago, when the far-right activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down, Donald’s classmate little Stevie Miller made a fiery speech quite literally calling down the wrath of God on anyone who didn’t mourn the killing vociferously enough. Stevie and Donald joined together to attack other students who they deemed insufficiently upset by the murder, even demanding that some of the teachers in this school be fired. We didn’t like how Stevie and Donald acted, but we understood their impulse: someone had been killed, and they wanted everyone to say that that was a bad thing.\n\nToday, however, when news broke that Rob Reiner had been stabbed to death, many students, who can quote large parts of The Princess Bride from memory, were heartbroken. We expected Donald to show the same concern about Reiner’s murder that he had shown for Charlie Kirk. Instead, we discovered to our horror that he had gone onto his Truth Social account immediately after he heard the news and penned a vicious screed mocking the killing and saying it had been caused by Reiner’s dislike of Donald. In fact, in a stunningly narcissistic display, your son announced to the world that Reiner had been killed because his “TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME” had driven others to anger. This was both bizarrely illogical and also deeply offensive to many members of our community.\n\nWe trust you will agree with us that these are entirely inappropriate behaviors from an 11-year-old boy and, taken as a whole, warrant our decision to expel your son from the school. Like any other community, we believe that our school has to be a safe space for its students, and we no longer have confidence in our ability to provide that safe space if your son continues to attend this institution.\n\nWe urge you both to seek whatever services you can to help your son. Our concern is that unless his behavior—which our school psychologist has warned verges on the sociopathic—is checked now he will, as he reaches maturity, almost certainly run afoul of the law.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Trump’s behavior would, indeed, get him expelled from an elementary school. And, I suspect, if my readers—of all political persuasions—were honest with themselves, they would come to the same conclusions. Yet, today, armed with his vicious tongue and his online troll’s persona, he is the most powerful man on earth, his finger on the nuclear trigger, his cabinet meetings obscene, sycophantic displays. Will any of Trump’s cabinet resign in disgust at his vicious remarks about Rob Reiner? Don’t hold your breath. Will any of them seek to invoke the 25th Amendment? Not in a million years.\n\nAnd so, America’s Caligula will continue his mad reign. And all of us will continue to be debased by his grotesqueries.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "fullText": "Pledge to invest billions in UK paused, with Washington citing lack of progress on trade barriers across pond\n\nThe US has paused its promised multi-billion-pound investment into British tech over trade disagreements, marking a serious setback in US-UK relations.\n\nThe £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, hailed by Keir Starmer as “a generational stepchange in our relationship with the US” when it was announced during Donald Trump’s state visit, has been put on ice by Washington.\n\nAs part of the deal, US tech companies pledged to spend billions in the UK, including a £22bn investment from Microsoft and £5bn from Google. But Washington has paused the implementation of the agreement, citing a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nBritish officials sought to downplay the development, which was first reported by the New York Times. The newspaper said Trump’s administration was unhappy about the UK continuing to levy a digital services tax on American tech companies and its food safety rules, which bar the export of certain agricultural products.\n\nOne British government source said it was “the usual bit of hardball negotiations by the Americans” and said that the deal to allow tariff-free British pharmaceutical exports to the US was on and off before it was finalised.\n\n“[The US commerce secretary] Howard Lutnick is a tough guy. We understand that the Americans negotiate incredibly hard but we’ll stand our ground. They want what’s best for their country, we want what’s best for ours,” the source said.\n\nA second government source said the development was “part of the shape of the negotiations” with Washington.\n\nThe prosperity deal included the creation of an artificial intelligence “growth zone” in the north-east of England, which UK officials said could bring in up to £30bn and create 5,000 jobs.\n\nBut the text of the agreement stated that it only “becomes operative alongside substantive progress being made to formalise and implement” it.\n\nThe decision to put it on hold is a blow to the UK government, which touted the agreement as a prize of its intensive year-long engagement with the US to avoid punitive tariffs on British exports. As part of his diplomatic charm offensive, Starmer hosted Trump for a second state visit at Windsor Castle in September, an unprecedented honour for a US president.\n\nStarmer has resisted US pressure to scrap or amend the digital services tax, a 2% levy on the revenues of tech companies including Amazon, Google and Apple that raises about £800m a year. Trump has repeatedly threatened to retaliate against countries with digital taxes, including the UK.\n\nThe Guardian revealed that during trade negotiations in the spring, the government drew up proposals to reduce the amount paid by US tech companies and by applying the tax to a wider range of companies without reducing its total take. But so far the tax has remained unchanged.\n\nThe US has also exerted pressure over the UK’s online safety rules, with officials promising to review their enforcement during the talks.\n\nA third area of contention has been the UK’s food safety regime, with ministers admitting that the US has raised objections to it. As part of the trade deal the government agreed to lower tariffs on some US agricultural products including beef, but it has stood by its manifesto commitment not to water down farming standards.\n\nAny decision to weaken these could open the door to American chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef being sold in Britain, a prospect that has long been highly controversial with farmers and consumer groups.\n\nAt a press conference at Chequers in September, where he unveiled the tech prosperity deal, Starmer said it had “the power to change lives” and “renewed the special relationship for a new era”.\n\n“It’s our chance to ensure that technologies like AI, quantum and others amplify human potential, solve problems, cure diseases, make us richer and freer, strengthen democracy not tyranny,” the prime minister said. “This is the territory on which the future will be won.”\n\nTrump at the time said the deal would help the US and UK “dominate” in the world of artificial intelligence and “ensure our countries lead the next great technological revolution side by side”.\n\nPeter Kyle, the business and trade secretary, was in the US last week for negotiations with Lutnick, the US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. Their discussions touched on whisky and steel tariffs and collaboration on critical minerals. Kyle’s department said talks were due to continue in January.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the UK is firmly committed to ensuring the tech prosperity deal delivers opportunity for hard-working people in both countries.”\n\nThe Guardian reported at the weekend that Starmer was poised to choose his new ambassador to Washington after interviewing the three finalists last week. The three shortlisted candidates are the prime minister’s business adviser, Varun Chandra, who was central to negotiating the prosperity deal; Christian Turner, the incoming ambassador to the UN; and Nigel Casey, the ambassador to Russia.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has revealed the White House’s domestic priority, and it’s not bringing down costs or addressing the looming healthcare crisis.\n\nSpeaking at a holiday party on Sunday, the president described his aspirations for a triumphal arch in Washington, D.C., as White House Domestic Policy Council head Vince Haley’s “primary thing.”\n\n“It’s something that is so special. Uh, it will be like the one in, in Paris, but to be honest with you, it blows it away. Blows it away in every way,” Trump said. “And Vince came in one day and his eyes were teeming. I mean, he couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. He saw it and he wanted to do that. That’s your primary thing.”\n\nHaley previously served as a speechwriter for Trump and as a longtime aide for former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n\n“Vince is unbelievable on policy. And we have a policy thing that’s going to be unbelievable happening,” he said of the proposed arch.\n\nTrump has spent months attempting to remake D.C. in his MAGAfied image, including paving over the White House Rose Garden, demolishing the East Wing, breaking ground on a $300 million ballroom, and announcing plans for other new construction around the nation’s capital—none of which has undergone the necessary legal reviews.\n\nIn October, he announced he wanted to build a knock-off of the Arc de Triomphe that would rival the Lincoln Memorial in scale. Sources say Trump has been presented with three different designs, but unsurprisingly he is reportedly most excited about a $100 million white-and-gold monstrosity.\n\n“We’re building an arc, like the Arc de Triomphe, and we’re building it, uh, by the Arlington Bridge, the Arlington Cemetery, uh, opposite the Lincoln Memorial. You could say Jefferson, Washington, everything, ’cause they’re all right there,” Trump described the project on Sunday.\n\nThe president has solicited private donations for the project, which would ostensibly commemorate the 250th anniversary of the United States, and has doubled down on the idea even as his approval ratings have cratered over his administration’s failure to rein in the cost of living.\n\nThe president’s own voters increasingly blame him for high prices, and last week, Trump launched a national tour to try to convince voters his economic policies are working—despite the fact that many Americans are cutting back on buying gifts this holiday season.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Republicans still don’t have a plan for bringing down healthcare costs after the latest GOP spending bill cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending and failed to extend health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealthcare premiums for about 22 million Americans will skyrocket next year after the ACA credits expire, with the average recipient seeing their premiums double.\n\nBut to Trump, the more pressing issue is apparently that Washington is “the only city in the world that’s of great importance that doesn’t have a triumphal arch,” he said Sunday.\n\n“This one is gonna blow ‘em all away. The one that people know mostly is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France. And, uh, we’re gonna top it by I think a lot,” he said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reportedly grew bored of being warned about his policies and dire polling numbers and instead shifted the conversation to golf.\n\nMark Mitchell, head pollster at the conservative polling firm Rasmussen Reports, spoke with the president at the White House and warned Trump that he is losing support among his MAGA base during his second term.\n\nMitchell was invited to the White House by Vice President JD Vance in the hope that he would offer Trump an outsider’s perspective on how the public views his presidency, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe invitation came as polling has repeatedly shown Trump recording bleak numbers and record-low approval ratings, amid growing concerns that the 79-year-old is not focused on improving the lives of tens of millions of Americans, who are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis and abandoning his “America First” agenda.\n\nMitchell told the Post that while Trump initially listened to his concerns and asked questions, the president eventually changed the subject to golf. That included praising two of his golf buddies—South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Fox News host Bret Baier—and bragging about how much money he had just raised at a golf fundraiser for Graham.\n\n“To the extent that we were talking about the economic populism message, he wasn’t as interested as I would have hoped,” Mitchell said.\n\nPolling has consistently suggested that Trump is facing backlash from voters for downplaying—or outright denying—that millions of Americans are experiencing financial hardship during his second term. Last week, Trump appeared at a rally in Pennsylvania to try to convince voters that his economic policies are working, but instead once again labeled concerns about “affordability” a Democratic “hoax.”\n\nDays later, an AP-NORC poll found that just 31 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, a record low for the president and a nine-point drop since March.\n\nEven the latest survey from the Trump-friendly Rasmussen Reports shows that a majority of likely voters (51 percent) disapprove of the president’s job performance.\n\nThere are growing fears that Trump’s erosion of support among his base could have devastating consequences for Republicans in next year’s midterms, where the GOP already faces an uphill battle to retain control of the House and possibly the Senate.\n\nSpeaking to the Post, Mitchell said he told Trump he had lost the momentum and goodwill he gained from supporters following the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July 2024.\n\n“You said, ‘Fight, fight, fight.’ But nobody ever clarified what that means,” Mitchell said, referring to the defiant fist-raising gesture Trump made in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. “And right now, you’re fight-fight-fighting Marjorie Taylor Greene, and not actually fight-fight-fighting for Americans.”\n\nMitchell added that he warned Trump during the November White House meeting that many supporters believe he has failed to “drain the swamp” in Washington, and that his base wants to see the 79-year-old “smash the oligarchy, not be the oligarchy.”\n\n“Building billionaire-funded ballrooms, jet-setting around the world, and touting trillion-dollar investment deals looks a lot like oligarchy stuff,” Mitchell said.\n\nConservative commentator and Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez also suggested that Trump is becoming overly focused on foreign policy, particularly his desperate efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize, during his second term.\n\n“When Americans see billions of dollars going overseas to any country, it really feels like a betrayal when we’re struggling here at home,” Hernandez told the Post.\n\nTwo senior White House officials told the newspaper that Trump receives feedback on his performance, including criticism from MAGA-aligned voices, on a “near-daily” basis.\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described Trump as the “proud founder and undisputed leader” of MAGA and “the greatest political movement in American history.”\n\n“President Trump is delivering on his core campaign promises across the board, keeping his word to the nearly 80 million patriots who elected him in a landslide, and fighting every day to make America greater than ever before,” she said.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and Vance’s office for comment.",

The filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration said in a court filing Monday that the president’s White House ballroom construction project must continue for unexplained national security reasons and because a preservationists' organization that wants it stopped has no standing to sue.\n\nThe filing was in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt President Donald Trump's project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and a public comment period and wins approval from Congress.\n\nThe administration's 36-page filing included a declaration from Matthew C. Quinn, deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for the security of the president and other high-ranking officials, that said more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.” The filing did not explain the specific national security concerns; the administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in a private, in-person setting without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe East Wing had sat atop a emergency operations bunker for the president.\n\nQuinn said even a temporary halt to construction would “consequently hamper” the agency's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations and its protective mission.\n\nA hearing in the case was scheduled for Tuesday in federal court in Washington.\n\nThe government’s response offered the most comprehensive look yet at the ballroom construction project, including a window into how it was so swiftly approved by the Trump administration bureaucracy and its expanding scope.\n\nThe filings assert that final plans for the ballroom have yet to be finalized despite the continuing demolition and other work to prepare the site for eventual construction. Below-ground work on the site continues, wrote John Stanwich, the National Park Service’s liaison to the White House, and work on the foundations is set to begin in January. Above-ground construction “is not anticipated to begin until April 2026, at the earliest,” he wrote.\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation did not respond to email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe privately funded group last week asked the U.S. District Court to block Trump's project.\n\n“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”\n\nTrump had the East Wing torn down in October as part of his plan to build an estimated $300 million, 90,000-square-foot (27,432-square-meter) ballroom able to accommodate about 1,000 people before his term ends in January 2029. He says presidents before him long have wanted an event space larger than the rooms currently at the White House, and says the ballroom would end the practice of entertaining visiting foreign dignitaries in large, temporary pavilions on the south grounds.\n\nThe Trust asserts that the plans should have been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before any action was taken. The lawsuit notes that the Trust wrote to those entities and the National Park Service on Oct. 21, after East Wing demolition began, urging a stop to the project and asking the administration to comply with federal law, but received no response.\n\nThe lawsuit cites several federal statutes and rules detailing the role the planning and fine arts commission and lawmakers play in U.S. government construction projects.\n\nThe administration argued in its response that the president has the authority to modify the White House and included the extensive history of changes and additions to the Executive Mansion since it was built more than 200 years ago. It also asserted that the president is not subject to the statutes cited by the plaintiffs.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys said in the filing that the plaintiff's claims about the East Wing demolition are “moot” because the tear-down cannot be undone. The administration also argues that claims about future construction are “unripe” because the plans are not final.\n\nThe administration also contends that the Trust cannot establish “irreparable harm” because above-ground construction is not expected until spring. It argues that the reviews sought in the lawsuit, consultation with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, “will soon be underway without this Court's involvement.”\n\nTrump's ballroom project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among his political adversaries, but the lawsuit is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop his plans for an addition that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing was torn down.\n\nIn 2000, the National Park Service's Comprehensive Design Plan for the White House first identified the need for a larger event space to address an increase in visitors and to provide a venue suitable for major events, according to the administration's filing.",

    "description": "Dec 15 () - Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and ​weakening EV demand.",
    "fullText": "Dec 15 (Reuters) - Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry's retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration's policies and ​weakening EV demand.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will ‌pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an EREV, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping ‌a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.\n\nInstead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.\n\nFord will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in ⁠the fourth quarter and continuing through next year ‌and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5 billion is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6 billion is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5 billion on what Ford called “program-related ‍expenses.”\n\nThe automaker also raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before taxes and interest, to about $7 billion, up from a previous range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.\n\nFord’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook ​for electrics dimmed significantly this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could ‌encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.\n\nU.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.\n\n“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.",

The lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

It included parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech, which took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.\n\nThe BBC spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, accusing it of defamation over editing of his Jan. 6 speech\n\nTrump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a “false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,” calling it “a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence” the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt accused the BBC of “splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021” in order to ”intentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.”\n\nAbrego Garcia is still hoping to find justice after his wrongful deportation, his lawyer says\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia wasn’t an activist and he didn’t choose to become locked into what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press.\n\nBut as he experiences some of the few days he’s had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he’s still hoping for a just resolution to his case.\n\n“He’s been through a lot, and he’s still fighting,” said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia’s court-ordered release from detention last week. “What it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he’s still fighting.”\n\nAbrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to Trump’s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.\n\n▶ Read more about Abrego Garcia’s case\n\nSen. Mark Kelly’s attorney warns Trump administration of ‘dangerous overreach’\n\nThe attorney’s letter comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Democratic senator who was among a group of lawmakers in a video calling on military personnel to defy “illegal orders.”\n\n“There is no legitimate basis for any type of proceeding against Senator Kelly, and any such effort would be unconstitutional and an extraordinary abuse of power,” wrote Paul J. Fishman in the letter to Navy Secretary John Phelan.\n\nTrump himself had lashed out at the lawmakers, who all have military backgrounds after years of service.\n\nKelly’s attorney warned of legal action if the department sought to pursue the senator in any forum — “criminal, disciplinary, or administrative.”\n\nFishman wrote they would “take all appropriate legal action on Senator Kelly’s behalf to halt the Administration’s unprecedented and dangerous overreach.”\n\nSecret Service official says ballroom construction doesn’t yet meet agency’s security standards\n\nIn its Monday court filing, the Trump administration included a declaration from the deputy director of the U.S. Secret Service saying more work on the site of the former White House East Wing is still needed to meet the agency’s “safety and security requirements.”\n\nThe administration has offered to share classified details with the judge in-person without the plaintiffs present.\n\nThe project has prompted criticism in the historic preservation and architectural communities, and among Trump’s political adversaries, but the lawsuit by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded group, is the most tangible effort thus far to alter or stop the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) addition.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to block construction until the project goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification.\n\nTrump administration says White House ballroom construction is a matter of national security\n\nFor that reason, the construction project must continue, the Trump administration said in a court filing Monday.\n\nThe filing came in response to a lawsuit filed last Friday by the National Trust for Historic Preservation asking a federal judge to halt the project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.\n\nExecutive order directs whole of government mobilization against drug traffickers\n\nThe order instructs the State and Treasury departments to pursue the financial assets of and sanctions on financial institutions and groups involved in fentanyl trafficking. It also calls for greater cooperation between the Pentagon and Justice Department on fentanyl and drug trafficking issues.\n\nThe order directs the homeland security secretary to “identify threat networks related to fentanyl smuggling” by using intelligence resources that in the past were devoted to the detection of other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe federal government by law has a wide range of national security and law enforcement capabilities to combat drug smuggling, including asset forfeiture, targeted arrests and surveillance of criminal organizations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s earlier this year designated some drug cartels as terror groups, a move that may unlock more coordination between the armed forces and domestic law enforcement but has been questioned by legal analysts over its scope and legality.\n\nWisconsin judge allows case against former Trump aides to proceed to trial\n\nA Wisconsin judge has ruled there is enough evidence to proceed to trial in a felony forgery case against an attorney and an aide to President Donald Trump related to action taken after 2020 election.\n\nThe judge on Monday at a preliminary hearing found there was probable cause to proceed with the charges after taking testimony from a special agent with the state Department of Justice who detailed the allegations.\n\nThe charges relate to attempts by the former aides to present a slate of Republican electors to Congress falsely claiming that Trump had won Wisconsin that year.\n\nFormer Trump attorney Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman were in court for the hearing but did not testify. The judge postponed the preliminary hearing for a third person charged, Ken Chesebro, amid questions about what comments he made to prosecutors could be admitted in court.\n\nPence’s group urges Trump to fire RFK Jr.\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence’s group Advancing American Freedom on Monday called on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over what the group argues has been a slow-walked safety review of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone.\n\nKennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary have pledged to review the drug’s safety but are facing mounting pressure from abortion opponents to move more quickly. Mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago, has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.\n\nIn a statement alongside Monday’s memo, the Republican Pence accused Kennedy of being unable or unwilling to keep promises to abortion opponents and said he should step aside.\n\nThe attacks come as Kennedy has faced criticism from both sides but also waves of support as he seeks to dramatically reshape the nation’s health agencies and target vaccines.\n\nTrump again says he’s ended hostilities between Thailand and Cambodia. But fighting continues\n\nThe two countries agreed to a ceasefire in July, and formalized the deal in October when Trump was in Malaysia. But lately, fighting has resumed. Trump on Friday said he had called the leaders and got them to agree to another truce -- but officials said heavy combat continues.\n\nNevertheless, Trump on Monday said in the Oval Office that “we were able to straighten that out.”\n\nThe two countries were “having a little problem yesterday,” Trump said. “I called them and I said, ‘look, fellas, relax. You gotta take it easy.’ They started the war again, and I got it ended.”\n\nTrump says he has asked Xi to free Jimmy Lai\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he feels “so badly” about Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media mogul who on Monday was convicted in a landmark national security case.\n\nLai, 78, now could spend the rest of his life in prison. On Monday, Trump confirmed that he has brought up Lai’s case with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and asked for Lai’s release.\n\n“I spoke to President XI about it, and I asked to consider his release,” Trump said. “He’s not well, he’s an older man, and he’s not well, so I did put that request out. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nIn London and Washington, Jimmy Lai’s children have expressed gratitude for the support from the Trump administration.\n\nPresident Trump praises José Antonio Kast’s win in Chilean presidential election\n\nTrump touted the win by Kast, a far right conversative who comfortably defeated his left-of-center opponent in Sunday’s election, as a sign of his broader influence on politics across the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I look forward to pay my respects to him here,” Trump said of Kast. “He’s a very good person.”\n\nKast is the most conservative candidate to win Chile’s presidential election in 35 years. He won 58.2% of the votes on a campaign heavily centered on crime and immigration.\n\nTrump defends Syria’s new leader after attack that killed three Americans\n\nTrump said Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa “feels very badly” about an attack over the weekend that claimed the lives of two Iowa National Guard members and a U.S. civilian.\n\nTrump said the attack happened in a region of Syria that the new government doesn’t control.\n\n“This had nothing to do with him,” said Trump, speaking of al-Sharaa. He hosted al-Sharaa at the White House in November.\n\n“He feels very badly about it. He’s working on it. He’s a strong man, and this had nothing to do with the Syrian government,” Trump said.\n\nThe U.S. military and Trump have blamed the attack on the Islamic State group. Trump has threatened to retaliate.\n\nTrump defends FBI and calls Brown shooting a ‘school problem’\n\nTrump defended the FBI after a mass shooting at Brown University, arguing that questions about the case should be directed to officials at the Ivy League school in Rhode Island.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that authorities do not yet know a motive in the shooting that killed two and injured others.\n\nPressed about why the FBI has not been able to identify a shooter, Trump called it a “school problem.” Brown “had their own guards, they had their own police and their own everything,” he said.\n\nTrump told reporters to “ask that question, really, to the school, not to the FBI,” which he said “came in after the fact.”\n\nHe said the FBI “will do a good job,” and cited the Charlie Kirk assassination as an example. In that case, the alleged killer’s family helped turn him in to authorities.\n\nTrump says the administration is considering changing how it treats marijuana\n\n“We are considering the idea because a lot of people want to see it,” the president said.\n\nTrump had said in August that he was reviewing whether the federal government should reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. Such a step could move the federal government closer to an approach already embraced by many states.\n\n“We are looking at that very strongly,” Trump said at the White House.\n\nTrump doubles down on criticizing Reiner and calls him ‘deranged’\n\nThe president was asked if he stood by his social media post in light of the pushback he was getting, including from those in his own party.\n\nUsing the third person, Trump said Reiner “was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned.”\n\n“I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way shape or form,” Trump said. “I thought he was very bad for our country.”\n\nTrump signs executive order classifying fentanyl as a ‘weapon of mass destruction’\n\nHe signed the order in the Oval Office on Monday while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine, White House border czar Tom Homan and other top military officials.\n\nTrump says his administration is “formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is. No bomb does what this is doing.”\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the new designation would affect administration policy or what the legal implications would be for those impacted by fentanyl use or drug traffickers.\n\nThe term weapon of mass destruction has typically referred to nuclear, biological, chemical or kinetic threats capable of causing overwhelming and lasting damage to a population, infrastructure or environment. The term has also been hotly debated in American politics since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nTrump is recognizing 13 military service members with a Mexican Border Defense Medal\n\nThe president is in the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump border czar Tom Homan, all of them hailing the border defense portion of his immigration crackdown.\n\nMilitary commanders and the award recipients looked on as Trump, Hegseth and Homan declared the border secure. Trump said his administration has “stopped the invasion in its tracks, and we are dismantling the cartels very rapidly.”\n\nHe added many hits from his 2024 campaign speech, blasting the immigration policies of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and declaring migrants who crossed the border “some of the worst people on Earth.”\n\nHoman praised “greatest president of my lifetime – yes, I said it.” Hegseth said the medal is a reprisal of a military honor awarded previously in the early 20th century\n\nTrump expresses optimism that Russia-Ukraine war is nearing the end\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump said while recapping war talks in Europe at the start of an unrelated White House event.\n\nTrump said he had a “long talk” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He also spoke with the leaders of several European countries, including Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom as well as NATO.\n\n“Things are going along pretty well,” the president said.\n\nTrump said everyone wants to see the war end.\n\nPresident Trump to deliver remarks in North Carolina on Friday\n\nThe president’s upcoming trip to Rocky Mount was confirmed by Republican Senate candidate Michael Whatley, a close Trump ally who was chair of the Republican National Committee during the 2024 election.\n\n“Let’s give him the North Carolina welcome he deserves,” Whatley wrote on social media. Whatley did not describe a reason for the trip in his social media post.\n\nThe event will take place at the Rocky Mount Events Center. Trump last week traveled to Pennsylvania to discuss the economy and cost of living.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson urges an appeal to ‘our better angels’ after weekend violence\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of tragedies,” the GOP speaker said as he arrived at the Capitol.\n\nHe drew on scripture to provide comfort to the Reiner family and others after “the senseless violence” this past weekend in Australia and at Brown University.\n\n“We have to appeal to our better angels,” Johnson said, and “I think we have to amplify those voices.”He declined to answer questions about Trump’s insensitive remarks after Reiner’s death.\n\nUS, Paraguay sign agreement setting out legal basis for American troops in the country\n\nThe United States and Paraguay have signed an agreement laying out the legal framework for American troops to be stationed the in the South American country and clearing the way for further defense and intelligence cooperation between the two as the Trump administration steps up military operations throughout the western hemisphere.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Ramirez signed the so-called “status of forces” agreement on Monday at the State Department. Both men hailed the deal as a step forward in relations that would enhance already strong counter-terrorism and -narcotics measures.\n\nSuch agreements outline the legal requirements and immunities for U.S. troops to be present in other countries, although there was no immediate announcement of any deployments to Paraguay.\n\nCalifornia hires two former CDC officials who rebuffed Trump, Kennedy\n\nCalifornia is hiring two former top federal health officials, state officials said Monday.\n\nSusan Monarez, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is helping California launch an effort to maintain trust in science-driven decision-making and improve public health infrastructure.\n\nMonarez is being joined by Dr. Debra Houry, CDC’s former chief medical officer. Both will be advisors, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.\n\nThe White House fired Monarez in August when she fell out of favor with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after only one month on the job. Houry and some other top CDC officials resigned in protest.\n\nA few Republicans speak out against Trump post on Reiner\n\nA few Republican members of Congress are calling out President Donald Trump’s insensitive social media post regarding the deaths of director-actor Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted ox X that regardless of how one felt about Reiner, “this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.”\n\nRep. Mike Lawler of New York said of Trump’s post: “This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son. It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nAnd Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia tweeted: “This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies. Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nNY Attorney General Letitia James makes first comments on the repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her\n\nJames said Monday she isn’t spending a lot of time thinking about the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to revive a criminal case against her.\n\nJames, a Democrat, made her first public comments about the matter at an unrelated press conference after the news last week that a second federal grand jury had declined to indict her on charges related to her purchase of a home in Norfolk, Virginia, in 2020.\n\n“I don’t really spend a lot of time focused on this campaign of retribution,” said James. “I’ve got a lot of work on my hands — standing up and defending the rights of New Yorkers, protecting them from harms coming from Washington, D.C.”\n\nA judge last month threw out an indictment charging James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the case at Republican President Donald Trump’s urging was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.\n\n“I’ve got a job to do,” said James, who had pleaded not guilty to the earlier indictment and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nPoll shows health costs are a rising concern among Americans\n\nAbout 3 in 10 Americans cite the cost of health care as the most urgent health problem facing the country, and about one-quarter say the health care system is in “crisis,” according to a new Gallup poll released Monday.\n\nThe poll also shows that only 16% of Americans are satisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S.\n\nThe findings from the survey conducted in November come as Congress has yet to address the spiking health insurance premium costs facing millions of Americans when Affordable Care Act health subsidies expire at the start of the new year.\n\nIt also comes as health expenses have risen across the board in response to a variety of factors, including inflation and the increasing use of expensive medications such as GLP-1 weight loss drugs.\n\nHunter Biden disbarred in Connecticut after complaints about federal convictions\n\nBiden agreed to the penalty and admitted to violating the state’s attorney conduct rules, but he did not admit to committing any crimes.\n\nHis father, former President Joe Biden, pardoned him last year after he was convicted of three felonies relating to a 2018 gun purchase and pleaded guilty to failing to pay federal taxes. He previously was disbarred in Washington, D.C.\n\nA Connecticut judge ordered the disbarment on Monday. Hunter Biden did not speak and he and his lawyer appeared via video at the virtual court hearing in Waterbury.\n\nThe judge found that Hunter Biden violated several lawyer ethics rules, including engaging in conduct “involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.”\n\nIn a court document, Hunter Biden admitted to some but not all of the misconduct allegations. The judge also cited the Washington disbarment. He was admitted to the Connecticut bar in 1997, a year after graduating from Yale Law School.\n\nWhite House views Russian openness to Ukraine joining the EU as a big deal\n\nThe U.S. officials who briefed reporters after Witkoff and Kushner met with Zelenskyy and other European officials in Berlin over the last two days said such an offer over Ukraine joining the EU would be a major concession by Moscow. But Russia has previously said it doesn’t object to Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "description": "The defamation lawsuit's allegations focus on the footage of President Donald Trump's January 6, 2021, speech.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has sued the BBC for defamation over a documentary that his lawyers say presents a \"false and defamatory\" portrayal of him.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump's lawyers filed a civil complaint in a federal court in Florida, seeking at least $5 billion in damages from the British broadcaster.\n\nThe 46-page lawsuit claims that the BBC has defamed Trump in a Panorama documentary that aired about a week before the 2024 election, called \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" The complaint alleges the program presented a \"false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of Trump.\n\nThe suit's allegations focus on how the documentary was edited, specifically regarding footage of Trump's January 6, 2021, speech near the White House.\n\n\"President Trump's powerhouse lawsuit is holding the BBC accountable for its defamation and reckless election interference just as he has held other fake news mainstream media responsible for their wrongdoing,\" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team told Business Insider.\n\nThe filing included correspondence that Trump and the BBC's legal team exchanged in November.\n\nTrump's attorney, Alejandro Brito, wrote a letter to the BBC on November 9, demanding that it retract \"false and defamatory statements\" about Trump. Brito threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion if it did not comply.\n\nThe BBC's legal team wrote back on November 13, saying that the BBC had \"no intention of misleading anyone\" and included a copy of the outlet's apology letter to Trump. The correspondence said that Trump did not have a basis for a defamation claim.\n\nIn a separate online statement on the same day, the BBC said the outlet and its chair, Samir Shah, were \"sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021.\"\n\n\"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms,\" the statement said. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"\n\nThe BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis is a developing story; please check back for updates.",

    "fullText": "The decision means TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of Trump’s pen\n\nJudicial opinions allowing the government to suppress speech in the name of national security rarely stand the test of time. But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning TikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.\n\nCongress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.\n\nMany first amendment advocates and scholars – including the two of us – expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.\n\nBut the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulous opinion issued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.\n\nPrivacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThis is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as the House committee report on the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.\n\nAnd courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.\n\nDuring the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.\n\nEvents since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment, Donald Trump issued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nSince then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.\n\nEven worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.\n\nWhether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trump has been brokering a deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.\n\nPlainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.\n\nThe court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.\n\nOver the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.\n\nEvelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School\n\nJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON ― Several Republicans in the House of Representatives rebuked President Donald Trump on Monday over his creepy social media post about the killing of director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Reiner.\n\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) ― right-wingers who’ve been on the president’s bad side lately ― reacted with disgust to Trump musing that the two were murdered because of Reiner’s “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nPolitics: Pinched By Higher Prices, Many Trump Voters Say: Don't Blame The President\n\n“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” Massie wrote on X, above an image of the president’s post.\n\n“I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it,” Massie said.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), a moderate, also chimed in.\n\n“This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son,” Lawler wrote. “It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nRegardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.

I challenge anyone to defend it. pic.twitter.com/j3dvzRxLQJ\n\n— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 15, 2025\n\nTrump wrote Monday that the couple had died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”\n\nReiner, director of films including “The Princess Bride” and “When Harry Met Sally,” had criticized Trump, once calling him “the single-most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States.”\n\nPolitics: Detail In 1 New Epstein Estate Pic Makes CNN Anchor Pause: 'Can't Believe I Have To Read This'\n\nThe Reiners were found stabbed to death in their home on Sunday. Police have arrested their 32-year-old son but haven’t announced charges. The younger Reiner has struggled with addiction and homelessness.\n\nGreene denounced Trump’s message within minutes of Massie.\n\n“This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Greene wrote. “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nGreene was one of Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress before their falling-out this year over her support of Massie’s legislation to force the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the late ****** predator who was Trump’s friend.\n\nPolitics: Critics ‘Horrified’ By Trump’s 3 Words About Brown University Shooting\n\nEven though they’ve clashed with Trump, the posts by Massie, Greene and Lawler were remarkable ― for a decade, most elected Republicans have sought to avoid commenting on Trump’s outrageous social media activity. Lawmakers typically tell reporters they haven’t had a chance to see what the president has said.\n\nEarlier this year, after the president posted a video of himself piloting a jet that dumped excrement on “No Kings” protesters, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) laughed off a question by saying Trump is just a great poster.\n\n“The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that,” Johnson said.\n\nThe spontaneous public criticism from members of Johnson’s conference on Monday is another small signal that Trump’s grip on his party has slipped.\n\nPolitics: Marjorie Taylor Greene Says She Feels Sorry For Trump\n\nJenna Ellis, a member of Trump’s 2020 campaign legal team, also condemned his comments.\n\n“The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk’s death,” Ellis wrote on X. “This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.”\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post\n\nRob And Michele Reiner's Son In Custody After Stabbing Deaths\n\nOBITUARY: Rob Reiner, Son Of A Comedy Giant Who Became One Himself, Dead At 78",

    "description": "Trump is expanding short-term credential programs through the Workforce Pell grant, while the debate over the value of a college degree continues.",
    "fullText": "The four-year college degree no longer has the same pull it once did — and the Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe Department of Education concluded its negotiations on the Workforce Pell program on December 12, a new initiative included in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe program would extend Pell grants to low-income borrowers in short-term certification programs, with the intention of providing more funding for alternative paths to a four-year college degree or trade school.\n\nNicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, acknowledged during remarks at the beginning of negotiations that a standard four-year college degree is losing its value.\n\n\"Americans are questioning whether the value of higher education is worth the cost. Polling also shows that students do not believe they are graduating with the specific skills that they need,\" Kent said. He added that skepticism about college degrees has led to students \"showing more interest in pathways that get them into the labor force more quickly and without unnecessary debt.\"\n\nCollege still remains the primary path in the US for postsecondary education, and recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that it continues to lead to higher earnings. In addition, proponents argue the value of college extends beyond earnings to social opportunities and exposure to new ideas.\n\nHowever, high student debt loads and a growing number of jobs eliminating degree requirements have sparked a growing interest in short-term credential programs and the trades, which the Trump administration is attempting to boost.\n\nChris Madaio, a senior advisor at the nonprofit The Institute for College Access and Success, told Business Insider that with more Pell grant support extended to short-term programs, it's likely that more schools will offer them and more students will enroll.\n\n\"I think it's all ensuring that students take what's right for them,\" Madaio said. \"These programs should pay off for students, and they should give a good value and use students' limited lifetime Pell grant eligibility for something that's going to work for them and potentially allow them to get a job later down the road.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's Workforce Pell proposal will have a period of public comment before it is set to be implemented in July 2026.\n\nIf the rule is implemented as proposed, eligibility guidelines would vary by state. According to the department, each state will determine what qualifies as a high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand job based on what aligns with the industry needs in that state. For example, a state where agriculture dominates the economy might choose to prioritize short-term programs in that field.\n\nMadaio said that this state variance is by design: \"It's really important that states are taking a close look at what they're approving to ensure that there are jobs in that state and that these are valuable workforce training programs for jobs that are needed in that state.\"\n\nAccountability is key here, Madaio said, and states should ensure that schools are delivering on the value of the programs they offer. Otherwise, students could be left paying off loans they cannot afford — and that's something that the gainful employment rule, which the department is set to negotiate in January, will address.\n\n\"These are really positive developments that show that there's a broad agreement across the political spectrum that we owe it to students to make sure that the programs that they're investing in are going to provide a quality education and that they're going to get something out of it,\" Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider.\n\nSome high schools across the country are working to shift the emphasis away from a four-year college as the only option. Business Insider previously visited a public high school in rural Wyoming, for example, that works to equip students for college, career, or the workforce, giving students the freedom to choose the path that best suits their interests.\n\nOverall, the higher education financing landscape is undergoing significant changes. In addition to the negotiations on Workforce Pell and gainful employment, the Department of Education recently concluded negotiations on a repayment overhaul that condenses the number of existing repayment plans, replacing them with less generous options that could lead to higher payments and shorter timelines to debt relief for student-loan borrowers.\n\nAs the slew of higher education changes takes effect, Madaio said that students should expect to see more advertising for short-term programs that are funded by grants. He recommended that students closely examine the actual costs of a program and its outcomes to avoid predatory behavior by schools.\n\n\"A critical piece is for students to do their homework when deciding on a certificate credential program, and then consider what kind of jobs they can get for that, and are those things that they need the training for?\" Madaio said.",

    "fullText": "“Saturday Night Live” relocated their cold open onto Air Force One this week, taking in the loopy energy of Donald Trump‘s end-of-day interviews. James Austin Johnson‘s Trump, addled by Ambien and Adderall, expounded on Caribbean boat strikes and found the time to lash out at CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.\n\nThe proud Trump of “SNL” showed off his latest airstrike video, an obvious attack on Santa’s sleigh, to the horror of the gathered reporters.\n\n“Was that Santa?” a confused reporter asked.\n\nThe faux-Trump repeatedly waxed poetic about White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s lips, a detail that feels like “SNL” laying it on thick that is actually ripped from the headlines.\n\n“Look at those lips. They go bop-bop-bop like a machine gun, just spectacular. I’m a married man. I’m obsessed with this woman,” he said. “She liked it because I’m very nice to women.”\n\nJust then, the sketch’s Trump noticed that Collins had a question.\n\n“You have a question, you nasty, horrible witch?” he said.\n\n“That’s actually one of the nicest things you’ve called me,” she replied.\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\n\nThe actual Trump has turned attacking the reporters who follow him a near-daily routine, but he’s been particularly vicious to CNN anchor Collins.\n\n“Caitlin Collin’s of Fake News CNN, always Stupid and Nasty, asked me why the new Ballroom was costing more money than originally thought one year ago,” he wrote on Truth Social earlier this month. “FAKE NEWS CNN, and the guy who runs the whole corrupt operation that owns it, is one of the worst in the business. Their ratings are so low that they’re not even counted or relevant anymore.”\n\nCollins responded to the dig on Instagram, noting that she didn’t actually ask Trump about his massive and costly ballroom.\n\n“Technically, my question was about Venezuela,” she said.\n\nWatch the skit below via YouTube:\n\nThe post “You nasty, horrible witch”: Trump attacks Kaitlan Collins, strikes Santa’s sleigh on “SNL” appeared first on Salon.com.",

President Donald Trump has astounded viewers of the 126th Army-Navy football game with his unique approach to flipping a coin.\n\nWhile officiating the customary coin toss at the historic football clash at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland, Trump demonstrated a bizarre heaving motion that resulted in almost no actual flipping of the coin itself.\n\nTaking the coin with a pinched left hand, and placing it into the open palm of his right, the president heaved the coin forward, sending it in a feeble, plunging arc. Helpfully, he pointed out where the coin had landed after it hit the ground.\n\nViewers immediately expressed their surprise at this pioneering method of coin-based decision-making.\n\n“Donald Trump may have executed the single worst coin flip in history,” wrote former independent congressional candidate Hal Stewart. “That coin is headed to the hall of shame!”\n\n“President Trump with the unprecedented coin toss that doesn’t appear to flip at all,” wrote author and radio host Clay Travis.\n\n“Donald Trump flips a coin like a pansy,” added political commentator Ed Krassenstein.\n\nHowever, the shock and surprise may be unwarranted as Trump has form in this area. In fact, as he has previously demonstrated, the president appears to believe that this is exactly how coins are flipped.\n\nIn 2018, Trump demonstrated his idiosyncratic style at that year’s Army-Navy Game, drawing critical fire from then-MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\n“Why is everything with this president so weird and so awkward?” Hayes asked. “Flipping a coin is not some great feat of athletics.”\n\n“To flip a coin, you just have to, uh, flip the coin. You use the thumb, you flick it into the air, get a good rotation going, let it land on the ground, see if it’s heads or tails.”\n\nThe All In host described Trump’s efforts as how one might release a baby bird into the air.\n\nThe Army Black Knights correctly called the coin in Saturday’s game tails. That did not, however, help them win, as the Navy Shipmen beat them in a close 17-16 game.",

    "fullText": "Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure\n\nFor states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it’s implemented.\n\nThe Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.\n\nAnalysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office’s projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients’ Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nChenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida’s college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.\n\nPhysicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.\n\nA recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it’s important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.\n\n“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.\n\n“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.\n\nThe FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.\n\nWhile Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.\n\nChagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.\n\n“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.\n\nBut this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.\n\n“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump raged in a dead-of-night social media post at Republicans who defied him on a plan that would have given the GOP more seats in Congress.\n\nThe Indiana State Senate voted down a redistricting plan Trump pushed hard to give Republicans two more congressional seats, defeating it by a 31-19 margin — including a majority of Republicans.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about the vote just after it happened, he downplayed his role in supporting the plan:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wasn’t working on it very hard. Would have been nice, I think we would have picked up two seats, if we did that. You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess, Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does, because he’s done a tremendous disservice.\n\nBut the issue kept Trump awake into the early hours Saturday morning. It was almost one o’clock in the morning when Trump posted a threatening rant to his Truth Social account:\n\nRepublicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves. Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!\n\nThe rant came hours after Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) tried to downplay the significance of the vote and its effect on Trump’s stature.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju asked Johnson, on Friday, “Are you worried about Trump’s grip on power after Indiana? Do you think it shows he’s a lame duck?”\n\n“Not at all! No, he is not a lame duck!” Johnson said. “He’s the most powerful president of this generation and many others. We have a lot more work to do together. The outcome in Indiana is inconsequential to that.”\n\nThe post Trump Rages In Dead Of Night At Republicans Who Defied Him On Election Map — After Claiming He Hadn’t ‘Worked Very Hard’ On It first appeared on Mediaite.",

Our country’s going to be strong, safe, rich, it’s going to be great. We’re going to make America great again!”\n\nHe also made waves in October with a video posted to Truth Social that showed him ruling for thousands of years, all the way up to the year 90,000 and beyond, ending with a sign that simply read, ‘TRUMP 4EVA.’\n\nThe president’s official merch store even began selling ‘Trump 2028’ hats in April, encouraging supporters to “make a statement” by wearing them.\n\nOthers in Trump’s orbit have also hinted at a potential circumvention of the 22nd Amendment, including Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who said in November that he was in talks with “one of the top constitutional lawyers” in the U.S. about the potential paths to a third Trump term.\n\n“As he works through this, his quote to me is ‘Bannon, you can drive a Mack truck through the 22nd Amendment,’” Bannon recounted on his War Room podcast, adding, “So, suck on that.”\n\nBannon also told The Economist in an October interview that there were “many different alternatives” to overcoming the 22nd Amendment.\n\n“At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28,” Bannon said.\n\nOthers, like former DOGE head Elon Musk, have also expressed support for continued MAGA control of the White House, albeit with Vice President JD Vance taking over in 2028 instead. Polling currently has Vance leading the pack of preferred potential nominees for 2028, although his lead is shrinking.\n\nPolling released earlier this month found that among voters who backed Trump in 2024, 45 percent oppose the president running for a third term in 2028, and 43 percent support the idea.\n\nBut among all Americans, just 21 percent are in favor of a third Trump term.",

    "fullText": "A coalition of blue states is suing the Trump administration over its fee of $100,000 for H-1B Visas, several Democratic attorneys general announced on Friday.\n\nThe Trump administration announced in September that it would be implementing the fee for H-1B visas, citing that the program for the visas is overused. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, joined by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and New York Attorney General Letitia James and others, is leading the suit.\n\nH-1B visas allow foreign professionals to seek work in professions that are considered to be more specialized. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree or a similar equivalent to be eligible for the visa.\n\nThe liberal attorneys general allege that new policy and fee, which is implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, is out of bounds of what is authorized by Congress for the program.\n\n“Congress has refined this program, setting caps, establishing fees, enhancing enforcement and strengthening protections, but what Congress has never done is authorize a president to impose a six-figure surcharge designed to dismantle the program entirely,” Bonta said at a press conference on Friday.\n\nBonta said the visa fee will create financial burdens on state and private employers, creating a barrier to filling job vacancies.\n\nHe also underscored just how many employees in the United States rely on the H-1B visa program, citing the thousands of health care professionals, educators and researchers, among other occupations, that use the program. Bonta claimed nearly 30,000 educators nationwide hold an H-1B visa, and 17,000 H-1B visa holders last year were health care professionals.\n\nBonta said during the press conference the state of California has filed 49 lawsuits against the Trump administration since they took office in January.\n\n“The bottom line is, no presidential administration can rewrite immigration law,” Bonta said. “No president can destabilize our schools, our hospitals and universities on a whim, and no president can ignore the co-equal branch of government, of Congress, ignore the Constitution or ignore the law.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some featuring powerbrokers like Bill Gates and Larry Summers.\n\nThe photos — which also feature President Donald Trump, ex-Trump advisor Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, writer-director Woody Allen, Richard Branson, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew — are a selection of the over 95,000 photos that the Democrats say were provided to the House Oversight Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nSome of the photos also include Ghislaine Maxwell, a onetime partner of Epstein who was convicted of trafficking girls to him for sex. She's currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nThe committee previously released other records obtained from Epstein's estate, including images of his US Virgin Islands home and tens of thousands of emails and text messages between Epstein and other powerful people.\n\nThe images themselves aren't indications of wrongdoing.\n\nIn many cases, it isn't clear when the photos were taken. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and agreed to register as a pedophile. In 2019, he killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on more severe sex-trafficking charges from federal prosecutors.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement: \"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Gates, Summers, Bannon, Clinton, Allen, Branson, and Mountbatten-Windsor did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that House Democrats are once again \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"\n\nThe latest release of images comes as the Department of Justice readies to release a trove of Epstein-related documents. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, requires the Justice Department to make its files related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell public by December 19.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends,\" Jackson said.\n\nBelow are some of the 19 images that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published on Friday:",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "More shocking images are emerging about some of the things Jeffrey Epstein kept track of on his island. The late child sex offender, it seems, didn’t just have records of the guests who visited his place in the Caribbean.\n\nAmong the physical records he kept were sex toys, according to news reports, including a novelty condom with a likeness to Donald Trump. Behind the table, there’s a sign reading Trump Condom $4.50.\n\nIn addition, there were pics of former US President Bill Clinton with Jeffrey’s girlfriend and conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nSee the newly released photos here: https://t.co/nBf2Y0q1I0\n\n— Oversight Dems (@OversightDems) December 12, 2025\n\nThe details of what transpired on Jeffrey’s island are disturbing enough to hear. All of these new photos add yet another element of shock. The Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published the findings on their X account on Friday, attaching a Dropbox folder for all to see.\n\nDonald and Bill aren’t the only celebrities seen in the photos. Among the others are Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Steve Bannon, Woody Allen, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nIn their big reveal, none of the released photos were dated. Names of potential victims and identifying details were redacted. The latest collection supposedly contains over 95,000 images, with 19 revealed on Friday. Representative Robert Garcia says that these disturbing photos raise more questions about Jeffrey and his relationship with some powerful people. In early December, the Oversight Committee released photos of Jeffrey’s island.\n\nWhile Trump hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in relation to Jeffrey and sex trafficking, their relationship is being scrutinized more than ever. Congress passed a bill to release the Jeffrey Epstein files last month, something which the President officially signed. The deadline to release the details of that investigation is December 19.\n\nTELL US – SHOULD THOSE CELEBRITIES IN THE PHOTOS HAVE TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT THEIR TIME ON JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S ISLAND?\n\nThe post Donald Trump Condoms and Adult Toys: New Jeffrey Epstein Images Released appeared first on Reality Tea.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration is arguing that requiring real-time American Sign Language interpretation of events like White House press briefings “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,\" part of a lawsuit seeking to require the White House to provide the services.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House.\n\nThe National Association for the Deaf sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the cessation of American Sign Language interpretation — which the Biden administration had used regularly — represented “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House’s real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” The group also sued during Trump's first administration, seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a June court filing opposing the association's request for a preliminary injunction, reported Thursday by Politico, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President’s prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” also writing that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration’s image and messaging as he sees fit.”\n\nGovernment attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday on the ongoing lawsuit or answer questions about the administration's argument regarding the damage of interpretation services to Trump's “image.”\n\nIn their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn’t provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association.\n\nAs home to Gallaudet University, the world’s premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out.\n\nLast month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply.\n\nOn his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible\" with the department's mission,\n\nThis week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP",

    "fullText": "Pot stocks are in the green on Friday on news that the White House is considering loosening regulations on cannabis.\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly spoke to House Speaker Sen. Mike Johnson in a phone call on Wednesday, discussing plans to dramatically lower regulatory oversight on cannabis and its derivatives, giving them the same classification as many standard prescription painkillers.\n\nIt's also not the only bullish regulatory development for pot stocks. A proposed bill sponsored by a Florida congressman could allow state residents to cultivate their own cannabis at home. While both catalysts are still speculative, investors are piling in.\n\nHere are the cannabis stocks that are up big on Friday:\n\nRepublicans have historically been against easing cannabis restrictions. When Trump was first elected in 2016, and again in 2024, his win was regarded as bearish for cannabis stocks, but his latest shift is now boosting the whole sector.\n\nAs Business Insider reported, the buzz around cannabis infused drinks may have flatlined after significant hype but that doesn't mean consumers aren't cheering on policy changes that would benefit widespread marijuana use.\n\nRetail investors have piled into Tilray, a former meme stock that remains a popular choice for traders seeking cannabis market exposure. Data from ApeWisdom shows that mentions of Tilray stock across social media have surged 4,800% over the past 24 hours and that 73% of the comments mentioning it were positive.",

    "title": "Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses in his repayment overhaul is facing bipartisan backlash",
    "description": "Over 140 bipartisan lawmakers wrote to oppose the Education Department's plan to place new student-loan limits on nursing programs.",
    "fullText": "Opposition toward new student-loan limits in President Donald Trump's repayment overhaul is mounting.\n\nOn Friday, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent urging him to revise the Department of Education's proposal to place new student-loan limits on professional degree programs.\n\nThe department recently concluded its negotiations on the student-loan payment changes that Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. The changes included borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: a $100,000 lifetime limit for graduate students, and a $200,000 lifetime limit for professional students.\n\nThe crux of the debate centered on which programs qualify as \"professional,\" and the department identified 10 programs, including medicine, dentistry, and law, that would meet its new definition. Post-graduate nursing programs are not included within the professional definition, and the lawmakers wrote that the omission could exacerbate the ongoing nursing shortage.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nThe lawmakers used the example of the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000. They said that the proposed $100,000 cap is \"restricting the pipeline of CRNAs and further limiting an anesthesia workforce that is suffering from shortages across all provider types.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, said in a statement that \"misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion\" about the proposed student-loan limits. Keast cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that, based on data from the College Scorecard, most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. However, advocates still expressed concern about their implications. Jennifer Mensik Kennedy, president of the American Nurses Association, told Business Insider that removing the professional designation for nurses could make it difficult to recruit and retain staff in the industry.\n\n\"It's going to be a really bad revolving issue where we don't have enough faculty to produce enough nurses to replace the nurses who are retiring,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Education is planning to implement these changes beginning in July of 2026, and its proposal is still subject to change based on the comments it receives from the public early next year.",

    "fullText": "President Nayib Bukele entrusting chatbot known for calling itself ‘MechaHitler’ to create ‘AI-powered’ curricula\n\nElon Musk is partnering with the government of El Salvador to bring his artificial intelligence company’s chatbot, Grok, to more than 1 million students across the country, according to a Thursday announcement by xAI. Over the next two years, the plan is to “deploy” the chatbot to more than 5,000 public schools in an “AI-powered education program”.\n\nxAI’s Grok is more known for referring to itself as “MechaHitler” and espousing far-right conspiracy theories than it is for public education. Over the past year, the chatbot has spewed various antisemitic content, decried “white genocide” and claimed Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\n\nNayib Bukele, El Salvador’s president, is now entrusting the chatbot to create curricula in classrooms across the country. Bukele has long embraced technology, making El Salvador the first county in the world to use bitcoin as legal tender, and being one of the first Central American presidents to use Twitter, now X, as a platform. He is also known for ruling with an iron fist and working with Trump to incarcerate deportees to El Salvador’s notorious Cecot prison.\n\n“El Salvador doesn’t just wait for the future to happen; we build it,” Bukele said in a statement about the partnership with xAI. “This partnership is destined to deliver something rather extraordinary for all of humanity.”\n\nMusk touted his partnership with Bukele on Thursday. On X, between posts about “white genocide” and blaming asylum seekers for crime, Musk posted comments about Grok being spread throughout El Salvador’s schools.\n\nHe reposted positively to a comment from Katie Miller, the wife of Trump’s senior adviser Stephen Miller, in which she wrote: “If we are serious about restoring education to math, science and English – why would we allow left leaning liberal [sic] AI our kids? This unlocks non-woke educational tools for our kids.”\n\nxAI is not the first artificial intelligence company to introduce chatbots to public schools. OpenAI announced a partnership with Estonia in February where it could provide all students and teachers in the country’s secondary school system with a customized ChatGPT. Students in rural Colombia also started using Meta’s AI chatbots in 2023 and within a year, teachers began blaming the tech for low grades and failing exams, according to Rest of World.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
