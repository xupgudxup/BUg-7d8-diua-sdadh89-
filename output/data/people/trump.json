    "fullText": "Whistleblower says that Tulsi Gabbard blocked agency from sharing report and delivered it to White House chief of staff\n\nLast spring, the National Security Agency (NSA) detected evidence of an unusual phone call between an individual associated with foreign intelligence and a person close to Donald Trump, according to a whistleblower’s attorney briefed on the existence of the call.\n\nThe highly sensitive communique, which has roiled Washington over the past week, was brought to the attention of the director of national intelligence (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard – but rather than allowing NSA officials to distribute the information further, she took a paper copy of the intelligence directly to the president’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles, the attorney, Andrew Bakaj, said.\n\nOne day after meeting Wiles, Gabbard told the NSA not to publish the intelligence report. Instead, she instructed NSA officials to transmit the highly classified details directly to her office.\n\nDetails of this exchange between Gabbard and the NSA were shared directly with the Guardian and have not been previously reported. Nor has Wiles receipt of the intelligence report.\n\nThe office of the director of national intelligence (ODNI) did not immediately respond to questions about the unusual call detected by the NSA, or Gabbard’s handling of the intelligence.\n\nOn 17 April, a whistleblower contacted the office of the inspector general alleging that Gabbard had blocked highly classified intelligence from routine dispatch, according to Bakaj, who has been briefed on details surrounding the highly sensitive phone call flagged by the NSA. The whistleblower filed a formal complaint about Gabbard’s actions on 21 May, Bakaj said.\n\nFor eight months, the intelligence report has been kept under lock and key, even after the whistleblower pushed to disclose details to congressional intelligence committees.\n\nActing inspector general Tamara A Johnson dismissed the complaint at the end of a 14-day review period, writing in a 6 June letter addressed to the whistleblower that “the Inspector General could not determine if the allegations appear credible”.\n\nThe letter stipulated that the whistleblower could take their concerns to Congress, only after receiving DNI guidance on how to proceed, given the highly sensitive nature of the complaint.\n\nThe independence of the watchdog’s office may be compromised, lawmakers have said, ever since Gabbard assigned one of her top advisers, Dennis Kirk, to work there on 9 May, two weeks after the whistleblower first made contact with the inspector general’s hotline.\n\nGabbard’s office issued its first public acknowledgment of the highly sensitive complaint in a letter addressed to lawmakers on Tuesday, one day after the Wall Street Journal reported on the classified brief. It was posted to the ODNI’s X account, including claims that the inspector general had not informed Gabbard of her obligations to transmit the complaint to Congress.\n\nBakaj said that the ODNI’s office cited various reasons for the delay in intelligence sharing, including the complaints’ top secret classification, the fall government shutdown and the intelligence community inspector general’s failure to notify Gabbard of her reporting requirements.\n\nTwo attorneys and two former intelligence professionals who reviewed details of the incident and ensuing complaint shared with the Guardian have identified what they believe are a series of procedural anomalies that raise questions about Gabbard’s handling of national intelligence and the whistleblower disclosure, which was reported to the inspector general as a matter of “urgent concern”.\n\nMembers of the “gang of eight”, a group of Senate and House leaders privy to classified information from the executive branch, received a heavily redacted version for review on Tuesday night. They have disagreed about the legality of Gabbard’s conduct, as well as the credibility of the whistleblower complaint.\n\nTwo Republican lawmakers dismissed its credibility and backed Gabbard’s conduct, including the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who said in a statement on X that “the DNI took the necessary steps to ensure the material has handled and transmitted appropriately in accordance with law”.\n\nBut Democrats have raised questions about the delay. “The law is clear: when a whistleblower makes a complaint and wants to get it before Congress the agency has 21 days to relay it,” said the senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, in a Thursday press conference. “This whistleblower complaint was issued in May. We didn’t receive it until February.”\n\nWarner said that the months-long delay reflected an effort to “bury the complaint”.\n\nThe contents of the whistleblower complaint are still largely unknown. Bakaj, the whistleblower’s attorney, said that Gabbard’s office had redacted much of the complaint that was released to intelligence committee members on Tuesday, citing executive privilege.\n\n“I don’t know the contents of the complaint, but by exercising executive privilege they are flagging that it involves presidential action,” he said.\n\nOn 3 February, Bakaj again requested guidance from Gabbard’s office about how to share the whistleblower’s full report while taking appropriate precautions.\n\n“As you are well aware, our client’s disclosure directly impacts our national security and the American people,” Bakaj wrote. “This means that our client’s complete whistleblower disclosure must be transmitted to Congress, and that we, as their counsel, speak with members and cleared staff.”\n\nBakaj said that the DNI’s office did not respond to his letter by its Friday deadline. He plans to contact members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Monday to schedule an unclassified briefing on Gabbard’s conduct and the “underlying intelligence concerns”.\n\nMembers of the gang of eight have contacted the NSA to request the underlying intelligence that the whistleblower says Gabbard blocked, according to staff in Warner’s office.\n\nLawmakers can make routine requests for classified information directly from intelligence agencies such as the NSA. The request circumvents the ODNI’s involvement, as well as the office of the inspector general.\n\nThe leading Democrat on the House oversight committee, Stephen F Lynch, wrote a letter to acting inspector general Johnson to warn her that the integrity of the watchdog office could be compromised by Kirk’s May appointment to the group.\n\nKirk served in the first Trump administration and was a co-author of Project 2025, a policy roadmap for restructuring the federal government.\n\n“The appointment of a highly partisan advocate for prioritizing personal loyalty to President Trump above independence and professionalism in the federal government – and one who apparently answers to DNI Gabbard rather than to you – in a senior role within [the intelligence community inspector general’s office] raises troubling questions about the independence of the IC IG,” Lynch wrote.\n\nJohnson did not respond to a request for comment related to this story. She was replaced as the intelligence community inspector general in October by Christopher Fox.",

    "fullText": "The federal Small Business Administration suspended more than 111,000 California borrowers after uncovering $8.6 billion in suspected fraudulent activity linked to the COVID pandemic, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced Friday.\n\n\"We have suspended nearly 112,000 borrowers tied to at least $9 billion in suspected fraud,\" Loeffler said in a press release on Friday. \"This staggering number represents the most significant crack-down on those who defrauded pandemic programs, and it illuminates the scale of corruption that the Biden Administration tolerated for years.\"\n\nThe SBA reported that all in, it suspended 111,620 California borrowers who received 118,489 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) loans, totaling $8.6 billion.\n\nThe Border Gets The Attention While Fraudulent Government Benefits Bleed Taxpayers Dry\n\nPPP loans were a COVID-era federal relief program that gave small businesses money to keep workers on the payroll, while EIDL loans are part of an SBA program that provides low-interest disaster relief loans to help businesses survive during times of diaster, including the pandemic.\n\n\"Once again, the Trump SBA is taking decisive action to deliver accountability in a state whose unaccountable welfare policies have created a culture of fraud and abuse at the expense of law-abiding taxpayers and small business owners,\" Loffler continued.\n\nChildcare Expert Exposes Key Roadblock To Uncovering Potential Fraud Schemes In Minnesota: 'Really Difficult'\n\nThe announcement follows California Attorney General Rob Bonta saying on Thursday that the Trump administration was promoting \"baseless claims\" of persistent fraud in the state.\n\n\"Trump claims California is wasting money when, in reality, our programs are helping lower-income individuals and lower-income families get healthcare, food and housing assistance,\" Bonta said on Thursday.\n\n\"Trump claims, wrongly, California is perpetuating fraud when we are the victim,\" he added.\n\nBonta's office noted that California has recovered nearly $2.7 billion in various fraud schemes across the last 10 years, \"including by partnering with the federal government.\"\n\nExclusive: Senate Bill Targets Minnesota-style ‘Runaway Fraud’ To Force Scammers Repay Taxpayers\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bonta's office on Friday for additional comment.\n\nNewsom's office directed Fox News Digital to the Governor Newsom Press Office X account, which mocked the SBA announcement.\n\n\"OMG. The Trump Administration found MAJOR FRAUD in programs THEY control, Newsom's Press Office's X account posted, linking to a New York Post exclusive on the announcement.\n\n\"The state has no role running / administering these programs.Were they hiding this??? California doesn’t hide fraud … we fight it. Nearly 1,000 arrests + over $125 billion STOPPED under @CAGovernor Gavin Newsom.\"\n\nLoeffler continued that the alleged California fraud comes after the SBA suspended 6,900 borrowers in Minnesota associated with 7,900 potentially fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans, which totaled roughly $400 million.\n\n\"As we did in Minnesota, we are actively working with federal law enforcement to identify the criminals who defrauded American taxpayers, hold them to account, and recoup the stolen funds. As we continue our state-by-state work, our message is clear: pandemic-era fraudsters will not get a pass under this Administration,\" Loeffler said, comparing California to its investigations in Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota became ground zero for welfare and social services fraud surrounding the pandemic late in 2025, when investigators uncovered sweeping fraud schemes that could top $9 billion.\n\nOriginal article",

Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\n“No, I didn’t see that,” Trump replied in video from Forbes Breaking News. “Is that true, is that right?

He was booed at a firefighters’ union conference in Boston in 2024, during Trump’s presidential campaign. He was booed by protesters in Vermont when he traveled there with his family last March for a ski vacation. He was booed by the audience at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., the same month.

    "fullText": "Jeffrey Epstein’s prison cellmate claims to have evidence that the Trump administration wanted the disgraced financier dead and left him unprotected “on purpose,” according to a document obtained by the Daily Beast.\n\nNicholas Tartaglione, a quadruple murderer and former police officer, filed a pardon/commutation petition last summer in which he claimed that Epstein was deliberately exposed to violence in the hope that he would not survive long enough to stand trial.\n\nPrior to Epstein’s death on Aug. 10, 2019, which officials ruled a suicide, jail bosses decided that America’s most high-profile prisoner should share a cell with an accused mass murderer for reasons that have never been explained.\n\nTartaglione had a reputation for extreme violence and a self-confessed hatred of child sex offenders. Tartaglione—who Epstein told prison guards had tried to kill him three weeks before he was found dead—claims “it is no coincidence” that he was “deliberately” moved into the same jail as Epstein and “placed in the same cell” as the convicted child sex offender.\n\nIn a 21-page petition obtained by the Daily Beast, Tartagloine says that he believes the Trump administration wanted Epstein “dead.”\n\nA spokesperson for White House said, “Anyone is able to submit a pardon request—much like everything else the Daily Beast writes, no one should take their garbage seriously. President Trump is the final decider on all clemency and pardon requests.”\n\nTrump, 79, has repeatedly denied any knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities, but has long been haunted by his decades-long association with the uber-wealthy pedophile.\n\nThe well-connected financier was found hanged in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York City, while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking offences.\n\nReferences to the president and his many high-society and political associates identified in the Epstein files would likely have featured heavily during the public hearings.\n\nThe circumstances around Epstein’s death remain controversial, and many in Epstein’s circle—including his brother, Mark, his co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, his former butler, and his legal team—do not believe that he took his own life.\n\nThis week, outspoken podcaster Joe Rogan, once a Trump supporter, also blasted the government for placing Epstein in a cell with Tartaglione. “It’s weird that they took a guy who is one of the most high-profile defendants ever, and you put him in jail with a mass murderer. Kind of crazy,” he said.\n\nReports into Epstein’s death blamed widespread institutional failings, but they were riddled with inconsistencies. A prison psychologist who saw Epstein in the weeks before his death reported that he said suicide was “against his religion” and insisted he was too cowardly to hurt himself because he couldn’t stand pain. Epstein’s lawyer, Reid Weingarten, later told a judge overseeing Epstein’s case: “At or around the time of his death we did not see a despairing or despondent person.”\n\nThe FBI’s observation memo described the image as “possibly an inmate,” while the DOJ inspector general’s review treated it as a corrections officer.\n\nAround three weeks before Epstein died, he was discovered semiconscious in his cell with injuries to his neck. He told guards Tartaglione had attempted to strangle him, before later withdrawing the complaint, saying he couldn’t remember what happened.\n\nTartaglione, who was moved out of Epstein’s cell after that incident, has denied attacking the financier and even claimed that he had tried to save Epstein’s life, having discovered him on the floor with a “piece of string” around his neck.\n\n“I never touched the man,” Tartaglione wrote in a September 2019 letter to the New York Daily News. “I despise anyone who hurts children, but whatever was going to happen to him, I was not going to be a part of it.”\n\nDespite this, Tartaglione admitted in the same letter to the Daily News that he had been a curious choice of cellmate for Epstein. “The staff here at MCC had hundreds of inmates to choose from yet I was their first choice,” Tartaglione wrote.\n\nTartaglione has now written a petition for a pardon to the president.\n\n“It is no coincidence that prior to trial I was transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and deliberately placed in the same cell as Jeffrey Epstein,” he wrote.\n\nHe explained that the bloody and violent nature of his crime was well-known to his prosecutor, Maureen Comey, who was also the lead prosecutor in the Epstein case.\n\nHe claims that there were several attempts made on his own life after he had been unwittingly dragged into the twisted tale of Jeffrey Epstein. “I clearly was not protected on purpose, nor was Epstein. I truly believe that the government wanted both Epstein and me dead,” he wrote.\n\nThe petition also includes obvious attempts to curry favor with the president. He makes accusations against Comey, the daughter of Trump nemesis James Comey, who has since been fired from the DOJ.\n\nHe says she tried to get Epstein to implicate Trump in exchange for his freedom, but also claims that Epstein “told me that President Trump was not involved with Epstein’s crimes.”\n\nThe former police officer also claims he was framed for the kidnapping and murders of four men. He was convicted in 2024 and is serving four consecutive life sentences, meaning he is unlikely ever to be released.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Chabria: Yes, Trump's video showing the Obamas as apes is racist. But it's also about the election",
    "description": "The video posted by Trump depicting the Obamas as apes is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights in the midterm elections.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to Black History Month, 2026 style.\n\nPresident Trump posted a video Thursday to his social media site that contains animated images depicting former President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nThe White House took down the post Friday, and after first calling it nothing more than a meme, they dubbed it a mistake by a staffer. Sure.\n\nBut while the justifiable outrage over this overt racism spins itself into a brief media circus (because we all know something else will come along in about three minutes), let's look a bit deeper into why this video is more than an affront to everything America stands for, or should stand for, anyway.\n\nIt's no accident that the images of the Obamas are embedded deep inside a video about voter fraud conspiracies from the 2020 election (which are untrue, if I need to say it again). This video is an escalation in the assault that is likely to come on voting rights and voting access in the midterms.\n\n\"Absolutely, there's a connection to the vote,\" Melina Abdullah told me Friday. She's a professor at Cal State L.A. and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.\n\n\"This is about more than just about the Obamas,\" added Brian Levin, a professor emeritus at Cal State San Bernardino and founder of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. \"It's about people that are [perceived as] undermining our elections and our democracy.\"\n\nI caught Levin the day after he turned in a chapter about authoritarianism for a new book, which happens to look at how discrimination and the imposition of social hierarchies ties in with power.\n\nLet me summarize. Vulnerable groups are smashed down as dangerous and not fit to be full citizens, so a smaller group of elites can justify power by any means to protect society from these lowly and nasty influences.\n\nLet me make that messaging even simpler: Black and brown people are bad and shouldn't be allowed to participate in democracy because they don't deserve the right.\n\nHow does that play out at the ballot box?\n\nAll that talk about voter identification and election integrity is really about stopping people from voting — people who legally have the right to vote. Those who are least likely to be able to obtain proof of citizenship — which might require a passport or birth certificate, along with the money and know-how to get such documents — are often Black or brown people. They are often also poor, or poorer, and therefore have less time and money to put into obtaining documents, and also live in urban areas where they share polling places.\n\nIs it such a stretch to imagine some kind of federal oversight at those types of polling places, turning away — or simply intimidating away — legal voters who have long made up a strong bloc of the Democratic base?\n\nLet's hope that never happens. But the current undermining of the legitimacy of Black and brown voters is, Levin and Abdullah said, systemic and concerning.\n\nTrump's latest video is \"part of a floodgate of bigotry and conspiracy that relates to elections and immigrants and Black people and it's important to condemn the manner in which these puzzle pieces are put together to label African Americans and immigrants as a threat to democracy with respect to the vote,\" Levin said.\n\nThe premise of the video in question is that Democrats have engaged in a complicated and decades-long scheme to steal elections. It's presented as a documentary, and the images of the Obamas have been weirdly inserted as almost a subliminal flash near the end.\n\nIf you've missed the white supremacist postings that have now become commonplace on official government communications such as those from the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security, let me assure you that Levin is right and this primate video is indeed part of a \"firehose\" of white nationalist rhetoric coming not just from Trump, but from the federal government as a whole.\n\nThe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, for example, has turned its focus toward punishing diversity, equity and inclusion. Just this week, another federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, began a probe against Nike for allegedly discriminating against white people in hiring.\n\n\"It has been not even a dog-whistling, but a Xeroxing of the exact kind of terms that I've been looking at on white supremacists' and neo-Nazi websites for decades,\" Levin said.\n\nIt's not my place or intent to warn Black people about racism, because that would be ludicrous and insulting, but I'll warn the rest of us because in the end, authoritarianism targets everyone. This video is a clear statement that Trump's vision of America is one in which every non-white group, every vulnerable group really, is a second-class citizen.\n\n\"He's enabling an entire group of people who want to take this country back to a time when rampant violent white supremacy was enabled in the law,\" Abdullah said. \"What they mean is recapturing an old-school, oppressive racism that is pre-1965, pre-Voting Rights Act.\"\n\nThat message, Levin said, has \"a resonance with a decent part of his base,\" and when fed ceaselessly into the system, can have violent outcomes.\n\nLevin uses the example of when Trump tweeted during the 2020 protests over the killing of George Floyd: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" a phrase with a violent and racist history.\n\nLevin said Black people have always been the primary targets of hate crimes in the United States, but after that tweet, it was some of the \"worst days\" for violence aimed by race.\n\n\"When a high transmitter, like a president, circulates imagery with regard to prejudice, it creates these stereotypes and conspiracy theories, which then are the groundwork for further conspiracy theories and aggression,\" he added.\n\nAbdullah said she worries that even if the voter crackdown isn't officially sanctioned, those empowered conspiracy theorists will take action anyway.\n\n\"So the people who are so-called monitoring, self-appointed monitors ... this is who's going to be pulling people out of voter lines, and so this is what he's whipping up intentionally,\" she said.\n\nKeep your eye on the ball, folks, because the far-right Republicans running the show are laser-focused on it. The midterm elections have to go their way for them to remain in power.\n\nThe easiest way to ensure that outcome is to only allow voters who see things their way.\n\nGet the L.A.

    "fullText": "Border Patrol really isn’t welcome anywhere!\n\nU.S. Border Patrol may be all about kicking people out of the country, but Commander Gregory Bovino just got the same treatment at a bar in Las Vegas.\n\nJust days after President Donald Trump pulled Bovino out of Minnesota when he started facing backlash for overseeing the administration’s aggressive mass deportation agenda that led to the fatal shooting of Americans Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bovino found out there was another place he wasn’t welcome: a Sin City bar.\n\nBovino was spotted drinking wine at a sports bar on the Las Vegas Strip Bottled Blonde, but he was quickly removed out of concern for the safety of the other bar patrons.\n\n“Upon becoming aware of the individual’s presence, the patron was asked to leave the premises and was escorted out by staff in accordance with venue policy to maintain a safe and orderly environment for all patrons,” the venue told the Daily Beast.\n\nBottled Blonde didn’t elaborate except to explain that, as a private business that “does not engage in political activity or affiliations,” they reserve “the right to refuse service to any patron at its discretion.”\n\nIt’s unclear why Bovino was seen in the Las Vegas bar three days after he was removed from his role as Border Patrol “commander at large” and transferred back to his old position in California, but he was caught on video and in still photos drinking with a group of younger men.\n\nAfter being kicked out of Bottled Blonde he was seen walking down the Strip with those same men. The photos and videos triggered a backlash online, where people were angry that he was enjoying a night out after leading the violent immigration sweep that caused the extrajudicial shooting of two American citizens.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: Border Patrol boss embarrassingly kicked out of a Las Vegas bar to protect patrons\n\nLGBTQ+ officials denounce ICE killing of Minneapolis woman, demand investigation\n\nBorder Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some of his masked agents will leave Minneapolis\n\nJustice Department employee charged & fired after throwing Subway sandwich at federal law enforcement officer",

Many believed he would attend his dad’s alma mater, but he ended up attending New York University, seemingly for business. But what else business-like has Barron done? Well, we know he helped with his dad’s campaign, and now he’s fully stepping into the business role his dad has held.\n\nIn case you missed it, Barron just became a partner in a new beverage company called Sollos Yerba Mate Inc.

Donald has five children in total. He and his first wife, the late Ivana Trump, welcomed three children named Donald Jr, born Dec 1977, Ivanka, born Oct 1981, and Eric, Jan 1984.

    "description": "Melania Trump used to walk red carpets in sparkly, sheer outfits. As first lady, she embraces suits, high-fashion designers, and bold accessories.",
    "fullText": "At a \"Celebrity\" party in 1998, Melania chose a figure-hugging silk dress in periwinkle. Its neckline scooped gently.\n\nMelania arrived at the 1999 Annual Fragrance Foundation Fifi Awards in a form-fitting dress covered entirely in pink sparkles.\n\nThe gown's subtle slit was sexy without being over the top.\n\nShe attended the New York premiere of \"Charlie's Angels\" in a white skirt suit, but added a daring edge to the look with a sheer lace top.\n\nStrappy heels completed her outfit.\n\nWhen she accompanied Donald Trump to the Oscars, Melania wore a form-fitting white dress embellished with sparkly sequins.\n\nThe gown had a V-neckline, which mirrored the slit running up the center of the dress.\n\nBefore her life had political ties, Melania was often spotted in casual looks, like this all-orange ensemble she wore to a Fashion Week show.\n\nShe paired the silk off-the-shoulder top with wide-legged pants that featured a striped pattern and sparkles.\n\nA full skirt accented the gown's form-fitting bodice.\n\nThe black-and-tan dress had a feathered skirt with sheer detailing, and she paired it with coordinating shoes.\n\nTrump proposed to Melania on April 26, 2004, the evening of the Met Gala.\n\nShe paired her 15-carat engagement ring with a black ball gown, which had a corset covered in cutouts.\n\nAttending a Fashion Week event, Melania paired fitted jeans with a sheer pink babydoll top. High heels completed the look.\n\nMelania attended the Night of Stars party in October 2005 when she was expecting Barron Trump.\n\nShe wore an empire-waist black gown to the event, which featured sheer fabric on the neckline and sparkly embellishments.\n\nBlack dresses with sheer detailing became a bit of a uniform for Melania in the early 2000s, as she showed with her dress for the Metropolitan Opera Opening Night Dinner in 2006.\n\nThe silk dress had lace detailing on the sheer bodice and the neckline. Crisscross straps and lace paneling on the skirt added to the sexy gown.\n\nAt the 2007 Met Gala, Melania wore a shiny gold minidress with fabric tassels that swayed as she walked. She paired the look with coordinating gold shoes.\n\nMelania was photographed attending a Fashion Week event in 2007 alongside Donald Trump.\n\nShe wore all-black, and her hat and wrap featured fuzzy detailing. Knee-high boots completed the wintry ensemble.\n\nMelania kept up her streak of eye-catching Met Gala looks in 2008, arriving in a bright-pink, strapless Vera Wang dress.\n\nThe dress had a bow on the neckline and ruffle detailing on its mermaid skirt.\n\nAt the premiere of \"Nine,\" Melania wore a short, long-sleeved dress embroidered with sparkles, which she paired with pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black cocktail dress had a form-fitting bodice with a subtle sweetheart neckline and spaghetti straps. The dress hit her knees, and she paired it with open-toe shoes.\n\nMelania's black suit was simple, featuring flared pants and a fitted jacket. The top buttons of her white blouse were open, and the sleeves poked out from under the jacket.\n\nBlack, pointed heels complemented the ensemble.\n\nMelania's gray dress for her \"Good Afternoon America\" appearance had a professional feel.\n\nThe fitted dress had a V-neckline and covered her knees, and a black belt cinched her waist. She also wore black heels.\n\nWhen Trump hosted an Invitational Grand Prix at Mar-a-Lago in January 2013, Melania showed that she could nail a dress code.\n\nHer white, sleeveless dress had a scooped neckline and a pleated skirt that felt like an elevated version of a golf ensemble. She added white heels to the look.\n\nThe jumpsuit featured long sleeves, subtly flared pants, and semi-sheer paneling on the bodice adorned with black lace.\n\nBlack heels accented the ensemble.\n\nAfter Trump announced he was running for president in the summer of 2015, he and Melania appeared on \"Barbara Walters Presents: The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2015.\"\n\nMelania chose a simple pink dress with short sleeves and a modest neckline for the interview. Her pink, pointed shoes matched the dress.\n\nLauren A. Rothman, a style strategist and image coach, told Business Insider that Melania seemed to be telling \"two narratives\" with fashion throughout her life, leaning into glamour and slightly more daring looks when she was first in the public eye.\n\nBut after Trump entered politics, Rothman said Melania's looks became more intentional because \"she was trying to say something with more storytelling\" about her identity and her husband through her fashion, as she showed at the 2016 RNC.\n\nFor the RNC, Melania wore the \"Margot\" dress from Roksanda, which she bought from Net-a-Porter, according to Vanity Fair. The modest white dress had a high neckline, a knee-length hem, and quarter-length sleeves that ended in ruffles.\n\nThe dress was simple and elegant, striking a similar tone to first ladies of years past.\n\nMelania attended her husband's inauguration in a powder-blue dress designed by Ralph Lauren Collection. The dress was paired with a matching shrug and gloves.\n\nThe silhouette was reminiscent of Jackie Kennedy's outfits during her time as first lady.\n\n\"It was so curated,\" Rothman said of the look. \"It was an instant revival of that Jackie memory.\"\n\nRothman said the nostalgia in the look lent Melania some of the power Jackie Kennedy held in the American mind, striking the right tone for the beginning of her tenure as first lady.\n\nRalph Lauren is also a classic American designer, though Melania would go on to wear European designers throughout Trump's presidency.\n\nMelania changed into a gown custom-designed by Hervé Pierre Braillard for his Hervé Pierre line.\n\nThe form-fitting, cream dress had off-the-shoulder sleeves made of the same fabric as a three-dimensional swath that cut across the bodice, creating volume. The same fabric flowed on the skirt, creating a train on one side, and a red belt cinched her waist.\n\nBraillard became Melania's stylist and strategy consultant throughout Trump's first term.\n\nIn 2018, Melania visited the Texas-Mexico border to speak to child migrants wearing a green jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nThe Zara jacket instantly became controversial, leading people to speculate that the first lady was sending a message to the president or migrants at the border.\n\nIn her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now,\" Stephanie Grisham, Melania's former aide, wrote that Trump yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though he later told media outlets she wore it to send a message to \"fake news\" outlets. Melania later repeated Trump's comments on the jacket, CNN reported.\n\nMelania accompanied Trump to the debate in a pinstripe Dolce & Gabbana suit.\n\nShe wore the jacket open over a white blouse with no tie and completed her look with Christian Louboutin heels.\n\nWhen the Trumps left the White House on January 20, 2021, Melania wore an all-black outfit comprising a Chanel jacket with gold button detailing, a Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Christian Louboutin heels. Black gloves and sunglasses completed the somber but chic ensemble.\n\nBut when they arrived at Mar-a-Lago later that day, Melania exited Air Force One in a $3,700 Gucci dress, though she wore the same sunglasses she had on earlier that day. Her loose gown featured quarter-length sleeves and an orange-and-navy print.\n\n\"Like anyone, sometimes we take off our work clothes, and we put on our play clothes,\" Rothman said. \"She went from wearing something super fitted to something loose that is right out of Palm Beach.\"\n\nMelania kept her public appearances more limited after Trump left office, but she appeared alongside him at a New Year's Eve party at Mar-a-Lago in December 2022.\n\nFor the occasion, she wore another Dolce & Gabbana dress. The knee-length, silver gown had long sleeves. It was covered in sparkles, as were her pointed-toe shoes.\n\nMelania paired a black long-sleeved top with a high-waisted, midi-length brown skirt from Martin Grant, which was belted with a bow at her waist. Her Chanel ballet flats featured both colors.\n\nA black Chanel bag completed her look.\n\nMelania stepped out at Mar-a-Lago in a black Versace dress for the last day of 2024.\n\nThe gown had an asymmetrical neckline that scooped low, hugged Melania's figure, then formed a slit on one leg.\n\nIt was glamorous and more reminiscent of her looks before Trump entered politics.\n\nMelania arrived at the 2025 inauguration in a custom navy coat designed by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket was elegant, and Melania paired it with navy pumps and a white scarf. However, the standout element of her look was her Eric Javits hat, which was also navy and white.\n\n\"It's a huge fashion moment,\" Rothman said of Melania's hat. She said the summery shape of the hat nodded to Melania's day-to-day life at Mar-a-Lago, while the wool texture and dark colors spoke to the role she was stepping back into.\n\n\"She wore a hat that bridges her worlds together,\" she added.\n\nMelania again turned to Hervé Pierre for her evening look at Donald Trump's inaugural balls, donning a strapless white dress. Black fabric crisscrossed the bodice and skirt, creating a slit on one side.\n\nA black choker made of the same fabric tied the look together.\n\nThe first lady wore a slew of menswear looks in early 2025, including a Ralph Lauren suit she wore to support the Take It Down Act at the US Capitol in March 2025.\n\nThe camel-toned, three-piece suit included a jacket, fitted trousers, and a vest. She paired it with a white blouse, black tie, and coordinating pumps, giving the look a distinctly formal feel.\n\nIn September 2025, Melania joined her husband on a state visit to the UK, spending time with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales.\n\nFor a white-tie dinner at Windsor Castle, Melania wore a bright-yellow gown designed by Carolina Herrera. The off-the-shoulder dress had long sleeves and a floor-length skirt, and it cinched at Melania's waist with a wide purple belt.\n\nThe gown's bright color was a bold choice for the royal dinner and a marked change from the neutral looks Melania had been wearing for much of 2025.\n\nThe Trumps hosted Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for dinner at the White House in November 2025.\n\nThe first lady wore a strapless, green gown for the dinner. Designed by Elie Saab, the $3,350 dress featured ruching on the bodice and skirt, with a slit running up the center.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but it also radiated a warm welcome for Salman, as the deep-green fabric resembled the colors of the Saudi flag. Likewise, Elie Saab held a historic fashion show in Saudi Arabia in 2024, so the choice of designer seemed to nod to Salman's country as well.\n\nWhen the 2025 Christmas tree arrived at the White House, Melania donned a knee-length white coat. The high-neck, wide-sleeved coat was typical for the first lady, but her accessories were more colorful than she might have worn in years past.\n\nShe wore red leather gloves from Max Mara, which brought drama to the look, as well as tartan pumps from Manolo Blahnik. The look was festive but still felt authentic to Melania's style.\n\nAt the start of 2026, the first lady returned to her more neutral-toned wardrobe in a Dolce & Gabbana look while promoting \"Melania.\"\n\nHer high-neck suit jacket was buttoned down the center and belted at the waist. Her midi-length skirt was column-style, and she paired the set with black pumps.\n\nThe outfit struck a professional, restrained tone, particularly compared to the colorful looks she wore in the second half of 2025.",

    "fullText": "UPDATED: While Democrats have condemned Donald Trump’s Truth Social post of a video featuring a racist AI depiction of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes, one of the president’s strident defenders also called it out.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who is chairing the GOP’s Senate campaign efforts this year, wrote on X, “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it.”\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nDonald Trump Now Says He “Shouldn’t Be Involved” In DOJ Review Of A Netflix Or Paramount Acquisition Of Warner Bros.\n\nHoda Kotb Returns To 'Today' To Highlight Show Of Support For Savannah Guthrie And Family After Disappearance Of Their Mother Nancy\n\nPraying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it. https://t.co/gADoM13ssZ\n\n— Tim Scott (@votetimscott) February 6, 2026\n\nA couple hours after Scott’s statement, the Trump post was taken down, with a White House official saying, “A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.”\n\nEarlier on Friday morning, the White House acknowledged that Trump posted the video, and defended the president for doing so. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, “This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King. Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.”\n\nLeavitt’s comments were a contrast to an incident in Trump’s first term, when Roseanne Barr, then starring in her own ABC sitcom, referred to Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to the Obamas, as the offspring to the “planet of the apes.” The Walt Disney Co. fired Barr. At the time, then-White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called out what she saw as a media double standard, but told reporters that “no one is defending” the sitcom star’s comments.\n\nAnother Republican, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY), who faces a competitive reelection race this cycle, wrote, “The President’s post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Obamas did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe NAACP said in a statement, “Trump posting this video — especially during Black History Month— is a stark reminder of how Trump and his followers truly view people. And we’ll remember that in November.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement, “President Obama and Michelle Obama are brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans. They represent the best of this country. Donald Trump is a vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder. Why are GOP leaders like John Thune continuing to stand by this sick individual? Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump’s disgusting bigotry.”\n\nMSNBC and CNN covered the post during morning programming on Friday, while Fox News largely ignored it.\n\nThe clip of the Obamas features an “@XERIAS_X” watermark, and it appears that the account originally posted the video in October last year. The 55-second video portrays Trump as a lion, while Hillary Clinton and Zohran Mamdani are depicted as a warthog and hyena respectively.\n\nThe @XERIAS_X account has a profile photo of Pepe the Frog dressed as Trump. The account claimed credit for the “fighter jet poop” AI video posted by Trump during the “No Kings” protests last year.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

There, they complained of the negative public perception of the agencies, long working hours and “incompetent” leadership, according to the outlet.\n\nThe outlet noted that users on the forum do not need to prove their employment to join and it had not confirmed the identities of the people posting.\n\nUsers were candid about the public perception of the agencies amid the Trump administration’s immigration surge in cities across the U.S.\n\n“I'm all for removing illegals, but snatching dudes off lawn mowers in Cali and leaving the truck and equipment just sitting there? Definitely not working smarter,” said one user in a post viewed by WIRED.\n\nPosts in the forum reportedly amped up following public scrutiny and outrage of the agencies in Minnesota, where U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nOne user started a thread titled, “Ready to resign, had enough stress” five days before Pretti was killed. “I have 2.3 years left for full special category retirement … but don't know if I'll make it. Tired of this Agency. Employees being abused badly,” the user reportedly wrote.\n\nThe user also complained of agents being deployed for temporary duty at short notice in cities where the administration is carrying out large-scale immigration operations.\n\n“No more weekends off, more work than ever before in 18 years. No more union. No more down time,” the post reportedly continued. “This is not what any of us envisioned for our last years of career when we are in our 50's.”\n\nOther users lashed out at Homeland Security leadership.\n\n“Led by some of the worst leadership I’ve ever witnessed, from the local level all the way up to the national stage, this agency has managed to turn a righteous mission into a complete clown show,” another user reportedly wrote.\n\n“This is going to be a train wreck that we may not survive,” another reportedly said.\n\nThe Independent had contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nReports of “plummeting” morale among federal law enforcement officers tasked with carrying out the administration’s immigration operations have been widespread since the unrest in Minneapolis. In a report at the end of January, more than 20 current and former immigration officials told The New York Times of their discontent in the hours following the fatal shooting of Pretti.\n\nCurrent and former ICE officials who spoke with the outlet anonymously said they were “unhappy with the sharp rhetoric” coming from top White House and Homeland Security officials, who were quick to blame Pretti.\n\nOne ICE agent told the Times that he had “always given the benefit of the doubt to the government in these situations,” but that he now no longer believed “any of the statements they put out anymore.”\n\n“We lost all trust,” a current ICE official added. “I’m not sure I can see how we exist three years from now.”\n\nFox News correspondent Bill Melugin also reported “extreme frustration” in the department over “some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed in the aftermath of the shooting.”\n\n“These sources say this messaging from DHS officials has been catastrophic from a PR and morale perspective, as it is eroding trust and credibility,” Melugin reported Sunday.\n\nIn response, Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said ICE and border patrol agents “get up every morning to try and make our communities safer.”\n\n“The men and women of ICE and Border Patrol are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters,” McLaughlin said in a previous statement to The Independent. “Like everyone else, our officers just want to go home to our families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer last month that he was finally prepared to drop his freeze on billions of dollars in funding for a major New York infrastructure project.\n\nBut there was a condition: In exchange for the money, Schumer had to agree to rename New York’s Penn Station and Washington’s Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe startling offer, which was described by two people familiar with the conversation, was swiftly rejected by Schumer, who told the president he didn’t have the power to deliver on such an unorthodox request.\n\nIn the weeks since, Trump has continued to withhold the more than $16 billion earmarked for the long-planned Gateway project connecting New York and New Jersey through a new rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River.\n\nThe two states are now suing the Trump administration over the freeze, alleging in a complaint filed earlier this week that the funding suspension is unlawful.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe episode, first reported by Punchbowl, offers a fresh window into Trump’s ever-expanding effort to secure an outsized place in American history — and to do so in part by branding nearly everything around him with his own name.\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has introduced a slew of initiatives bearing the Trump name, including the Trump Gold Card offering a high-priced path to citizenship, the TrumpRx website offering lower-priced prescription drugs, and a new Trump-class battleship meant to solidify his era of “peace through strength” foreign policy for years to come.\n\nTrump in recent months has set his sights on even bigger targets: Adding his name first to the US Institute of Peace and then, even more controversially, to Washington’s iconic Kennedy Center.\n\nStill, Trump’s offer to Schumer would have represented perhaps his most audacious move yet, an apparent attempt to leverage the future of a massive infrastructure project to fulfill his own personal wishes.\n\nThe commission in charge of the Gateway tunnel has warned that it will soon have to shut down work on the project and lay off roughly 1,000 workers if the Trump administration does not release the funding it needs.\n\nThe tunnel’s construction predates Trump’s return to office, with the federal government on the hook for a significant portion of the funding needed to complete it. But Trump moved to halt the project late last year, a decision that Democratic officials in New Jersey and New York have argued was politically motivated.\n\nSchumer has since played a central role in trying to negotiate the unfreezing of the funding. Yet despite that priority, there’s little that the Democrat could conceivably do on his own to put Trump’s name on either Penn Station or Dulles Airport.\n\nWhile some conservative lawmakers have already introduced legislation to rename Dulles as the “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” it’s so far gained little traction.\n\nThe legislation has not advanced in the GOP-controlled Congress, and as a result remains unlikely to pass.",

    "description": "At the National Prayer Breakfast, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) called on the president to “be invested in the alleviation of suffering” across America.",
    "fullText": "With President Donald Trump standing awkwardly behind him, a Democratic congressman used his prayer at the National Prayer Breakfast to urge Trump to “think of families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nSpeaking at the bipartisan Washington, D.C., event on Thursday shortly after Trump gave a rambling address, Rep. Jonathan Jackson (D-Ill.) offered a prayer for “the future of this nation,” and asked God to “lead this president into greater levels of compassion.”\n\nNews: Minneapolis Mayor Shreds ‘Thoughts And Prayers’ Over School Shooting: Kids ‘Were Literally Praying’\n\nJackson, the son of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, said, “Today, we remind him that the lives of millions of people are in his hands, and that he has the power to turn mourning into dancing or to reduce the country into a cosmic elegy of chaos and suffering.”\n\nJackson continued by calling on Trump to be “mindful of the poor” and “be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening on farms in the Midwest, in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.”\n\nHe added that “we are all Americans, all made in the image of God, and that none of us are free unless all of us have our freedoms protected.” (Watch video at the end of the story.)\n\nWhen the prayer finished, Trump shook Jackson’s hand and appeared to say, “Great words.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nDuring his address, the Republican president said he didn’t know “how a person of faith can vote for a Democrat.”\n\nThe plea to Trump came amid weeks of chaos in Minnesota as a result of his administration’s immigration crackdown, with the president’s rhetoric helping to sow discord.\n\nPolitics: Hillary Clinton Pulls No Punches In Fiery Response To GOP Congressman\n\nThe president has baselessly accused the state of harboring thousands of violent undocumented immigrants, calling them the “worst of the worst.”\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protests against the influx, federal agents have shot dead two U.S. citizens ― 37-year-old Renee Good and Alex Pretti, also 37 ― in separate incidents.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it is scaling back immigration operations around Minnesota by withdrawing about 700 of the roughly 3,000 federal officers sent to the state.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News later that day, Trump admitted he could have adopted “a little bit of a softer touch” in the region.\n\nwow -- with Trump standing behind him, a man (not sure who he is) offers this prayer: \"We pray that he would be mindful of the poor and that he would be invested in the alleviation of suffering happening in the families preparing to bury their loved ones in Minneapolis.\" pic.twitter.com/toJk9vIboF\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter Setting Minneapolis Ablaze, Trump Now Appears Interested In Dampening The Flames\n\nJD Vance Won't Apologize For Amplifying Smears Against Alex Pretti\n\nTrump's Border Czar Announces 700 Immigration Officers To Immediately Leave Minnesota",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump dropped a whopper of a dodge when NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Llamas asked him if he would testify to Congress about the Epstein files like former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to do.\n\nLlamas scored a big exclusive interview with Trump that’s set to air on Super Bowl Sunday, with clips rolling out in advance.\n\nIn an extended preview that aired on Tuesday night’s edition of NBC News Now’s Top Story with Tom Llamas, the subject of the Epstein files came up only once, when Trump brought it up in relation to the Clintons.\n\nWhen Llamas cut in to ask if he would follow their lead, Trump claimed “they’ve already brought me”:\n\nTOM LLAMAS: We didn’t get a chance to speak about the DOJ. I appreciate all your time and of your staff’s time. They’ve been very, very kind.\n\nShould anybody else expect the DO J to kind of come after them like you’ve come over after some of your political enemies?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we remember this tale. I was impeached twice, two fake impeachments, won both of them easily.\n\nRepublicans stood by me 100 percent, but I won both them. I was indicted 87 different times, and then you ask me that question.\n\nI think I’m extremely moderate, especially for what they did to me. They wanted to take me down. I said to somebody, do me a favor, add up the counts. If I lost, you know, I won.\n\nBut if I lost these cases, add the counts and tell me, how long would I have to serve in prison? You know what they came up with? 287 years. I said, I’d better win.\n\nTOM LLAMAS: In your mind that calculation means it’s okay for the DOJ to go after your political enemies?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I could be involved. You know, I’m the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. I could involved, but I’m not. I don’t choose to.\n\nBut when they say to me, oh, you’re going after people, I got indicted all of those times. It’s 287 years in jail.\n\nThey were willing to put, you know, they asked me a question yesterday at the press conference about Clinton because of the testimony. The Epstein thing, which turned out that I have nothing to do, and they did, about Epstein.\n\nAnd they said, do you think it’s terrible what, you know, with the subpoenas and everything, and they’re disobeying the subpoenas.\n\nAnd I actually said, it’s a shame. You have an ex-president, and you have, you now, the president’s wife and secretary of state. And I said, It’s a shame. It is a shame,\n\nTOM LLAMAS: NBC News broke the story today. I don’t know if you saw it, that the Democrats are already saying, if you bring President Bill Clinton, and he has to testify, we’re bringing President Trump. What do you say to that?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I think they might say that, you know. But they’ve already brought me. See, I’ve been brought. They had me indicted many, many times. Many, many, times. They didn’t do that to Clinton.\n\nPresident Trump once faced criminal trials in Washington D.C., Georgia, New York, and Florida on a total of 91 felony counts — none of which involved Jeffrey Epstein, and none of which resulted in his testimony under oath.\n\nTrump did testify at the E. Jean Carroll civil trial, but was not asked about Epstein.\n\nHe didn’t win all of the criminal cases — Trump was found “guilty” on all 34 felony counts in the Stormy Daniels hush money-election interference trial. He was eventually sentenced to an unconditional discharge on January 10, 2025 after his election victory.\n\nAnd Republicans were not with him “one-hundred percent” in his impeachment trials. Seven GOP senators joined Democrats in voting to convict in his second impeachment trial, and then-Sen. Mitt Romney (R-MI) voted to convict in the first.\n\nWatch above via NBC News Now’s Top Story with Tom Llamas.\n\nThe post Trump Drops Whopper of a Claim When NBC Anchor Asks if He’ll Testify on Epstein Files in Blockbuster Interview first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan is refusing to voluntarily comply with a Justice Department investigation into a video she organized urging U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders” — escalating a dispute that President Donald Trump has publicly pushed.\n\nIn letters first obtained by The Associated Press, Slotkin’s lawyer informed U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro that the senator would not agree to a voluntary interview about the video. Slotkin's legal team also requested that Pirro preserve all documents related to the matter for “anticipated litigation.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer separately wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi, declining to sit for an FBI interview about the video and urging her to immediately terminate any inquiry.\n\nThe refusal marks a potential turning point in the standoff, shifting the burden onto the Justice Department to decide whether it will escalate an investigation into sitting members of Congress or retreat from an inquiry now being openly challenged.\n\n“I did this to go on offense,” Slotkin said in an interview Wednesday. “And to put them in a position where they’re tap dancing. To put them in a position where they have to own their choices of using a U.S. attorney’s office to come after a senator.”\n\n‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back'\n\nLast November, Slotkin joined five other Democratic lawmakers — all of whom previously served in the military or at intelligence agencies — in posting a 90-second video urging U.S. service members to follow established military protocols and reject orders they believe to be unlawful.\n\nThe lawmakers said Trump's Republican administration was “pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens” and called on troops to “stand up for our laws.”\n\nThe video sparked a firestorm in Republican circles and soon drew the attention of Trump, who accused the lawmakers of sedition and said their actions were “punishable by death.”\n\nThe Pentagon later announced it had opened an investigation into Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot who appeared in the video. The FBI then contacted the lawmakers seeking interviews, signaling a broader Justice Department inquiry.\n\nSlotkin said multiple legal advisers initially urged caution.\n\n“Maybe if you keep quiet, this will all go away over Christmas,” Slotkin said she was told.\n\nBut in January, the matter flared again, with the lawmakers saying they were contacted by the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia.\n\nMeanwhile, security threats mounted. Slotkin said her farm in Michigan received a bomb threat, her brother was assigned a police detail due to threats and her parents were swatted in the middle of the night.\n\nHer father, who died in January after a long battle with cancer, “could barely walk and he’s dealing with the cops in his home,” she said.\n\nSlotkin said a “switch went off” in her and she became angry: “And I said, ‘It’s not gonna stop unless I fight back.’”\n\nDemocratic senators draw a line\n\nThe requests from the FBI and the Justice Department have been voluntary. Slotkin said that her legal team had communicated with prosecutors but that officials “keep asking for a personal interview.”\n\nSlotkin’s lawyer, Preet Bharara, in the letter to Pirro declined the interview request and asked that she “immediately terminate any open investigation and cease any further inquiry concerning the video.” In the other letter, Bharara urged Bondi to use her authority to direct Pirro to close the inquiry.\n\nBharara wrote that Slotkin’s constitutional rights had been infringed and said litigation is being considered.\n\n“All options are most definitely on the table,” Slotkin said. Asked whether she would comply with a subpoena, she paused before responding: “I’d take a hard look at it.”\n\nBharara, who's representing Slotkin in the case, is a former U.S. attorney in New York who was fired by Trump in 2017 during his first administration. He's also representing Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California in a separate case involving the Justice Department.\n\nKelly has similarly pushed back, suing the Pentagon last month over attempts to punish him for the video. On Tuesday, a federal judge said that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon’s censuring of Kelly as he weighed whether to intervene.\n\nSlotkin said she's in contact with the other lawmakers who appeared in the video, but she wouldn't say what their plans were in the investigations.\n\nTrump has frequently and consistently targeted his political opponents. In some cases, those attacks have had the unintended consequence of elevating their national standing.\n\nIn Kelly’s case, he raised more than $12.5 million in the final months of 2025 following the “illegal orders” video controversy, according to campaign finance filings.\n\nSlotkin, like Kelly, has been mentioned among Democrats who could emerge as presidential contenders in 2028.\n\nShe previously represented one of the nation’s most competitive House districts before winning a Senate seat in Michigan in 2024, even as Trump carried the state.\n\nSlotkin delivered the Democratic response to Trump’s address to Congress last year and has since urged her party to confront him more aggressively, saying Democrats had lost their “alpha energy” and calling on them to “go nuclear” against Trump’s redistricting push.\n\n“If I’m encouraging other people to take risk, how can I not then accept risk myself?\" Slotkin said. “I think you’ve got to show people that we’re not going to lay down and take it.”",

    "fullText": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he does not support President Trump’s proposal for Republicans to “take over” voting procedures in more than a dozen states and “nationalize” the midterm elections, declaring the president’s call to action blatantly unconstitutional.\n\n“That’s not what the Constitution says about elections,” Paul said in an interview Tuesday with MS NOW’s Stephanie Ruhle, when asked about the president’s statement that Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting.”\n\nPaul noted the U.S. Supreme Court limits states in some ways, such as by barring them from setting different rules for some issues, including term limits. But he said the Constitution gives states the power to determine the time, place and matter of elections.\n\n“The Supreme Court did rule that, for example, Washington state can’t set term limits on federal officials if Georgia doesn’t. It has to be a uniform election law,” the Kentucky Republican said.\n\n“But as far as the time, place and manner of elections, that, under the Constitution, is a state activity,” he continued. “So, I’m not for nationalizing it.”\n\nPaul added that Democrats tried to implement sweeping national election reforms when former President Biden was in office, but that Republicans blocked in in the Senate.\n\n“I was against Nancy Pelosi’s bill, which would have nationalized it, but I would also be against any bill coming from this administration that would nationalize elections,” he said, referring to the Democratic former Speaker from California.\n\nTrump doubled down on his call for the GOP to “nationalize” voting Tuesday, despite efforts by the White House to soften his previous statements on the issue. He said the federal government should take a more active role in running elections to combat what he called “corruption.”\n\n“Look at some of the places — that horrible corruption on elections — and the federal government should not allow that,” the president said. “The federal government should get involved.”\n\nThose comments followed a statement he made to conservative commentator and former Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino in a podcast that aired Monday, in which he said Republicans should “take over” elections.\n\n“The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over,’” he said. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.”\n\nThose statements received pushback from several high-profile Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nThune told reporters that voters should be required to show identification to prove they are citizens but he does not support the federal government seizing the power to run elections.\n\n“I’m supportive of only citizens voting and showing ID at polling places,” he said. “I think that makes sense. … But I’m not favor of federalizing elections, no. I think that’s a constitutional issue.”\n\n“I’m a big believer in decentralized and distributed power,” the senator added. “And I think it’s harder to hack 50 election systems than it is to hack one. In my view, at least, that’s always a system that has worked pretty well.”",

    "fullText": "A federal judge was skeptical of President Donald Trump’s argument to try to move the appeal of his hush money conviction to federal court — after lawyers already took their shot in two other courts.\n\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein suggested Trump’s attorneys missed their chance by first taking the US Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity to the state court judge who oversaw the criminal trial and not to a federal judge until almost two months later.\n\n“You made a choice. You sought two bites at the apple,” Hellerstein told Trump’s lawyers Wednesday.\n\nHe also quizzed Trump’s lawyer over the argument that the case should move to federal court because Trump could claim as a defense that he has immunity. Calling the arguments “provocative,” he said he would issue a ruling later.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are trying to get the appeal of his hush money conviction moved into federal court where the judges could interpret challenges involving federal preemption and presidential immunity. Removal would also plow a quicker path to have the appeal heard by the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump was convicted in 2024 of 34 state charges of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDuring oral arguments on Wednesday, Hellerstein said Trump’s attorneys appeared to make a strategic decision to bring the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity first to Judge Juan Merchan, the state judge who oversaw the trial, before trying to move the case to federal court which it did 58 days after the decision came down.\n\nJeffrey Wall, an attorney for Trump, pushed back against Hellerstein’s comment that he was trying to get another bite at the apple.\n\n“It would have been disrespectful in spades” to Judge Merchan if they bypassed him, Wall said. He said they had to move quickly before the state judge because Trump was set to be sentenced by him 10 days later.\n\nHellerstein said Trump’s attorneys missed the 30-day window allowed under the statute to move the case into federal court and their burden now was whether there was “good cause” to allow them to try again.\n\n“All your doing is saying your good cause is you’re afraid to anger the state court and you want to give the state court the first chance” to rule on the Supreme Court decision before trying the argument in federal court, the judge said.\n\n“You’ve made a strategic decision. You’re seeing where you can get a better decision and that is indicative of the intent,” the judge said.\n\n“My thesis is that was fatal to you,” Hellerstein said.\n\nTrump is simultaneously appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to influence the 2016 presidential election in state court. That appeal can ultimately be brought to the US Supreme Court but it has additional layers of review.\n\nHellerstein had previously rejected Trump’s effort to move the case into federal court, finding the argument that Trump had presidential immunity didn’t apply. Trump later tried again after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. He argued the use of evidence, including testimony from Trump’s former White House advisor Hope Hicks and his tweets while in office, were improperly used and his conviction should be overturned.\n\nAt the time Hellerstein denied that motion for removal, writing, “Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts.”\n\nTrump appealed and in November the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sent it back to Hellerstein to conduct further analysis considering the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall, the attorney for Trump, argued when the Manhattan district attorney’s office introduced evidence of what they argued were official acts — such as Trump’s tweets, trial testimony from his former White House aide Hope Hicks, and testimony about conversations Trump had with his attorney general — it changed the case and now it should be moved into federal court.\n\n“The district attorney held those keys in his hand. He didn’t have to introduce that evidence at trial to prove up his case. Once he did this became a prosecution relating to those official acts,” Wall argued.\n\n“Is that enough to make it a federal case? I think the answer to that is obviously yes,” Wall said.\n\nThe attorney added, “I don’t think you have to get to the bottom of this. It’s all for the Second Circuit.”\n\nWall said that the judge doesn’t have to decide the merits of the argument on immunity, only that they have what is called a “colorable defense” to move the case into federal court.\n\nSteven Wu, an attorney for the district attorney’s office, argued that a fight over evidence is not a defense to criminal charges.\n\n“The defendant seems to assume that because evidence of official acts is introduced that somehow transforms the nature of the criminal action. That’s just not true. The charges arise out of conduct that is wholly unofficial and private,” Wu said.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s argument, while the judge was skeptical of many of Trump’s legal arguments, he acknowledged a technical maneuver that appealed to him.\n\n“That’s a delicious thought because I then dump the whole problem on the Court of Appeals,” Hellerstein said.",

    "description": "Joan...",
    "fullText": "This is one of many signs that Trump knows his party is in big trouble in the coming midterm elections.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s seizure of Fulton County, Georgia, 2020 voting records remains a chilling, bewildering exercise in using federal agencies to try to validate Donald Trump’s false claim that he won reelection that year, carrying Georgia though even state GOP officials certified that he lost the state by more than 11,000 votes. Trump followed up the FBI raid by insisting, during a podcast interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino, that “Republicans” should “take over” voting procedures in 15 states. “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over,’” he said. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 states. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” Any attempt to “nationalize” voting processes would be unconstitutional; it’s clearly the purview of the states. But note that Trump specifically said one party, his own, should take over. That’s just about as fascist as he’s ever sounded.\n\nWhile spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tried to claim that Trump was only referring to the SAVE Act, which would force Americans to prove their citizenship to register to vote, the president himself continued to insist he intended much more than that. Standing in front of a cadre of Republican lawmakers assembled as he signed legislation ending a brief government shutdown, he announced, “I want to see elections be honest, and if a state can’t run an election, I think the people behind me should do something about it.”\n\nThis is one of many signs that Trump knows his party is in big trouble in the coming midterm elections. Remarkably, many GOP leaders said they disagreed with Trump’s suggestion that Republicans take over elections. “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections,” Senate majority leader John Thune told reporters. “That’s not what the Constitution says about elections,” Senator Rand Paul told MS Now.\n\nWhile Trump lackey House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed doubt that his party could take over elections, he did echo the president’s continued false claims about Democratic voter fraud. “We had three House Republican candidates who were ahead on Election Day in the last election cycle, and every time a new tranche of ballots came in they just magically whittled away until their leads were lost,” Johnson told reporters. “It looks on its face to be fraudulent. Can I prove that? No.”\n\nThat’s right, Mike. You can’t prove it, because it isn’t true.\n\nStill, there’s no doubt Trump is so worried about the midterms that he is looking for ways to manipulate the process (rather than abandon the cruel policies that are making Republicans so unpopular). Trump has suggested cancelling the midterms altogether. He has proposed banning mail-in voting entirely, and decertifying voting equipment he doesn’t trust, believing a smaller, more constrained electorate will skew Republican. The administration has sued states, including Minnesota, to get access to voter rolls. Just yesterday, Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast, “We‘re gonna have ICE surround the polls.… We’ll never again allow an election to be stolen.”\n\nSteve Bannon: “We‘re gonna have ICE surround the polls…We’ll never again allow an election to be stolen.” pic.twitter.com/9R9tZdolHx\n\nTrump has also looked for ways to take custody of ballots and voting records away from local election officials. Democracy Docket founder and voting rights attorney Mark Elias believes last week’s seizure of Fulton County ballots “was in part a dry run to work out the logistics of how this could happen in the future.”\n\nWe still don’t know exactly what led to the Georgia ballot seizure, or why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was part of it (she seems to have been quietly sidelined from genuine intelligence concerns). There are reports that a grand jury is investigating the Fulton County election process, and Trump predicted in Davos, “People will soon be prosecuted for what they did.” Even stranger was the news that Trump talked to Gabbard after the raid, and used her phone to address the agents who carried out the seizure and thank them for their work.\n\nOn one level, the Fulton County exercise may be meaningless, because the 2020 results were certified and President Joe Biden served his term. But if the Department of Justice can find a basis (however flimsy) to seize ballots five years later, it’s not clear what would stop them from seizing ballots immediately after an election. Elias says the strange show of force in Georgia should make Democrats take Trump “seriously and literally” about his plans to impede voting in upcoming elections. CNN reports that Democratic election officials are planning for potential federal interference in the midterms, including the use of ICE and other agencies to intimidate voters.\n\nOn the other hand, some people (including me, occasionally) worry that overstating the threat of GOP interference could lead some Democrats, especially alienated, infrequent voters, to throw up their hands and assume the fix is in. Discouraging Democratic voters is very much part of the GOP’s voter suppression playbook. But Trump’s increasingly bold, shrill comments about making sure the GOP wins upcoming elections serve to send a signal to his true believers that every idea, no matter how crazy-sounding, is welcome, given the party’s dire political straits. We can’t afford to tune him out.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "The Democrat roadblock was expected but “raises the prospect of Chair Powell staying on as FOMC chair (not Board of Governors chair) beyond May,” noted UBS.",
    "fullText": "President Trump’s plans for a more receptive Fed may have backfired so spectacularly that Jerome Powell may end up staying as chairman beyond the end of his term, while Stephen Miran, Trump’s most loyal supporter on the bank’s rate-setting committee, leaves the institution. \n\nTrump has repeatedly taken aim at the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve—often via personal insults—since launching his presidential bid. First, he wanted Powell to hold interest rates higher to avoid boosting President Biden’s ratings on the economy. After he won the Oval Office, he began lobbying for lower rates and has gone to unusual lengths to shape monetary policy, including multiple legal threats.\n\nLast week, he achieved a key aim: finding a replacement for Powell (whose term as Fed chair ends in May) who is suitably dovish, but isn’t seen as so close to the White House that it would spook markets.\n\nWhat criminal investigations involve Fed officials currently?\n\nWhy are Democrats blocking Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination?\n\nWhy did Stephen Miran resign from CEA?\n\nHow might Powell stay beyond his May term?\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor under Ben Bernanke, didn’t upset markets beyond potentially adding to the decline in precious metal prices with his hawkish tone on the central bank’s balance sheet. But Warsh may not shape the tone of conversations on the base-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as quickly as Trump might have hoped.\n\nThat’s because Warsh has to get through Senate Banking Committee hearings before being approved, and Democrats on the panel are refusing to proceed until criminal proceedings brought by the Trump administration against Fed members have been dropped.\n\n“We demand that you delay any nomination proceedings for Mr. Warsh until after the pretextual criminal investigations involving Chair Powell and Governor [Lisa] Cook have been closed,” banking committee Democrats said in a statement.\n\nCurrently, two members of the FOMC are facing court action: Powell himself and Fed Governor Cook. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has barred President Trump’s September attempt to remove Cook from her post on the basis of claims that she had fraudulently secured favorable mortgage terms before she joined the Fed. Cook denies the allegations.\n\nEarlier this month, Powell also confirmed he was under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. The renovation costs have been a point of debate between Trump and Powell, and the duo argued in July (in front of the world media) over whether the budget had been exceeded.\n\nThe Democrats added: “The [Warsh] nomination comes after months of repeated efforts by President Trump and his administration to influence the Fed by intimidation, including by opening criminal investigations into Fed Governor Cook and Fed Chair Powell. These ongoing efforts by the president to control the Fed—which must be able to exercise independent judgment—undermine public confidence in any nomination for chair at this time.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A government lawyer who told a judge that her job “sucks” during a court hearing stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota has been removed from her Justice Department post, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJulie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court “so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.”\n\n“What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,” Le said, according to a transcript.\n\nLe's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations. ICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation since ramping up in early January.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have left the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents. Le was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\n\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody.\n\n“And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,” the judge told Le.\n\nLe said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she “stupidly” volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. Le told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment. She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement.\n\n\"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don’t have a magic button to do it. I don’t have the power or the voice to do it,\" she said.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Le was a probationary attorney.\n\n“This conduct is unprofessional and unbecoming of an ICE attorney in abandoning her obligation to act with commitment, dedication, and zeal to the interests of the United States Government,” McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nLe and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nKira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because “so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.”\n\n“And there’s no indication here that any new systems or bolded e-mails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,” she added.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump will not be attending the Super Bowl after being warned he would likely be resoundingly booed by the crowd inside the stadium, according to a report.\n\nThe thin-skinned president had previously offered the unlikely excuse that he would not attend the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday in Santa Clara, California, because it was “too far away” and because he disliked the planned performers, Bad Bunny and Green Day.\n\nHowever, several of Trump’s advisers have now told Zeteo that the 79-year-old was urged not to attend the game in the deep-blue Democratic state because he would likely receive a less-than-friendly reception.\n\nClips of Trump being loudly booed in front of tens of thousands of spectators—and potentially more than 100 million viewers at home—going viral would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told Zeteo.\n\nTrump was met with a mixture of boos and cheers when he attended last year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nBut since then his approval ratings have plummeted across the board, with the president losing support over his handling of the economy and his hardline immigration policies, particularly in the wake of the killing of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nTrump’s dire polling numbers, combined with the Super Bowl being held in a state that has overwhelmingly rejected him in the past three presidential elections, led one aide to conclude it was “best to stay away from this one.”\n\n“Whatever [the crowd’s makeup] ends up being, it’s not gonna be a Turning Point USA speech,” the aide said.\n\nTrump told the New York Post last month that he would skip this year’s Super Bowl because he was unhappy that Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny would be performing the halftime show. Veteran punk rockers Green Day, who are also vocal critics of the president, are performing at the Super Bowl opening ceremony.\n\n“I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nTurning Point USA announced that MAGA country singer Kid Rock will headline its “All American Halftime Show,” scheduled to take place at the same time as the official halftime performance from Latin superstar Bad Bunny, who predominantly sings in Spanish.\n\nTrump also offered the dubious explanation that he was unwilling to travel to California because it was “just too far away,” despite regularly flying around the world and having attended last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nHe told the New York Post that he would be welcomed by the crowd if he dared to go. “They like me,” he said.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Davis Ingle insisted that Trump would receive a warm welcome if he attended Super Bowl LX in person.\n\n“President Trump is working hard on behalf of the American people,” Ingle told Zeteo. “If he did attend the Super Bowl, he would receive a warm welcome because America knows he has done more to help this country than any other president in history.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) was mockingly accused by critics on social media of trying to “out-Bible the Pope” after he attempted to use scripture to defend the Trump administration’s hardline immigration agenda.\n\nJohnson, a Southern Baptist, was asked to comment on Chicago-born Pope Leo’s citing of Matthew 25:35 as the current leader of the Roman Catholic Church urged “deep reflection” on how migrants are treated in the United States.\n\nPolitics: Maria Shriver Mocks Trump’s Closure Of The Kennedy Center With Her Own Vicious ‘Translation’\n\n“So you want me to give you a theological dissertation?” Johnson replied. “Alright.

We haven’t had a lot of that going on.”\n\nPolitics: Mike Johnson’s ‘Grade School’ Plea Gets A Red Mark For Hypocrisy Online\n\nJohnson claimed scripture requires civil authorities “to maintain order,” which he accused the Biden-Harris administration of not doing.\n\n“We did not take care of our borders,” he said. “Sovereign borders are biblical and good and right and they’re just, because it’s not because we hate the people on the outside, it’s because we love the people on the inside.”\n\n“We should love our neighbor as ourselves, as individuals, but as a civil authority and the government has to maintain the law and that is biblical and it’s right and it’s just,” he added.\n\nAfterwards, Johnson shared his argument in a 1,300-word post on X, formerly Twitter:\n\nIn the press gaggle following today's vote, I was asked to defend the Biblical case for border security and immigration enforcement. I did so, and then promised to post a longer explanation that I drafted during the Biden Administration.

That's the reason I am not winning as much.\n\n\"I am probably not a very good player any more and I have to accept that.

    "title": "Ford Worker Who Called Trump A 'Pedophile Protector' Reportedly No Longer Suspended",
    "description": "Personally, I'd probably take a nice, long vacation, buy a new Corvette, and then return to work.",
    "fullText": "When factory worker TJ Sabula called President Trump a \"pedophile protector,\" during a visit to a Ford plant in Dearborn, Michigan last month, Ford suspended him. At the time, though, it wasn't clear whether Sabula's suspension would ultimately lead to Ford firing him. He had the United Auto Workers Union's support, but even if he wasn't fired, would he even want to come back? That remains to be seen, but according to industry reporter Phoebe Wall Howard, the sources she's spoken with say Sabula's suspension has been lifted.\n\nIn a recent post on Substack, Howard reports her sources say that, not only is Sabula no longer suspended, he's also still \"a member of UAW Local 600 in Dearborn and employed by Ford.\" Whether he's already back on the job or still taking some time off isn't clear, though, and she was unable to reach Sabula to talk about his plans. Personally, I choose to believe he didn't return her call because he's on a beach somewhere, sipping cold, fruity drinks and not answering his phone, but that's more headcanon than a fact supported by evidence.\n\nWhen Howard contacted Ford for a statement, the representative declined, saying \"the company does not comment on personnel matters.\" Meanwhile, Laura Dickerson, a UAW vice president who oversees the union's Ford division, said the UAW still supports Sabula and has done its best to ensure he's treated fairly according to the terms of the contract, but she also said she couldn't comment further. That said, multiple unnamed sources reportedly told Howard that the contract Ford signed with the UAW would allow Sabula to take personal leave if he wanted to\n\nAs Howard points out, technically, Sabula was already on paid leave during his suspension while Ford tried to figure out what to do with him. Apparently, multiple sources \"...close to the situation\" told her that \"[a] secondary concern involved drama related to the employee's return to a politically diverse work environment,\" because \"[a] significant number of UAW members supported Trump on Election Day.\"\n\nWhether Sabula chooses to return to his job or not, the good news is, he shouldn't have to worry about money for a while. In response to Sabula showing more bravery than the supposed leaders of the Democratic Party, supporters started two separate GoFundMe campaigns to help Sabula out financially. Those GoFundMes ended up being so successful that, not only did they raise nearly $800,000, he also paused the campaigns and asked supporters to donate to other good causes.\n\nEven if Sabula doesn't plan to retire early in a foreign country with a low cost of living, after taxes, that's still a nice chunk of change that should give him plenty of options, including the ability to get more deeply involved in political organizing or advocacy. Personally, I'd probably take a nice, long vacation, buy a new Corvette, and then return to work, just to make everyone who supports the man who was best friends with Epstein uncomfortable, but I'm also petty and that may not be his style. Wherever Sabula goes, though, I hope he never has to pay for a single drink again.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge said Tuesday that he knows of no U.S. Supreme Court precedent to justify the Pentagon's censuring of a sitting U.S. senator who joined a videotaped plea for troops to resist unlawful orders from the Trump administration.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly had a front-row seat in a courtroom as his attorneys urged U.S. District Judge Richard Leon to block the Pentagon from punishing the Arizona Democrat, a retired U.S. Navy pilot. Leon didn't immediately rule from the bench on Kelly's claims that Pentagon officials violated his First Amendment free speech rights.\n\nBut the judge appeared to be skeptical of key arguments that a government attorney made in defense of Kelly's Jan. 5 censure from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n“You're asking me to do something the Supreme Court has never done,” the judge told Justice Department attorney John Bailey. “Isn't that a bit of a stretch?”\n\nBailey argued that Congress decided that retired military service members are subject to the same Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to active-duty troops.\n\n“Retirees are part of the armed forces,” Bailey said. “They are not separated from the services.”\n\nBenjamin Mizer, one of Kelly's lawyers, said they aren't aware of any ruling to support the notion that military retirees have “diminished speech rights.” And he argued that the First Amendment clearly protects Kelly's speech in this case.\n\n“And any other approach would be to make new law,” Mizer added.\n\nLeon, who was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush, said the Pentagon's actions against Kelly could have a chilling effect on “many, many other retirees who wish to voice their opinion.”\n\nThe judge said he hopes to issue a ruling by next Wednesday. Kelly shook hands with two government attorneys after the hearing.\n\nIn November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later. Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin. Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence communities.\n\nThe Pentagon began investigating Kelly in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment.\n\nHegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.",

    "fullText": "The Roman diocese headed by Chicago-born Pope Leo XIV has ordered a church in Rome to fix a fresco of an angel that was updated to bear a suspicious resemblance to one of President Donald Trump’s closest allies in Europe.\n\nAn Italian newspaper noticed over the weekend that a newly restored fresco at the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina in downtown Rome suddenly featured an angel whose face looked a lot like Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party.\n\nThe artist, Bruno Valentinetti, has denied modeling the angel after the prime minister, but the Roman diocese expressed its “disappointment” and vowed to investigate. On Monday, technicians from the diocese told the parish priest the painting needed to be changed to remove Meloni’s likeness, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported.\n\nAs pope, the 70-year-old Leo is also the Bishop of Rome.\n\nOriginally, the Basilica San Lorenzo parish priest, Daniele Micheletti, had defended the fresco, saying he didn’t think there was anything wrong with Valentinetti painting the premier’s likeness on an angel in a chapel dedicated to “holy souls.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean we’re Meloni supporters,” he told La Repubblica on Saturday. “Maybe we are Meloni supporters, but we don’t say so. The face of King Umberto II is also there, does that mean we’re monarchists?”\n\nBut the Roman diocese’s cardinal vicar, Leo’s close ally Baldassare Reina, responded to the news with a “firm” statement that “images of sacred art and the Christian tradition can be misused or exploited, as they are intended exclusively to support liturgical life.”\n\nAfter speaking to the diocese, Micheletti said the fresco would be modified. Archivists are looking for documentation of the original version of the fresco, which Valentinetti himself painted in 2000 within the historic basilica, which dates back to the 13th century.\n\nPope Leo has been an outspoken critic of many of Trump’s policies, including the president’s hardline immigration tactics and threats to invade foreign countries.\n\nHe shared some of those disagreements with the administration directly during a May sit-down with Vice President JD Vance, and has made a point of distancing himself from his older brother’s pro-MAGA politics.\n\nIn November, a White House spokesperson slammed Leo for saying that detained migrants should be allowed to receive communion.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at President Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction.\n\nThe 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds.\n\nA three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they \"express no view” on how he should rule.\n\nTrump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday's arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump's lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court.\n\nHellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case.\n\nThe first was after Trump’s March 2023 indictment; the second followed Trump’s May 2024 conviction and a subsequent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that presidents and former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts.\n\nIn the later ruling, at issue in the 2nd Circuit decision, Hellerstein said Trump’s lawyers had failed to meet the high burden of proof for changing jurisdiction and that Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records involved his personal life, not official actions that the Supreme Court ruled are immune from prosecution.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit panel said Hellerstein’s ruling, which echoed his previous denial, “did not consider whether certain evidence admitted during the state court trial relates to immunized official acts or, if so, whether evidentiary immunity transformed” the hush money case into one that relates to official acts.\n\nThe three judges said Hellerstein should closely review evidence that Trump claims relate to official acts.\n\nIf Hellerstein finds the prosecution relied on evidence of official acts, the judges said, he should weigh whether Trump can argue those actions were taken as part of his White House duties, whether Trump “diligently sought” to have the case moved to federal court and whether the case can even be moved to federal court now that Trump has been convicted and sentenced in state court.\n\nTrump was convicted in May 2024 of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels, whose allegations of an affair with Trump threatened to upend his 2016 presidential campaign. He was sentenced to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.\n\nTrump denies Daniels’ claim and said he did nothing wrong. He has asked a state appellate court to overturn the conviction.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Historians and observers accused the Trump administration of trying to rewrite American history to justify its own foreign policy decisions toward Latin America by posting a “historically inaccurate” version of the Mexican-American war.\n\nThe Monday statement from the White House commemorating the anniversary of the war described the conflict as a “legendary victory that secured the American Southwest, reasserted American sovereignty, and expanded the promise of American independence across our majestic continent.” The statement drew parallels between the period in U.S. history and its own increasingly aggressive policies toward Latin America, which it said would “ensure the Hemisphere remains safe.”\n\n“Guided by our victory on the fields of Mexico 178 years ago, I have spared no effort in defending our southern border against invasion, upholding the rule of law, and protecting our homeland from forces of evil, violence, and destruction,” the statement said, though it was unsigned.\n\nIn the post, the White House makes no mention of the key role slavery played in the war and glorifies the wider “Manifest Destiny” period, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Native Americans from their land.\n\nAlexander Aviña, Latin American history professor at Arizona State University, said the White House statement “underplays the massive amounts of violence that it took to expand” the U.S. to the Pacific shore at a time when the Trump administration has stuck its hand in Latin American affairs in a way not seen in decades, deposing Venezuela's president, meddling in elections and threatening military action in Mexico and other countries.\n\n“U.S. political leaders since then have seen this as an ugly aspect of U.S. history, this is a pretty clear instance of U.S. imperialism against its southern neighbor,” Aviña said. “The Trump administration is actually embracing this as a positive in U.S. history and framing it – inaccurately historically – as some sort of defensive measure to prevent the Mexico from invading them.”\n\nOn Tuesday, criticisms of the White House statement quickly rippled across social media.\n\nAsked about the statement in her morning news briefing, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum guffawed, quipping and noting “we have to defend sovereignty.” Sheinbaum, who has walked a tight rope with the Trump administration, has responded to Trump with a balanced tone and occasionally with sarcasm, like when Trump changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.\n\nThe Mexican-American war (1846–1848) was triggered by long-running border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico and the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845. For years leading up to the war, Americans had gradually moved into the then-Mexican territory. Mexico had banned slavery and U.S. abolitionists feared the U.S. land grab was in part an attempt to add slave states.\n\nAfter fighting broke out and successive U.S. victories, Mexico ceded more than 525,000 square miles of territory — including what now comprises Arizona, California, western Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah — to the U.S.\n\nThe moment turned Texas into a key chess piece during the U.S. Civil War and led former President Ulysses S. Grant to write later that the conflict with Mexico was “one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nThe Associated Press was formed when five New York City newspapers funded a pony express route through Alabama to bring news of the Mexican War — as it is sometimes known in the U.S. — north faster than the U.S. Post Office could deliver it.\n\nThe war continues to be a historical sticking point between the two countries, particularly as Sheinbaum repeatedly reminds Trump that her country is a sovereign nation whenever Trump openly weighs taking military action against Mexican cartels and pressures Mexico to bend to its will.\n\nThe White House statement falls in line with wider actions taken by the Trump administration to mold the federal government's language around its own creed, said Albert Camarillo, history professor at Stanford University, who described the statement as a “distorted, ahistorical, imperialist version\" of the war.\n\nAviña said the statement serves \"to assert rhetorically that the U.S. is justified in establishing its so-called ‘America First’ policy throughout the Americas,” regardless of the historical accuracy.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered the rewriting of history on display at the Smithsonian Institution, saying it was “restoring truth and sanity to American history.”\n\nThe administration has scrubbed government websites of history, legal records and data it finds disagreeable. Trump also ordered the government to remove any signs that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living,\" including those making reference to slavery, destruction of Native American cultures and climate change.\n\n“This statement is consistent with so many others that attempt to whitewash and reframe U.S. history and erase generations of historical scholarship,” Camarillo said.",

    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Tuesday the country should make “any sacrifice necessary” to preserve the independence of the country in the face of threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nHarper, a Conservative prime minister for nearly a decade from 2006 to 2015, made the remarks in a speech during his official portrait unveiling.\n\nHarper described the times as perilous and thanked current Prime Minister Mark Carney for attending the unveiling “at a time when challenges are unprecedented during our lives.”\n\nTrump has talked about making Canada the 51st state and has threatened the country with tariffs.\n\nThe Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance, alarming Canada, which shares a 3,000-kilometer (1,864 mile) maritime border with Greenland in the Arctic.\n\nHarper didn’t mention Trump by name but urged Canada’s two major parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, to unify in the face of threats to the country’s sovereignty.\n\n“We must make any sacrifice necessary to preserve the independence and the unity of this blessed land,” Harper said.\n\nHarper said he hopes his portrait is only one of the many portraits of prime ministers of both parties that will continue to be exhibited for decades and centuries to come.\n\n“But that will require that in these perilous times that both parties, whatever their other differences, come together against external forces that threaten our independence,” he said.\n\nHarper also warned against “domestic policies that threaten our unity.” A separatist moment in Alberta could garner enough votes this spring to trigger a referendum for independence from Canada.\n\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has said separatist support is about at 30%. Smith is pressuring the federal government and the British Columbia provincial government on the Pacific coast to approve a new oil pipeline to the Pacific.\n\nHarper approved of Carney’s resume when Carney applied to be the head of Canada’s central bank during Harper's time as prime minister. He joked the then-young man “has apparently gone on to enjoy some success.”\n\nCarney later became the head of the Bank of England in 2013 and prime minister of Canada last year.\n\nCarney thanked Harper for denouncing those who are threatening Canada’s sovereignty as Canada was confronted with unprecedented attacks and trade pressures.\n\n“He called on us to build a stronger Canada less dependent on the U.S.,” Carney said. “He also took the time to advise me which I have greatly appreciated.”\n\nCarney also commended Harper for his economic stewardship during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“He came to Ottawa as a balanced-budget conservative. He believed rightly that governments should live within their means. Yet when the financial crisis struck, he did not let ideology prevent him from doing what was necessary, running deficits for five years to support the Canadian economy through the worst global downturn in generations.,” Carney said.\n\n“Mr. Harper understood that you build up strength in good times to have the capacity to act in bad times.”",

And I blame the United States people for this too. They’re getting what they deserve because the last election was simple. You had the choice of the Constitution or the criminal. And for some reason, they took the criminal. So they shouldn’t be surprised at what they’re getting. He’s a convicted sex offender. He don’t pay taxes. Well, you know, he’s a draft dodger. Wouldn’t serve his country, and yet he stands out there and preaches patriotism,” Jesse Ventura said.\n\nSpeaking on the SpinSisters Podcast last week, Ventura floated the idea of Minnesota seceding from the United States and joining Canada after Trump suggested that the Great White North should become a U.S. state.\n\n“I am one that thinks, let me throw this out on your show and we’ll get some headlines. How about since Trump dislikes Minnesota so bad, and we’re so out of control, let’s join Canada?” Jesse Ventura asked.\n\n“Instead of Canada becoming the 51st state of America and lose their healthcare, like they said, they would never do that because they’d lose their healthcare. I’d like to see Minnesota, all of us become Canadians, and make this part of Canada, because it’s obvious Donald Trump don’t want us.”\n\nFans can check out his full comments here.\n\nVENTURA: \"I blame the United States people for this too.

    "fullText": "The government shutdown is ending. But the fight over funding for the Department of Homeland Security is far from over.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a package of funding bills on Tuesday afternoon that will end the four-day partial government shutdown.\n\nIt's still not clear how DHS will be funded in the long run.\n\nFunding for the department runs out on Friday, February 13, and Republicans have yet to agree to changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are demanding in exchange for supporting the funding.\n\nWithout an agreement, several government agencies will go unfunded, and if no bill to fund DHS passes for a long time, workers could miss paychecks.\n\nIt would also affect other agencies funded by the DHS bill, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Coast Guard.\n\nHowever, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection would be impacted less than other agencies. Republicans voted to give $75 billion for ICE and roughly $65 billion for CBP in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" in July.\n\nIn the wake of Pretti's killing, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer laid out three key demands on ICE:\n\nIn a Tuesday statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries backed up those points, while also calling for an \"end to the storming of sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, and hospitals.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Republicans will agree to any of those demands, leaving open the possibility that Democrats won't support a future DHS funding bill.\n\nWhile that may not be an issue in the GOP-controlled House, it would allow Democrats to block the bill in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats but 60 votes are required to advance most bills.\n\nThe partial shutdown began on Friday, after Senate Democrats demanded changes to funding for DHS in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.\n\nThe House had already passed a package of spending bills that funded DHS, along with the Department of Defense, the State Department, the Treasury Department, and other agencies.\n\nSenators came together and agreed to negotiate changes, passing a new version of the spending package that extends DHS funding for only two weeks in order to give time for negotiations.\n\nBut that bill still had to clear the House again, and with the lower chamber not scheduled to come back into session until this week, funding for those agencies ran out at midnight on Friday.\n\nThis shutdown was only partial, affecting fewer parts of the federal government than the 43-day long shutdown that occurred in the fall.\n\nThat's because lawmakers have already passed bills to fund various parts of the government, including the departments that fund SNAP and WIC payments.",

    "fullText": "This story was produced by the Berks County bureau of Spotlight PA, an independent, nonpartisan newsroom. org/newsletters/gooddayberks.\n\nUPPER BERN — The Trump administration has quietly purchased a nearly 520,000-square-foot warehouse in Berks County as it plans to convert such facilities into immigration detention centers across the U.S.\n\nThe warehouse, located at 3501 Mountain Road in Upper Bern Township, was sold to the U.S. government on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for $87.4 million, deed records show. The purchase was recorded on Feb. 2.\n\nSpotlight PA visited the warehouse, which is located about a mile from I-78, on Jan. 15 and witnessed about two dozen individuals touring the exterior of the building. One man who arrived early to the site that day identified himself to a reporter as ICE.\n\nThe property was most recently called the Hamburg Logistics Center, and before that was the site of the Mountain Springs Arena, a county landmark known for rodeos and demolition derbies. It neighbors an Amazon warehouse and the Mountain Springs Camping Resort.\n\nThe building is one of at least 23 that ICE plans to convert into an immigration detention facility, Bloomberg reports. The Berks County warehouse could house up to 1,500 beds.\n\nICE also finalized the purchase of a warehouse in nearby Tremont Township, in Schuylkill County, on Monday, according to a deed. The Tremont property is located less than 300 yards from a daycare center and has already faced fierce resident opposition.\n\nA spokesperson for ICE did not answer any questions about the Berks County warehouse purchase and instead lauded the agency’s targeting of “vicious criminals.”\n\n“Thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill, ICE has new funding to expand detention space to keep these criminals off American streets before they are removed for good from our communities,” the spokesperson said.\n\nUpper Bern Township’s solicitor said in an emailed statement that community leaders learned about the sale on Monday. They declined to answer questions.\n\n“The township was not involved in this transfer and has not received any applications from either the prior or new owners regarding the future use of the property,” the statement reads. “The township has no further comment on this matter at this time.”\n\nState Sen. Chris Gebhard and Rep. Jamie Barton, Republicans who represent the area, said they have reached out to federal contacts to gather more information on how the Department of Homeland Security plans to use the warehouse.\n\n“Our immediate concerns include the potential loss of property tax revenue for the host municipality, county, and school district, as well as security and perimeter considerations,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. “We look forward to engaging directly with the appropriate federal officials to address these issues. Once additional information is available, we will provide an update.”\n\nThe property is assessed at $22 million and currently pays $198,286 annually in county property taxes under the current tax rate of 9.013 mils. Combined with Hamburg Area School District and township taxes, the loss of tax revenue from the federal government’s purchase would be about $624,000.\n\nState Sen. Judy Schwank (D., Berks) declined to comment on the warehouse purchase on Monday. In an earlier interview with Spotlight PA, she called the then-potential sale “deeply concerning,” especially given the reports of mistreatment of people detained in ICE facilities. She released a statement about “ICE’s action in Minneapolis” on Jan. 27, shortly after federal agents killed Alex Pretti.\n\n“My concern is, knowing the track record of some of these other facilities located throughout the country, it’s not good,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to see something like that being housed in our county.”\n\nThe deed finalized on Monday shows the property was sold to ICE by an LLC connected to PCCP, a national commercial real estate equity firm. The firm purchased the warehouse in 2024 for $57.5 million, deed records show.\n\nReached by phone Monday afternoon, PCCP partner Greg Eberhardt — who is the authorized signatory for 3501 Mountain Road Owner LLC on the latest deed — denied knowledge of the property and its sale, and refused to comment further.\n\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eberhardt said before hanging up on a Spotlight PA reporter. “I’m not making company comments.”\n\nUpper Bern Township is situated on the edge of Berks and Schuylkill Counties, with a population of roughly 1,600 people. The community is mostly white, with only 2.8% of residents identifying as another race, according to the 2020 census.\n\nBridget Cambria, attorney with Aldea, a nonprofit that provides pro bono immigration legal services, said the detention center will have a “disruptive” and “chilling” impact on Berks County’s immigrant community.\n\n“If there are people that live freely and at peace knowing that they do the right thing, they can do their immigration process or stay with their family or figure out a way to legalize their status, they’re going to be more afraid to do that with a giant detention center in their backyard,” Cambria said.\n\nA 2022 study by the Detention Watch Center and the Immigrant Legal Resource Center found that immigrants were more likely to be arrested by ICE in counties with more detention bed-space.\n\nBEFORE YOU GO… If you learned something from this article, pay it forward and contribute to Spotlight PA at spotlightpa.org/donate.

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Immigration officers with guns drawn arrested activists who were trailing their vehicles on Tuesday in Minneapolis, while education leaders described anxiety and fear in Minnesota schools from the ongoing federal sweeps.\n\nBoth are signs that tension remains in the Minneapolis area after the departure of high-profile commander Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol and the arrival of Trump administration border czar Tom Homan, which followed the fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti.\n\n“There’s less smoke on the ground,” Gov. Tim Walz said, referring to tear gas and other irritants used by officers against protesters, “but I think it’s more chilling than it was last week because of the shift to the schools, the shift to the children.”\n\nAt least one person who had an anti-ICE message on clothing was handcuffed while face-down on the ground. An Associated Press photographer witnessed the arrests.\n\nICE agents are changing their tactics\n\nFederal agents in the Twin Cities lately have been conducting more targeted immigration arrests at homes and neighborhoods, rather than staging in parking lots. The convoys have been harder to find and less aggressive. Alerts in activist group chats have been more about sightings than immigration-related detainments.\n\nSeveral cars followed officers through south Minneapolis after there were reports of them knocking at homes. Officers stopped their vehicles and ordered activists to come out of a car at gunpoint. Agents told reporters at the scene to stay back and threatened to use pepper spray.\n\nHomeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said agents detained the activists because they hindered efforts to arrest a man who is in the country illegally.\n\nA federal judge last month put limits on how officers treat motorists who are following them but not obstructing their operations. Safely following agents “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge said. An appeals court, however, set the order aside.\n\nBovino, who was leading immigration enforcement in Minneapolis and other big U.S. cities, left town last week, shortly after Pretti's death became the second local killing of a U.S. citizen in January.\n\nHoman, who was dispatched to Minnesota to succeed Bovino, has warned that protesters could face consequences if they interfere with officers.\n\nOperation Metro Surge affecting schools\n\nWalz and education leaders held a news conference to say the presence of immigration officers is frightening some school communities. Brenda Lewis, superintendent of Fridley Public Schools in suburban Minneapolis, said she has been followed twice by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since speaking publicly on Jan. 27 and that school board members have had ICE vehicles outside their homes.\n\nLewis, a U.S. citizen, said she has seen SUVs with tinted windows, multiple masked people inside and out-of-state license plates. She goes on neighborhood patrols near schools with a security guard.\n\n“Students are afraid to come to school, parents are afraid to drop them off,” Lewis said. “Staff are coming to work wondering if today will be the day something happens in one of our buildings.”\n\nShe said Fridley, which has Somali and Ecuadorian families, has added security, adjusted drop-off procedures and increased mental health support. Tracy Xiong, a social worker in the Columbia Heights district, said she has been coordinating grocery deliveries to school families and finding volunteers to drive children.\n\nThere was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security and ICE about the concerns of educators.\n\nGrand jury seeks communications, records\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday was the deadline for Minneapolis to produce information for a federal grand jury. It is part of a U.S. Justice Department request for records of any effort to stifle the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Officials have denounced it as a bullying tactic.\n\n“We have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide, but when the federal government weaponizes the criminal justice system against political opponents, it’s important to stand up and fight back,” said Ally Peters, spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat.\n\nShe said the city was complying, but she didn't elaborate. Other state and local offices run by Democrats were given subpoenas, though it is not known whether they had the same deadline. People familiar with the matter have told the AP that the subpoenas are related to an investigation into whether Minnesota officials obstructed enforcement through public statements.\n\nNo release for man in Omar incident\n\nElsewhere, a man charged with squirting apple cider vinegar on Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar will remain in jail. U.S. Magistrate Judge David Schultz granted a federal prosecutor's request to keep Anthony Kazmierczak in custody.\n\n“We simply cannot have protesters and people — whatever side of the aisle they’re on — running up to representatives who are conducting official business, and holding town halls, and assaulting them,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Bejar said Tuesday.\n\nDefense attorney John Fossum said the vinegar posed a low risk to Omar. He said Kazmierczak's health problems weren't being properly addressed in jail and that his release would be appropriate.\n\nOrder for release of 2 men accused of assaulting ICE officer fails to stick\n\nAnother judge ordered the release of two Venezuelan men who were accused of assaulting an ICE officer, but ICE officials quickly took them back into custody.\n\nAlfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa-Celis are accused of assaulting the officer the night of Jan. 14. Sosa-Celis was shot in the thigh by the officer during the encounter, triggering protests in Minneapolis.\n\nThe officer said he was struck with a broom and snow shovel while trying to subdue and arrest Aljorna after a car crash and foot chase. But the two men deny assaulting the officer. Neither video evidence nor three eyewitnesses supported the officer’s account.\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson held a hearing Tuesday at which he rejected the government’s appeal of a magistrate judge’s order for the release of the two men on the criminal charges. Magnuson ruled that they could go free.\n\nBut an attorney for Sosa-Celis, Robin Wolpert, said in an interview that when she went to speak afterward with her client, who had been in the custody of U.S. Marshals, staff told her that ICE had taken him. She said she wasn’t sure why, or what their next steps would be.\n\nAljorna's attorney, Frederick Goetz, said he didn't know why ICE took his client or their next steps either.\n\nRaza reported from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

    "fullText": "New US-owned app struggled with a storm and was accused of blocking content critical of Trump – can it recover?\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m Blake Montgomery, writing to you from Doha, where I’m moderating panels about AI and investing as part of the Web Summit Qatar.\n\nI want to bring your attention to the impact of a Guardian story. In December, we published a story, “‘A black hole’: families and police say tech giants delay investigations in child abuse and drug cases”, about grieving families and law enforcement officers who say that Meta and Snapchat have slowed down criminal investigations. (The tech companies contend that they cooperate.) This month, Colorado lawmakers introduced a bill to compel social media platforms to respond to warrants in 72 hours.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life. It endured a major outage that stifled users’ ability to upload videos, which fueled a fierce user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an ascendant competitor and an inquiry by the California governor.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The day after the deal closed, its new owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed, the US weathered a fearsome winter storm and the killing of an American citizen by federal immigration agents. Both knocked TikTok off its feet.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on. The app suffered severe outages as a result. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings. Many of those same users cried censorship as they tried to express their outrage over Alex Pretti’s death via TikTok and found they could not. Prominent personalities said they would leave the app.\n\nAfter days of outcry, TikTok issued a statement ascribing the problems to the snow, ice and cold. That did not stop California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, from announcing the next day that his office would investigate the app’s alleged suppression of content critical of Donald Trump.\n\nTikTok’s late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. Upscrolled’s founder said in a conversation at the Web Summit Qatar that the app now boasts more than 2.5 million users.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well, though.\n\nElon Musk had more extensive ties to Epstein than previously known, emails show\n\nTesla discontinues Model X and S vehicles as Elon Musk pivots to robotics\n\nTwo dramas, both showing in New York, are highlighting how our collective anxieties about technology have shifted in the decade between their premieres.\n\nMarjorie Prime, now revived on Broadway but first staged in 2014, follows Tess (Cynthia Nixon), as she deals with the ageing, death and robotic recreation of her mother (June Squibb). The world of the play features “Primes”, android lookalikes of real people that attempt to emulate them for the comfort of those left behind, which Tess and her mother both engage with. Picture an Alexa, but it’s your dead husband, grandmother, etc. The play brings to mind the early worries about Siri, which debuted three years before the play. Since then, we’ve seen our own real-life versions of Primes: millions of people have digitally copied their deceased loved ones to varying degrees of uncanniness and success. Though its predictions are no longer far-fetched, the play remains moving. I found it touching.\n\nData, which premiered off Broadway last week, follows the talented young programmer Maneesh (Karan Brar) after he joins Athena Technologies, a clear analogue for the very real company Palantir. Maneesh is inducted into the company’s most elite team, data analytics, where he learns about clandestine work with the US government. He struggles with the ethics of the project. He wrestles with whether to expose it to the world in hopes of tanking it or keeping his head down. The play’s themes are quite familiar. They were playing out in headlines two days before I attended, and the Guardian has published stories about them.\n\nData is paced and plotted like a political thriller, more like House of Cards than Her. Seeing the two plays within a week of each other, I was struck by how much our concerns with tech have moved from the realm of science fiction into that of realism. Marjorie Prime is less literally concerned with tech, more with its emotional consequences. Data is about what it means to literally work as a software engineer. It seems unlikely to me that a play about the ethics of software in US bureaucracy could have sustained any tension in an era before this one.\n\nMarjorie Prime imagines a melancholy future; Data chronicles a version of the unpleasant present. The very real events of the previous year and Silicon Valley’s entanglement with the Trump administration loom over Data, for better and for worse. The play could not be more timely; it may feel dated by the end of year. Watching it felt like reading a yarn in the Wall Street Journal (or the Guardian, if I’m flattering myself).\n\nI am curious to observe which play ages better. Data serves as a real-time, red-hot record of our current moment, which may cool quickly. During the play, I was intrigued by some of its villains’ seemingly nefarious arguments in favor of the company’s work. What if the main character exposes the evil in the press and nothing happens, as his boss says? I have been part of multiple news cycles where that has been the case. What will plucky 22-year-old Maneesh do then? The question presents a more interesting, nuanced response to reality than Maneesh’s black-and-white, do-or-die plan to blow things up. By contrast, Marjorie Prime’s sentient artificial intelligence acts as a vehicle to discuss the age-old grief of a parent’s death and its aftermath.\n\nThe central question that both plays ask is not, in the end, one explicitly about technology, but about how to keep living beneath crushing weight. In Marjorie Prime, Tess struggles with the repetitiveness of her days and the robotic, constant reminder of her mother. She eventually succumbs to her despair, replaced by a robot herself, which torments her grieving husband with its pale simulation. In Data’s final, devastating scene, the secondary hero, Riley (Sophia Lillis, who gives the play’s best performance), asks how she can just go back to work, plagued as she is by moral concerns but trapped by monetary need, after failing to stop the company’s work. She trembles as her phone beeps, reminding her she’s late for her next meeting.\n\nWhat is Moltbook?

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s approval rating polls released at the start of 2026 indicate a gradual decline in public support for the President. One year into his second term, the data suggest that voter confidence has softened, even as his presidency continues to provoke strong reactions on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nThe polling data from early 2026 shows a decline in support for President Donald Trump as midterm elections near. Multiple surveys conducted in late January reveal a consistent trend: more Americans now disapprove of his job performance than approve.\n\nTrump’s approval rating is currently mired in the upper 30s to low 40s, while his disapproval consistently registers above 50%. This negative shift comes after a year of big policy moves and political upheaval. This includes a protracted government shutdown and aggressive federal budget cuts, as well as the controversial domestic deployment of U.S. troops (via Democrat & Chronicle).\n\nA New York Times survey puts his support at 41%, with 56% opposed. The Economist shows a similar 38% to 56% split. Meanwhile, pollsters like Rasmussen and Morning Consult show a slightly tighter race, with approvals at 46%. Others, like Pew Research Center and American Research Group, report a starker deficit, with unfavorable ratings reaching 61% and 63%, respectively. This broad spectrum of Donald Trump’s approval rating polls points to a challenging political environment for the White House.\n\nAnalysts suggest this dip is rooted in more than just policy disputes. A detailed Pew Research Center study from late January probed deeper into public trust, finding widespread skepticism. According to their report, “more Americans express little or no confidence in Trump than say they are extremely or very confident in him.” This deficit of confidence spans critical areas, including his leadership, mental fitness, selection of advisors, and commitment to democratic values and ethics.\n\nThe post Donald Trump’s New Approval Rating Polls Show Major Changes appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "CEO Alex Karp hails ‘iconic’ financial results despite criticism over contracts with ICE and homeland security\n\nPalantir celebrated its latest financial results on Monday, as the tech company blew past Wall Street expectations and continues to prop up the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants.\n\nPalantir has secured millions of dollars in federal contracts amid Trump’s crackdown on immigrants. The multibillion-dollar Denver-based firm creates tech focused on surveillance and analytics, to be used by the government agencies and private companies.\n\nPalantir’s biggest US customer is the Department of Defense; it also works with the Department of Homeland Security, and the majority of its revenue comes from deals with the federal government. Palantir reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m.\n\nPalantir has drawn further criticism over its role in the government’s immigration agenda, since federal immigration officers killed two protesters in Minneapolis last month.\n\nPalantir chief executive Alex Karp told CNBC in an interview Monday that Palantir helps protect sensitive data. “If you are critical of ICE, you should be out there protesting for more Palantir,” he said. “Our product, actually, in its core, requires people to conform with fourth amendment data protection.”\n\nThe company beat Wall Street expectations of $1.33bn with $1.41bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025. It reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.25 – which also surpassed Wall Street expectations of $0.23 in EPS. The company’s stocks jumped about 8% in after-hours trading after the release.\n\nKarp described the company’s growth on an earnings call as “one of the truly iconic performances in the history of corporate performance”. He wrote in a letter accompanying the earnings report that the $1.4bn in revenue generated in last year’s fourth quarter marks a new record – a 70% growth rate over the same period the year before.\n\n“We did this while supporting, in critical manner, some of the most interesting intricate, unusual, operations that the US government has been involved in – many of which we can’t comment on – but were the highlight of last year and highly motivating to all of us at Palantir,” Karp said.\n\nKarp doubled down on his data protection claim on the call, arguing that Palantir’s work with the US government, including intelligence agencies, aligns with the fourth amendment and makes sure “every institution that uses (Palantir’s) products is doing it within conformity of the law and ethics of America”.\n\nData privacy advocates are not convinced. “Palantir tools are ICE’s digital henchmen,” said Will Owen, communications director at the non-profit, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, in a statement to the Guardian. “Their revenue may be up thanks to Trump, but no one is buying that they hold ICE accountable.”\n\nLast year, ICE awarded Palantir a nearly $30m contract to build ImmigrationOS, which makes it easier to pull information about immigrants from across government databases – regardless of the accuracy of those records. 404 Media recently reported on the existence of another tool created by Palantir for the federal government: Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (Elite).\n\nElite “populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a ‘confidence score’ on the person’s current address”, according to 404 Media. The program reportedly relies on address data from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes Medicaid.\n\nWired reported last week that the federal government has been using Palantir’s AI tools to process immigration enforcement tips. Wired also reported that the health department has been using other Palantir AI tools to screen grants and job descriptions for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and “gender ideology”.\n\nPalantir has said there is no malicious intent in its work with the federal government.\n\n“To be absolutely clear, Palantir is not working on any master database project to unify databases across federal agencies,” read a company blogpost last week. “Palantir has not proposed the US government build a ‘master list’ for the surveillance of citizens, nor have we been asked to consider building such a system for any customer.”\n\nPalantir has described 404 Media’s claims about the Elite tool as misleading; the company says it is “used for prioritized enforcement to surface the likely addresses of specific individuals, such as those with final orders of removal or with high severity criminal charges”.\n\nTrump’s “big, beautiful bill” awarded DHS and ICE huge budgets to pursue the administration’s anti-immigrant policies, including $45bn for ICE to expand its detention capabilities.\n\nIn 2025, Palantir’s federal contracts almost doubled – and increased to more than $970m; this amount was distributed across the government, mostly to the defense department, but it also includes the DHS.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump wants the probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to continue.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Monday, a reporter asked Trump whether he would like the US Attorney for the District of Washington, Jeanine Pirro, to drop the investigation into Powell.\n\nHe replied that he wanted Pirro to \"take it to the end and see.\"\n\nTrump then repeated some of his criticisms of Powell, accusing him of spending excessive funds on the Federal Reserve building's renovation.\n\nPowell said on January 11 that the Fed had been served with grand jury subpoenas that threatened criminal indictment over the Fed's renovations. Powell said the probe was intended to force him to lower interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" he said in a video statement on January 11. Powell's term ends in May.\n\nThe investigation was the latest and most serious attack that Trump has launched against Powell. He has criticized the central banker on numerous occasions since he launched his presidential campaign.\n\nAfter Powell was hit by the probe, the world's central bankers rallied around him in support. The heads of central banks from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, and Canada, among others, said in an open letter that Powell is a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump announced his pick for Powell's successor as Fed chair on Friday. He picked Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and banker, to step into the role in May.\n\nRepresentatives for the Fed and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "U.S. voters are split on whether President Donald Trump is handling his job better than former President Joe Biden, according to a new poll.\n\nThe latest Harvard CAPS / Harris poll, released on Monday, showed that 51% of U.S. voters said Trump is doing a worse job as president than his predecessor. Forty-nine percent said Trump was doing a better job than Biden, which is down from the 53% who said the same in December.\n\nThe results were largely split along partisan lines, with 87% of Republicans and 15% of Democrats saying Trump was doing a better job than Biden. Eighty-five percent of Democrats and 15% of Republicans said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden. Fifty-six percent of independents said Trump was doing a worse job than Biden, and 44% said he was doing a better job.\n\nOverall, 46% of voters said Trump was doing a worse job than they expected. Just 28% said he was doing better than expected and 26% said he was performing as expected.\n\nThe poll also showed Trump’s approval rating in January slipped to 45%. This is a slight dip from the 47% approval rating he had in December, according to the poll.\n\nThe poll also asked respondents about whether Trump was doing a better job on handling the economy than Biden. Trump was largely elected to address affordability, jobs and inflation, but has had low approval ratings on those issues for months.\n\nVoters viewed the Trump administration as more responsible for the current state of the economy than the Biden administration, according to the poll. Sixty-three percent said the economy was mostly due to the Trump administration, while 37% said the same of the Biden administration.\n\nFifty-three percent said the economy is worse under Trump’s administration than Biden’s administration. Forty-seven percent said the economy is better under Trump, which is down from the 50% who said the same in December’s poll.\n\nThe poll was conducted Jan. 28-29 among 2,000 registered voters.

    "description": "President Trump called on Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.",
    "fullText": "\"We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called on Republicans to \"take over\" and \"nationalize\" voting as he continued to make false claims about the electoral process in the U.S. with the 2026 midterm elections on the horizon.\n\nTrump made the comments in an interview with former FBI Director Dan Bongino, who resigned from his post in December and returned to podcasting.\n\nTrump alleged noncitizen voting was improperly influencing election outcomes, though experts insist such instances are incredibly rare and already illegal, and told Bongino it was \"amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it.\"\n\n\"The Republicans should say, 'We want to take over,'\" Trump said. \"We should take over the voting ... in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes.\"\n\nThe Constitution gives states the authority to conduct federal elections, subject to laws passed by Congress. The elections clause states, in part, that \"state legislatures will establish the times, places, and manner of holding elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate.\"\n\nTrump didn't elaborate on how he wanted Republicans to \"nationalize\" voting.\n\nAsked by ABC News for specifics on what Trump meant, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded, \"President Trump cares deeply about the safety and security of our elections -- that’s why he’s urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, slammed Trump over his comments to Bongino.\n\n\"Just a few hours ago, Donald Trump said he wants to nationalize elections around the country. That's what Trump said. You think he believes in democracy? He said, 'We want to take over, the Republicans ought to nationalize the voting,'\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Does Donald Trump need a copy of the Constitution? What he is saying is outlandishly illegal.\"\n\nTrump's agenda is at stake in this year’s elections, where all seats in the House and 35 in the Senate will be up for grabs. Currently, Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers -- but midterm cycles are historically unkind to the sitting president's party.\n\nLast year, Trump and other Republicans pushed for mid-decade redistricting in order to gain additional House seats. The president warned Republicans last month that they have to win the midterms or he will get \"impeached.\"\n\nTrump also continues to litigate his 2020 election loss, spreading false claims of fraud.\n\nLast week, the FBI searched and seized original 2020 voting records from the Fulton County Elections and Operations Hub in Georgia, a swing state that went blue in 2020 and helped secure Joe Biden's victory.\n\n\"Now you're going to see something in Georgia where they were able to get, with a court order, the ballots. You're going to see some interesting things come out,” Trump said on Bongino's podcast.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration’s latest bid to limit lawmakers from conducting unannounced visits to immigration detention facilities, ruling that it likely runs afoul of oversight measures that Congress implemented.\n\nIt’s the second time U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb has sided with the group of Democratic lawmakers suing.\n\nCobb ruled in December that the Trump administration was violating a rider attached to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) annual appropriations package, which guarantees lawmaker access to detention facilities.\n\nLast month, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem re-implemented a notice requirement. It required 7-days’ warning for visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities being funded exclusively by the “Big Beautiful Bill” that Republicans passed last summer. That bill did not include the rider.\n\nCobb rejected the policy, crediting the lawmakers’ contention that it would be logistically difficult to segregate which expenses are being funded by which law.\n\n“Defendants’ declarant provides almost no details or specifics as to how DHS and ICE would accomplish this task in the face of the practical challenges raised by Plaintiffs,” wrote Cobb, an appointee of former President Biden.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to a DHS spokesperson for comment.\n\nThe suit was filed by 13 Democratic members of Congress: Joe Neguse (Colo.), Adriano Espaillat (N.Y.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), Robert Garcia (Calif.), Lou Correa (Calif.), Jason Crow (Colo.), Veronica Escobar (Texas), Dan Goldman (N.Y.), Jimmy Gomez (Calif.), Raul Ruiz (Calif.), Norma Torrez (Calif.) and Kelly Morrison (Minn.).\n\nTheir latest push in court came after the lawmakers said they tried to visit an ICE facility in Minnesota three days after the fatal shooting of Renée Good by a federal agent.\n\n“The Court’s decision today to grant a temporary restraining order against ICE’s unlawful effort to obstruct congressional oversight is a victory for the American people. We will keep fighting to ensure the rule of law prevails,” Neguse, a member of House Democratic leadership, said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers are represented by American Oversight and Democracy Forward Foundation, two organizations that regularly back lawsuits against the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "A newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch delivered a sharp warning to President Donald Trump after a high-profile Republican loss.\n\nIn a new editorial, The Wall Street Journal warned Trump that a hardline immigration strategy promoted by top aide Stephen Miller is fueling voter backlash.\n\nIt comes after a Trump-endorsed candidate for the Texas state senate lost to a Democrat over the weekend.\n\n“How does a Republican lose by 14 points in a safe conservative Texas state Senate seat that President Trump carried by 17 points in 2024? Answer: When there’s a voter backlash against the Trump Administration, notably its mass deportation debacles,” the Journal wrote, describing the special election in Tarrant County.\n\nDemocrat Taylor Rehmet, a labor union leader and veteran, easily defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss, who had Trump’s endorsement on Truth Social and vastly outspent her opponent.\n\nRehment is the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades.\n\nThe paper noted the timing was disastrous for Republicans, coming after the high-profile Minneapolis killings by federal immigration agents. “The 31-point vote swing in a little more than 14 months can only be explained as part of a rising tide of opposition to Mr. Trump’s first year and a sour public mood,” the Journal observed.\n\nThe White House has faced mounting national backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis—Renee Good in early January and Alex Pretti later that month—as part of aggressive enforcement operations in the state.\n\nBoth cases sparked controversy over conflicting official narratives. In Pretti’s case, Homeland Security officials and White House aides initially claimed he approached agents with a gun and posed a threat, while bystander videos show him holding only a cellphone before being pinned down and shot.\n\nSimilarly, authorities initially suggested that Good tried to ram agents with her vehicle before she was fatally shot, a claim contradicted by eyewitness footage and reporting. Critics argue these early statements painted both victims as dangerous to justify the shootings, fueling accusations that the administration misrepresented the events.\n\nThe killings came after Trump deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to Minneapolis as part of an aggressive immigration strategy masterminded by Miller.\n\nMiller’s immigration strategy under Trump has pushed aggressive mass arrests and deportations, with ICE agents pressured to meet high daily quotas, even targeting non-criminal undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal critiqued Miller’s hardline tactics, including a daily quota of 3,000 migrant arrests that it says “was bound to result in agent intrusions into homes and businesses.”\n\nWhile immigration has historically been a winning issue for Republicans, the Journal cautioned that enforcement “that turns ugly in the streets is turning off the swing voters who will determine who wins the race for Congress this year.”\n\nPolls have recently shown Americans turning on Trump and his immigration strategy ahead of the 2026 Midterms. A YouGov poll conducted on January 25 showed that about half (48 percent) of respondents do not think the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis was justified.\n\nAnother YouGov poll showed that 52 percent of Americans think the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict immigration to the U.S. have gone too far.\n\nAs a result, the paper concluded that even as Trump signals a desire to “dial back the confrontations on the street,” he must also reconsider Miller’s influence. “The Miller strategy isn’t likely to fare better this year,” the editorial warned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is not the first Murdoch-owned newspaper to publicly condemn Trump’s immigration strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published last week, the New York Post argued that the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minneapolis is backfiring politically.\n\n“These enforcement tactics won’t turn the tide, instead they are backfiring,” the Post wrote.",

    "description": "The president insists that the performing arts center and JFK memorial is \"run down,\" \"dilapidated\" and \"dangerous.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump doubled down Monday on his proposed plan to gut and renovate the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, telling White House reporters that he will “be using the steel” for the building’s existing structure and redo the rest.\n\n“Some of the marble comes down,” he said, adding, “It will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\nThe president came under fire Sunday after announcing plans to close the performing arts center and memorial to President John F. Kennedy for two years after controversially renaming it the Trump-Kennedy Center.\n\n“This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Sunday.\n\nMaintaining Monday that the center is “in very bad shape, it’s run down, it’s dilapidated, it’s sort of dangerous,” the president said the overhaul will cost “around $200 million” and spoke to his experience as a real estate mogul to back up the decision. (“In real estate and building, I’ve done so much of it, I’ve done so well with it.”)\n\nAsked by a reporter in the Oval Office if the renovation will tear down the arts center entirely, Trump said, “When it opens, it’s going to be brand new. Beautiful. I’m not ripping it down. I’ll be using the steel. So we’re using the structure. We’re using some of the marble and some of the marble comes down. But when it’s open, it will be brand new and really beautiful.”\n\n“So we’ll be closing it sometime around July 4. It’s, like, we’ll close it on July 4 in order to do something great for America. And then we’re building, we’ve got great contractors, we’re going to build it and we’ll do it right,” he said. “We’re using the highest grade marble, it’s the highest grade everything. It will be brand new.”\n\nQ: Do you plan on tearing the Kennedy Center down and how much will all of the renovations cost?\n\nTRUMP: Probably around $200 million. I'm not ripping it down. I'll be using the steel. So we're using the structure. We're using some of the marble. pic.twitter.com/Y8iy4QRowg\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 2, 2026\n\nThe late President Kennedy’s familiy were among the many figures decrying the construction project on Sunday, among them Jack Schlossberg, Maria Shriver and Joe Kennedy III.\n\n“Trump can take the Kennedy Center for himself,” Schlossberg wrote on X. “He can change the name, shut the doors and demolish the building. He can try to kill JFK. But JFK is kept alive by us now rising up to remove Donald Trump, bring him to justice and restore the freedoms generations fought for.”\n\nRep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), a former Kennedy Center board member, also spoke out Sunday.\n\n“Once again, Donald Trump has acted with total disregard for Congress,” she wrote in a statement. “The Kennedy Center is congressionally funded, and Congress should have been consulted on any decision to shut down its operations or undertake major renovations, especially for a two-year period.\n\n“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center. What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”\n\nTrump’s takeover of the performing arts center has led to declining performance at the venue’s theatrical and live event box office, with one report last summer finding a 50% drop-off in sales. Artists and executives alike have peeled off and canceled events at the center as well.\n\n“Let’s be clear: remodeling the premises will not restore the Kennedy Center to what it was,” Beatty concluded. “A return to artistic independence will. America’s artists are rejecting this attempted takeover, and the administration knows it. That is why they are now scrambling for cover.”\n\nThe post Trump Says $200 Million Kennedy Center Renovation Will Keep Steel Structure, Gut the Rest: ‘It Will Be Brand New’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "After the Trump administration sent federal agents to arrest journalist Don Lemon last week, despite a judge refusing to approve federal charges against him just a week earlier, Lemon is now released. And “The View” host Ana Navarro thinks the president should be worried, because they “picked on the wrong guy.”\n\nDiscussing the arrest during Monday’s Hot Topics, the ABC hosts largely scoffed at the move, calling it a tactic “to send a chilling message to anybody who is covering facts.” Navarro shredded the administration once again for “gaslighting” voters, and being “afraid” of truth getting out.\n\n“And I think they picked on the wrong guy, because Don Lemon is not going to play dead,” she said. “Don Lemon has the wherewithal, has the structure, has the team, has the courage and has the money to fight this administration.”\n\nDON LEMON ARRESTED OVER MN PROTESTS: 'The View' co-hosts react to freedom of press concerns being raised following the arrest of Lemon and Georgia Fort in connection with their coverage of protests at a Minneapolis church. pic.twitter.com/JMnpGQX7Wc\n\n— The View (@TheView) February 2, 2026\n\n“And he’s going to take it as far as it goes,” Navarro continued.\n\nHost Sunny Hostin readily agreed with that and, citing her experience as a former federal prosecutor once again, made an educated guess about how Lemon’s case will go in the legal system.\n\n“You know what happens next is that he will have his day in court, and I suspect that this case will be thrown out,” she said. “This case doesn’t have any merit.”\n\nHostin conceded that she is close friends with Lemon herself, but picked apart the idea that he was impeding any rights, which is what he was charged with.\n\n“I’ve been with Don in Ferguson. I’ve been with Don on the ground in South Carolina. Don is a journalist,” she said. “He’s an on-the-ground journalist. He has been pepper sprayed, he has been tear gassed, and he was getting the story, and nothing should have gotten in the way of that. He had a microphone with him, he had a cameraman with him, and he was practicing journalism.”\n\nYou can watch the full discussion from “The View” in the video above.\n\nThe post ‘The View’ Host Ana Navarro Says Trump Picked the Wrong Guy to Arrest in Don Lemon: ‘Has the Courage and Has the Money’ to Fight | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "Chief Justice John Roberts has started asking Supreme Court staff to sign non-disclosure agreements after a pro-Donald Trump judicial decision and memo were leaked to the press.\n\nRoberts, 71, likes to describe court members and employees as a family, and for years relied on more low-key measures to keep the court’s decision-making process secret, The New York Times reported.\n\nHe lectured clerks at the start of each term and distributed a written code of conduct that instructed clerks of their “duties of complete confidentiality, accuracy, and loyalty,” which only mentioned the possibility of unspecified sanctions in the case of breaches.\n\nBut two weeks after Trump was re-elected in 2024, Roberts summoned the court’s employees and asked them to sign legally binding NDAs requiring them to keep the court’s inner workings secret, five sources told the Times.\n\nThe agreements, which new arrivals have also been required to sign, threaten legal action if clerks or other members of the court’s support staff reveal confidential information, the paper’s sources said.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the justices themselves were also asked to sign confidentiality agreements, as the court declined to comment to the Times.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out for comment as well.\n\nRoberts’ crackdown follows a series of humiliating court leaks that have plagued the court since Politico was given a draft decision of the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson case that overturned the federal right to an abortion.\n\nThe court has also been rocked by revelations about disagreements among the justices, including a bitter debate about a case involving Idaho’s abortion ban, a battle over the court’s toothless ethics rules, and a confidential memo in which Roberts pushed to grant Trump broad immunity from prosecution.\n\nRoberts’ decision to impose NDAs came just weeks after the Times quoted from the confidential immunity memos, according to the Times.\n\nThe move comes as critics are calling for more transparency at the Supreme Court, which is facing record-low public trust as the conservative justices greenlight the vast majority of Trump’s policies.\n\nRoberts, however, went in the other direction and mandated more secrecy, not less.\n\nThe last time prior to 2024 that Supreme Court clerks were asked to sign a document agreeing to abide by the court’s confidentiality rules appears to have been in the late 1990s, after a former clerk published a tell-all book in 1998, according to the Times.\n\nThose documents, however, did not amount to legal NDAs, according to some of the clerks that signed them.\n\nThe switch to formal contracts is “a sign of the court’s own weakness” and the erosion of internal cohesion, Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor, told the Times.",

    "description": "Kevin Warsh, Trump's pick for Fed chair, is a good listener who seeks consensus, former colleagues say. That could shape how he would run the Fed.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect Kevin Warsh to be a bomb-thrower.\n\nSeveral longtime observers of the Federal Reserve told Business Insider that President Donald Trump's pick to become its next chairman is a good listener who looks for consensus.\n\nThat could prove essential for Warsh, who has emerged as a sometimes-vocal critic since leaving the central bank more than a decade ago. While some Fed watchers criticized Warsh's nomination, citing shifts in his stance on interest rates, others praised his experience and communication skills.\n\nIf confirmed as its next chair, Warsh would need to steer an institution increasingly caught between public pressure and the maintenance of a somewhat frayed internal consensus.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, for not cutting rates faster. That backdrop would likely test any incoming chair's ability to defend the central bank's independence.\n\nFormer colleagues say that Warsh understands the importance of the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That grounding, they say, could help him manage internal debates even as external expectations shift.\n\n\"Warsh has a very valuable skillset of insider experience and outsider critique,\" said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who worked with Warsh after 9/11, when Warsh served under President George W. Bush.\n\nWarsh proved easy to work with and adept at listening, Klein said — skills that matter when a leader must manage disagreement rather than impose direction.\n\nThe chair is only one of 12 votes on monetary policy, though that person also controls the Fed's \"incredibly powerful staff,\" he said.\n\nDonald Kohn, who spent 40 years at the central bank and worked alongside Warsh as a Fed governor, said in a statement to Business Insider that Warsh understands that the Fed's decision-making must remain focused on its dual mandate.\n\nHe has a good ability to read the room, said Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kohn said he worked closely with Warsh during the \"stressful years\" of the 2007-09 global financial crisis.\n\nThe ability to gauge a group's temperature could be critical. Warsh would be returning to a policymaking environment — and to staff and officials — he has publicly criticized in recent years.\n\nCongress set up the Fed so that it would be shielded from political pressure to juice the economy by slashing rates — and risk subsequent inflation.\n\n\"He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,\" Kohn said.\n\nThat matters in part because the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term rates, is divided; it hasn't voted unanimously since July. The committee was again split at its January meeting, when 10 members, including Powell, voted to hold on rates, while two sought a cut.\n\nIn recent years, Warsh has sharpened his critiques of the Fed, including in speeches and in his academic work at Stanford. In a 2023 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he called for \"regime change\" in US economic policy. Warsh criticized the Fed for being too slow to corral inflation after policymakers slashed borrowing costs in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKlein, who was a lead Democratic staffer on Warsh's original Senate confirmation in 2006, said that Warsh's critiques from academia have been \"reasonable and thoughtful.\"\n\nKlein added that Warsh's experience makes him an ideal operator to make changes at the central bank if he's once again confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"I hope he shakes up the Fed's decision-making process, which has gotten most of the major bank regulatory questions dead wrong over the last 30 years, while maintaining the Fed's independence on monetary policy,\" Klein said.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the critique.\n\nNot everyone sees Warsh as a change agent, despite his criticisms. There is a risk that his instinct to seek common ground could become a limitation, Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told Business Insider.\n\n\"He's consensus-oriented and not willing to jump too far out in front of the committee,\" Brusuelas said.\n\nIn reading policymaking transcripts from Warsh's time at the Fed, from 2006 to 2011, he came off as a follower rather than a leader, Brusuelas said.\n\n\"He's an echo, not the tip of the spear,\" he said.\n\nA leadership style that's focused on common consent and \"organized around protecting the status quo\" means that Warsh will likely \"always be late\" to needed policy shifts due to domestic or external shocks, Brusuelas said.\n\nWarsh didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAsked about the criticism, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that to restore confidence at the Fed, the president's primary considerations for a new chairman were \"competence and experience.\"\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is eminently qualified to hold the job,\" Desai said.\n\nFamed economist Mohamed El-Erian likewise sees Warsh as a good fit, writing on X that Warsh \"brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills.\"",

    "fullText": "If Trevor Noah really wanted a response from Donald Trump on his mocking question of “What are you going to do about it?” during the Grammys on Sunday night, the former Apprentice host just gave it to him, maybe.\n\nAs he has with so many critics, those who poke fun at him and almost anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump is threatening to take Noah to court.\n\nTrevor Noah Takes Shots At Nicki Minaj, Donald Trump’s Epstein Association & More During Grammys Show\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nAlex Warren Shares What He Heard During Grammy Audio Glitch: \"This Would Only Happen To Me\"\n\n“It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty,” the notoriously thin-skinned Trump posted online Sunday, not long after the Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny dominated the 68th annual Grammy Awards on CBS. “Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\nProving that he loves to watch and loves to remind everyone who has already kissed the ring and written the checks, POTUS’ long, enraged and uppercase-strewn post on his Truth Social platform denounced the music industry’s big night and Noah’s last turn as Grammy host. No surprise, it was all because of a bipartisan crack by the ex-Daily Show host about that past presidential pal and deceased pedophile Epstein — as you can see here:\n\nTrevor Noah takes another jab at Donald Trump #Grammys: “Song of the Year — that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein’s island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton” pic.twitter.com/quUWEpX4NL\n\n— Deadline (@DEADLINE) February 2, 2026\n\nGenerating a roar from the music crowd over his swipe at Trump, Noah’s quip of “what are you going to do about it?” was born out of the reality that 2026 is going to be his final time hosting the Grammys after several years fronting the shindig.\n\nTrump didn’t give a toss about any of that.\n\n“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump digitally raged. “WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\nThe remarks by Noah and the reaction by Trump comes just a couple of days after the MAGA Overlord’s Department of Justice dumped millions of redacted pages and hundreds of thousands of black-barred images from the long-delayed and much-anticipated Epstein Files. Still, with speculation that there is much more not out there despite congressional demands, Trump’s name comes up various times in what was released on January 30, including some pretty horrific allegations and new details. Among those also mentioned are L.A. Olympics boss Casey Wasserman, Elon Musk, ex-POTUS Clinton, Melania docu director Brett Ratner, Bill Gates (and some “Russian girl”), Jay-Z, the now-former Prince Andrew of Windsor, Harvey Weinstein, and of course Epstein’s right-hand lady and current federal convict Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile admitting he knew Epstein back in the roaring ’80s and ’90s, Trump always has denied he got up to anything inappropriate with or via him. As accusations against the one-time openly philandering Trump have been made by alleged Epstein victims and others (as well as cringy video of Trump and Epstein and correspondence between the two), little has made it to the courts connecting him to the horrors of sex trafficking and more.\n\nSuspicion of how deep Trump really went with Epstein, who died in 2019 by what was termed suicide in police custody has become a benchmark for Democrats and others – even when the likes of Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers have also been caught in the ugly web. The massive files release of January 30 even found Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche having to insist more than once the DOJ wasn’t and hadn’t been covering up for POTUS — to almost no avail.\n\nHaving started on CBS when Trump hero Richard Nixon was in the White House in 1973, tonight was the last time the Grammys will be seen on the now David Ellison-owned network.\n\nStarting in 2027, the ceremony will be broadcast on ABC as part of the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. As the Oscars leave ABC for YouTube in 2029, the Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from next year all the way to 2036 – when a then 90-year-old Trump will almost certainly not be president, maybe.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates.
