After that, Congress must vote to extend.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to that 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nThe president's Truth Social post on Saturday, while short on details, indicated he would raise that tariff to 15%.\n\nThe IEEPA-justified tariffs have been among Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements worldwide. They included Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\n\"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,\" the president wrote in his Truth Social post on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of the FCC, wants TV broadcasters to rally around the American flag in celebration of the U.S.’s 250th anniversary this year — suggesting that, for example, local stations could start “each broadcast day” with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nOn Friday, Carr announced the Pledge America Campaign, which he framed as part of the White House’s Salute to America 250 Task Force agenda, which “invites citizens to have a renewed love of American history, experience the beauty of our country, and ignite a spirit of adventure and innovation that will raise our nation to new heights over the next 250 years.”\n\nBrendan Carr Confirms FCC Has Begun 'Enforcement Proceedings' Against ABC's 'The View' Over Equal Time Issues\n\nCBS 'Censorship' of Stephen Colbert Slammed by Democratic FCC Commissioner as Latest 'Corporate Capitulation' to Trump Administration\n\nFCC Chairman Says There Are 'Legitimate Competition Concerns' With Netflix's Warner Bros. Deal - but His Agency Has No Authority to Review It\n\nAccording to the FCC, Carr is “heeding this call” put forth by the Trump White House with the Pledge America Campaign, which “enables broadcasters to lend their voices in support of Task Force 250 and the celebration of America’s 250th birthday by airing patriotic, pro-America content that celebrates the American journey and inspires its citizens by highlighting the historic accomplishments of this great nation from our founding through the Trump Administration today.”\n\nThe agency’s announcement comes as Carr has said he wants to help local TV stations push back against national networks on the amount reverse compensation that they pay for programming.\n\nCarr also has taken an aggressive stance in applying the FCC’s rules to fight against what he sees as pro-left bias in some national network programming. That has included his threat to investigate local broadcasters for “news distortion” if they aired “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Carr also has said the FCC “equal time” rule for political candidates will apply to daytime and late-night shows that are deemed to not be “bona fide” news programs. The FCC is investigating ABC’s “The View” for a possible violation of the equal-time rule after Texas politician James Talarico, who is running for the U.S. Senate, appeared on the show. This past Monday, Stephen Colbert said CBS lawyers blocked “The Late Show” from airing his interview with Talarico over concern that it would trigger the FCC equal-time rule.\n\nCarr, in a statement Friday, said, “The White House is leading our national celebration of this historic event with the Salute to America 250 Task Force, which calls on the federal government, among others, to mark this momentous occasion. As part of this effort, I am calling on broadcasters to pledge to provide programming that promotes civic education, national pride and our shared history.”\n\nCarr continued, “This type of programming is more relevant than ever, as surveys show that civics education is in rapid decline. And classic programming such as ‘Schoolhouse Rock!’ is now only found in online archives. Broadcasters are uniquely positioned to help address these concerning developments by providing programming that celebrates the remarkable story of American Independence while also tailoring it to the specific needs of their local communities, in furtherance of their public interest obligations.”\n\nThe FCC’s GOP chairman also provided examples of “nonpartisan” celebratory pro-American programming:\n\nRunning PSAs, short segments or full specials specifically promoting civic education, inspiring local stories, and American history\n\nIncluding segments during regular news programming that highlight local sites that are significant to American and regional history, such as National Park Service sites\n\nStarting each broadcast day with “The Star-Spangled Banner” or Pledge of Allegiance\n\nAiring music by America’s greatest composers, such as John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington or George Gershwin\n\nProviding daily “Today in American History” announcements highlighting significant events that took place on that day in history\n\nPartnering with community organizations and other groups that are already working hard to bring America’s stories of unity, perseverance, and triumph to light\n\n'Goat' Cast Guide: All the Celebrities and NBA Stars Voicing Animals in the Basketball Movie\n\nOscars: Original Screenplay — 'Sinners,' 'Sentimental Value' and 'Blue Moon' Gain More Popularity Among Voters\n\nWhat’s Coming to Netflix in February 2026",

    "fullText": "HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.\n\nThe nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.\n\nEnergy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.\n\nPresident Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.\n\nSkeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.\n\nWright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.\n\n“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.\n\nThe minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.\n\n“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.\n\nCurrently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.\n\nRecognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nMicroreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.\n\nThe demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.\n\nThe reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.\n\nEdwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.\n\nThe flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.\n\nThe Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.\n\nOfficials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.\n\nThe microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.\n\n“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”",

    "fullText": "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Friday said the quickest way to have President Trump act on tariffs “is to tell him that he can’t,” after the Supreme Court ruled that his use of emergency powers to enact his sweeping tariff agenda was unconstitutional.\n\nThe high court’s 6-3 ruling invalidated Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose steep import taxes on almost all foreign trading partners. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the IEEPA does not apply to the tariffs.\n\nSanders, in an interview with NewsNation’s Katie Pavlich, said the court’s ruling was “not only disappointing” but “I think it’s wrong.”\n\n“I think Justice [Clarence] Thomas was exactly right,” she continued. “The Constitution grants the president this authority. “But ultimately, I don’t think it matters. One of the things I love about Donald Trump is that the fastest way to get him to do something is to tell him that he can’t. And he has so many tools in his toolbox.”\n\nThe GOP governor added that Trump will “use whatever tool and resource he needs to get that job done.”\n\n“And while this may, you know, take over the news cycle for a few days, I don’t think it changes what the outcome looks like and that this is a president who’s going to continue to hold other countries feet to the fire,” she said. “He’s going to make sure that American workers are put first.”\n\nTrump called the ruling “disappointing” and lashed out at Roberts and five other justices, including Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — whom he appointed to the bench —calling them all “fools and lapdogs.“\n\n“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth. The two of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House Friday.\n\nHe praised Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a dissent. The president said he was “proud” of Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed in 2018.\n\nThe president followed the ruling with the announcement that he signed an executive order to impose a 10 percent tariff on imports from countries around the world “effective immediately.” He invoked Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, a provision that allows for tariffs of up to 15 percent for 150 days to address “large and serious” trade deficits, to enact the new levies.\n\nThe White House said Canada and Mexico are exempt from the new tariffs due to the trilateral free trade agreement that was ratified during Trump’s first term in 2020.\n\nSome Republican members of Congress also broke with the president, hailing the Supreme Court ruling as a victory for free trade, the separation of powers, or both.\n\n“Today’s ruling affirms, despite all the noise of the moment, that the Founders’ system of checks and balances remains strong nearly 250 years later,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on the social platform X.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), in his own post online, said the court’s ruling “will also prevent a future President such as AOC from using emergency powers to enact socialism,” referring to potential 2028 presidential contender Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).",

    "description": "Marc Bowker, a small business owner, said Trump continues to cause uncertainty for small businesses after Supreme Court tariff ruling.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Marc Bowker, owner of Alter Ego Comics, a comic book shop in Lima, Ohio, after the Supreme Court overturned some of President Donald Trump's tariffs. This story has been edited for length a clarity.\n\nMy first reaction to the Supreme Court decision was, \"This is awesome and long overdue.\" The second was, \"Okay, what's next?\"\n\nThen I saw the president say there would now be a new 10% global tariff and that the Supreme Court justices who ruled against him are unpatriotic and unloyal. So it feels like this is going to drag on forever and ever until he gets his way. It's like death by a thousand paper cuts.\n\nI think there are more questions remaining than answers. I appreciate the Supreme Court siding with Americans and American businesses, but it feels like it's going to be a tug-of-war that may go on throughout this entire administration.\n\nThis administration has created a level of uncertainty in the small business landscape that I haven't seen in 23 years of owning my store.\n\nIn addition to being a small-business owner in America, I'm a consumer in America, so I'm paying more for everything that my family consumes, from food to physical products. It's a one-two punch for us.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet of every shipment that had a tariff charge, and as of today, we've paid over $12,000 since Trump started all of this.\n\nWe've had to pass on a percentage of that to our customers, and as a result, we've seen a slowdown in orders. Some are taking a wait-and-see mentality, or they just don't want to pay the extra fee.\n\nComics themselves — a lot of which are printed in Canada — have not been impacted by tariffs. But for me and for other comic book stores, action figures, board games, and comic book supplies, like storage items, are being impacted. Action figures account for about 65% of my shop's revenue, and they are made in China.\n\nA lot of these orders are made far in advance, too. We were being charged tariffs on items ordered in 2023 and 2024. There's stuff I need to order next week that ships in June of 2027. Is the tariff going to be 6%? Is it going to be zero? Is it going to be 100%? I have no idea.\n\nAs for the tariff costs small businesses have already paid, are we getting that back? Probably not. Are the corporations that paid the bulk of the tariffs going to be reimbursed? Where does that come from? I feel like this is just going to cause more paperwork, more red tape, more headaches. I don't know what the next step is.\n\nIf I could wave a magic wand, yes, there would be some reimbursement of the fees that all American businesses have had to pay. If I had to settle for something, it would be that, effective today, there are no more of these Trump tariffs.\n\nIt's hard to be excited about the Supreme Court ruling when, within hours, the White House says it's going to push back with more tariffs.\n\nThe administration is throwing so much at us every day that we can't make any progress. It's hard to see what the future will look like.\n\nI would hate to see this stretch on the next three years of the administration. It's going to take all this extra time that could be spent running our businesses and serving our customers, just trying to stop the government from getting its hands in our pockets.\n\nIt really feels like our elected officials are not listening to us. Historically, the Republican Party has been promoted as the party of business in the United States. If they truly were, they would be listening to constituents who are saying these tariffs are hurting our businesses.",

    "description": "According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have been wrong on Trump's policies.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's economic policies have not led to the dire scenarios of recession or steep inflation that many economists have warned about over the last year. According to new commentary from the Brookings Institution, there are a few major reasons that economists have so far gotten it wrong.\n\nTrump has challenged the conventional economic norms in multiple ways that economists have warned would stress the system.\n\nTrump's tariffs were struck down by the Supreme Court on Friday, but experts spent the year leading up to the decision predicting dire consequences from the sweeping trade policy. For the most part, though, downbeat assessments of tariffs and other Trump policies haven't come to pass.\n\nTrump has used tariffs aggressively and cracked down on immigration, shrinking the labor force, yut the economy has mostly held strong with unemployment still historically low and consumers still spending. He's also tried to erode the Federal Reserve's independence and has added to the national debt with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Interest rates haven't had a big reaction to either development, both of which could be viewed as inflationary.\n\nBen Harris, vice president and director of Economic Studies at Brookings, put out some explanations for the discrepancies this week.\n\nFirst, Brookings thinks everything has turned out better than some expected because the negative impacts of Trump's policies and actions were overestimated to begin with. The Fed is difficult to influence, tariffs aren't as steep as originally thought, and the pass-through to consumers has been smaller than expected.\n\n\"Perhaps mainstream economic models are simply wrong,\" Harris wrote. \"Is it possible the economics profession overstated the value of immigration, free trade, Fed independence, and a sustainable fiscal outlook?\"\n\n\"It's entirely possible that this volatile episode in American policymaking will lead to a greater understanding of the US economy,\" he continued. \"There could be one enduring lesson—learned both over the course of 2025 as well as during the pandemic—that the size and diversity of the U.S. economy usually protects it from sharp downturns.\"\n\nSecond is the positive fiscal impact of both the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — the GOP's landmark tax and spending bill — and of all the corporate spending on AI development. Harris pointed out that AI capex accounted for 40% of GDP in 2025; Goldman Sachs sees consumers' disposable incomes expanding by 0.4% in the first six months of 2026 thanks to the OBBBA; and foreign investors have pledged to spend billions of dollars in the US amid Trump's trade wars.\n\nThird and finally, Harris said we may not have seen the final impact of Trump's policies, and it's still too early to issue a verdict on them.\n\n\"This explanation is consistent with economic theory and evidence. The economic impact of curtailed immigration and mass deportations can take years to materialize,\" Harris wrote.\n\n\"The complexity of the FOMC's composition means that it may take years until we see the full impact of political influence,\" he added. \"And on tariffs, as we have heard from our western trading partners recently in Davos, only now have they begun to explore alternatives to the U.S. in terms of trade and investment decisions.\"",

    "description": "The watch world is rejoicing over the Supreme Court's ruling on Trump's tariffs as dealers say the prices of pre-owned Swiss watches could dip.",
    "fullText": "The watch world breathed a collective sigh of relief over the Supreme Court's decision on President Donald Trump's trade policy.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision on Friday, the court ruled that imposing most of Trump's tariffs exceeded his authority under a 1970s law. The ruling is a hefty blow to the policies he put in place against foreign countries, which companies have had to reckon with for nearly a year.\n\nWatch dealers have told Business Insider that they and their shoppers stand to benefit from the ruling. Pre-owned watch retailer SwissWatchExpo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said it would likely lead to lower pre-owned watch prices in the next six months — he expects declines of 2% to 3%. Without tariffs looming overhead, the market is poised to snap back faster than retail prices as sellers set their prices and buyers take the deals.\n\n\"Supply will loosen up, and purchasing power goes right back to the collector where it belongs,\" Tutunikov said.\n\nA break from tariffs would make the entry point for luxury watch collecting more accessible.\n\nCue the celebrations among Swiss watch lovers who've been caught in a storm of retail price increases from leading brands like Rolex over the past year. Supply chain constraints also made it harder to do business in the secondhand market.\n\nTariff tensions between Switzerland and the US have been up and down since Trump's Liberation Day. US imports of Swiss goods faced a baseline tariff of 10% from April 2025 until Trump eventually raised it to 39%, sending shockwaves through the watch industry. The two countries continued negotiations until Trump agreed to lower the rate to 15% after speaking with Rolex and other Swiss companies.\n\nTrump clapped back at the nation's highest court over its Friday ruling, saying he'd find alternative ways to keep his trade agenda intact.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law referenced in the court's ruling.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's move is still a win in the books of watch dealers who've said the decision would allow pricing in the pre-owned market to return to being based on value and demand rather than tariffs.\n\n\"If they are indeed lifted, we expect it would meaningfully improve sentiment across the industry, increase access to important pieces, and ultimately benefit collectors, retailers, and brands alike,\" said Joshua Ganjei, CEO of European Watch Company, which sells pre-owned and vintage watches.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump warned on Friday that limited strikes against Iran are possible even as the country’s top diplomat said Tehran expects to have a proposed deal ready in the next few days following nuclear talks with the United States.\n\nIn response to a reporter's question on whether the U.S. could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a TV interview that his country was planning to finalize a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.\n\n“I don’t think it takes long, perhaps, in a matter of a week or so, we can start real, serious negotiations on the text and come to a conclusion,” Araghchi said on MSNOW's “Morning Joe” show.\n\nThe tensions between the longtime adversaries have ramped up as the Trump administration pushes for concessions from Iran and has built up the largest U.S. military presence in the Middle East in decades, with more warships and aircraft on the way.\n\nOn Friday, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and entered the Mediterranean Sea after being sent by Trump from the Caribbean, according to images of the ship by maritime photographers posted to social media.\n\nBoth Iran and the U.S. have signaled that they are prepared for war if talks on Tehran’s nuclear program fizzle out. “We are prepared for diplomacy, and we are prepared for negotiation as much as we are prepared for war,” Araghchi said Friday.\n\nAli Vaez, an Iran expert at the International Crisis Group, said Iran “would treat any kinetic action as an existential threat.”\n\nVaez said he doesn’t think Iran’s leaders are bluffing when they say they would retaliate, while they likely believe they could maintain their hold on power despite any U.S. airstrikes.\n\nTrump said a day earlier that he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal following recent rounds of indirect negotiations, including this week in Geneva, that made little visible progress. But the talks have been deadlocked for years after Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has refused to discuss wider U.S. and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.\n\nAraghchi also said Friday that his American counterparts have not asked for zero enrichment of uranium as part of the latest round of talks, which is not what U.S. officials have said publicly.\n\n\"What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear program, including enrichment, is peaceful and will remain peaceful forever,\" he said.\n\nHe added that in return, Iran will implement some confidence-building measures in exchange for relief on economic sanctions.\n\nIn response to Araghchi’s claim, a White House official said Trump has been clear that Iran cannot have nuclear weapons or the capacity to build them and that it cannot enrich uranium. The official wasn’t authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTehran has long insisted that any negotiations should only focus on its nuclear program and that it hasn’t been enriching uranium since U.S. and Israeli strikes last June on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump said at the time that the strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear sites, but the exact damage is unknown as Tehran has barred international inspectors.\n\nAlthough Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, the U.S. and others suspect it is aimed at eventually developing weapons.\n\nTrump's comments have faced pushback from some lawmakers who say the president should get Congress' approval before any strike.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Friday that he has filed a war powers resolution that would require that step. Though it has no chance of becoming law — in part because Trump himself would have to sign it — some bipartisan consensus has arisen recently among senators who forced votes on previous resolutions on military action in Venezuela.\n\nNone of those resolutions passed, but they were successful in showing how lawmakers are troubled by some of Trump’s aggressive foreign policy maneuvers.\n\n“If some of my colleagues support war, then they should have the guts to vote for the war, and to be held accountable by their constituents, rather than hiding under their desks,” Kaine said in a statement.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price, Ben Finley, Stephen Groves and Konstantin Toropin in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.\n\n“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.\n\nHundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nThat prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.\n\nHalligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.\n\nU.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.\n\nLast week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.",

    "fullText": "Three conservative justices of the US Supreme Court — Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito — broke with the majority Friday, arguing that President Donald Trump had clear authority to impose his sweeping tariff policy.\n\nThe three dissenting justices said the president's tariffs were perfectly legal under the 1970-era law Trump used that says presidents can \"regulate\" importation in the case of emergencies.\n\n\"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful.\"\n\nThe three justices also noted that the majority 6-3 decision is silent on how to return billions of dollars in tariffs that have already been collected.\n\nThat process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" as was acknowledged at oral arguments, Kavanaugh wrote in a lengthy dissent that Thomas and Alito joined.\n\nThe two dissents differed with the majority on two fronts: Trump's bypassing of Congress in imposing tariffs, and the legality of the president's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.\n\nIn the dissent written by Kavanaugh, the justices argued that presidents have \"commonly\" imposed tariffs to regulate imports throughout American history.\n\nInterpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs \"creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" Kavanaugh wrote. As with quotas and embargoes, tariffs are a \"traditional and common tool to regulate importation,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not make much sense to think that IEEPA allows the President in a declared national emergency to, for example, shut off all or most imports from China, but not to impose even a $1 tariff on imports from China,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nReversing the tariffs may be an exercise in futility, Kavanaugh added. Even without IEPPA, \"numerous other federal statutes authorize the president to impose tariffs and might justify most (if not all) of the tariffs at issue in this case,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nIn a separate dissent, Thomas wrote that \"neither the statutory text\" of IEEPA \"nor the Constitution provide a basis for ruling against the President.\"\n\n\"This Court has consistently upheld Congress's delegation of power over foreign commerce, including the power to impose duties on imports,\" Thomas wrote. \"The Court has long conveyed to Congress that it may 'invest the President with large discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce with other nations.'\"\n\nIn remarks at the White House following the Supreme Court's decision, Trump praised the three dissenting justices while bashing the others.\n\n\"I'd like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is right now, very proud of those justices,\" Trump told reporters. \"When you read the dissenting opinions, there is no way that anyone can argue against them — there is no way.\"\n\nTrump called the Supreme Court ruling \"deeply disappointing\" and said he was \"ashamed of certain members of the court.\"",

    "description": "The process for IEEPA tariff refunds will likely go through the Court of International Trade. Already, over 1,000 lawsuits are pending.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday overturned the centerpiece of President Donald Trump's tariff plans, ruling the federal government illegally collected over $133 billion in taxes from American businesses.\n\nNow comes the battle over refunds for tariffs paid, which Trump on Friday predicted could take years.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said at a White House press conference, while blasting the ruling as \"terrible\" and \"defective.\"\n\nUS Secretary of the Treasury went a step further, saying about refunds: \"I've got a feeling the American people won't see it.\"\n\nOne reason: Over 1,000 companies have filed lawsuits to claw back money from the government if the Supreme Court overturned Trump's tariffs justified by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also predicted the process could become a \"mess,\" citing refund requests tallying \"billions of dollars to importers,\" even as some importers have already passed those costs to consumers.\n\nHere are all your questions about tariff refunds, answered by experts.\n\nTypically, the refund process would be handled by Customs and Border Protection, which collected the tariffs in the first place.\n\nIn order for that to happen, the Trump administration would need to establish a process for handling refund requests. The White House, which didn't return Business Insider's request for comment, has yet to signal plans to do this, said Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nWithout a formal process in place, claims will be litigated in the Court of International Trade, which will order CPB to issue refunds to specific companies, Brewster said.\n\nIn the past, the Court of International Trade has ordered refunds when it has found particular taxes to be invalid — albeit on a smaller scale, according to Daniel Mach, a commercial litigator at Bryan Cave.\n\nIt'll likely turn to the process that followed a 1998 Supreme Court decision to overturn a harbor maintenance tax, which also resulted in refunds, Mach said.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" Mach said. \"Everyone's going to be kind of figuring out the ropes as they go. But at the end of the day, it's not an unsolvable problem.\"\n\nGiven the number of claims, the Court of International Trade is likely to appoint an administrator or special master to consider each of them, rather than handling the lawsuits piecemeal, Mach said.\n\nGroups that advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the IEEPA tariffs have urged the Court of International Trade to develop a smooth process for refunds.\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" said David French, an executive at the National Retail Federation, in a statement.\n\nThe whole refund process — whether through CPB or through a class-action or administrative processes in court — could take up to two years, according to Brewster.\n\nYes! The cases that went to the Supreme Court were groups of small companies, including a wine importer and an educational toy retailer. But several massive corporations, including Toyota and Costco, have also filed refund lawsuits.\n\nYou can try to get a refund for personal orders hit by tariffs, but it'll be complicated.\n\nIn asking CPB or a court for a refund, you'll have to distinguish tariffs you paid pursuant to IEEPA, which were overturned, and the tariffs justified by other laws, which remain on the books.\n\nIndividual lawsuits for IEEPA tariffs on individual retailer orders, like from Temu and Shein, likely won't be worthwhile. The legal fees would likely exceed any potential refund. But it's possible that some enterprising litigators would put together a class-action lawsuit to make it worthwhile, Brewster predicted.\n\n\"It was an illegally imposed tax,\" she said. \"So in theory, everyone is entitled to a refund.\"\n\nWith reporting by Brent Griffins",

    "fullText": "Wall Street is weighing the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling against Trump's tariffs, with investors on the hunt for stocks that stand to gain the most from the reversal of the landmark trade policy.\n\nSCOTUS ruled that Trump can't use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify tariffs. Following the announcement, Jefferies analysts highlighted five stocks that they say have the \"largest upside benefit\" on the court's decision.\n\n\"The removal of IEEPA tariffs introduces a meaningful margin tailwind across our consumer discretionary coverage,\" the analysts wrote.\n\n\"While the ruling eliminates the legal authority for these tariffs, questions remain around remedies—most notably whether companies will be entitled to refunds for duties already paid,\" they added.\n\nHere are five stocks that Jefferies sees as best-positioned to gain after the SCOTUS tariff decision.\n\nJefferies analysts said Signet Jewelers is a primary beneficiary of the tariff decision.\n\nThe company sources roughly half of its inventory from India since the country is a global hub for both natural and lab-grown diamonds.\n\nWith the SCOTUS ruling, Signet Jewelers' weighted‑average tariff exposure falls to 0% from 15.1%, creating an opportunity for margin expansion and earnings growth, Jefferies analysts wrote.\n\nPrior to the SCOTUS ruling, Yeti had a nearly 15% exposure to tariff-related sources, concentrated in its US revenue.\n\nThe company told investors there was a $0.35 earning per share impact from the IEEPA tariffs, meaning that the decision will eliminate tariff pressures going forward.\n\nSharkninja proactively mitigated tariff impact by diversifying its supply chain, supply concessions, strategic pricing, and promotions.\n\nEven with these efforts, the company still saw tariff-related margin headwinds.\n\nSCOTUS's decision will turn this pressure into a benefit for the company, as the already successful operational shifts, along with the removal of the tariffs, will further boost earnings.\n\nNike embedded a 7.7% tariff exposure into its fiscal 2026 guidance. This would have amounted to a $1.5 billion cost for the athletic wear company.\n\n\"The elimination of IEEPA tariffs now flips this dynamic into a margin tailwind, supporting incremental gross margin expansion through FY26,\" Jefferies wrote.\n\nBirkenstock worked a nearly 7% weighted‑average tariff impact into their guidance.\n\nThe SCOTUS news turns the margin headwind into a tailwind to fuel outperformance compared to the company's outlook, Jefferies said.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court blocked Trump's IEEPA tariffs, but he has other ways to impose sweeping duties — some of which are already being dusted off.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Friday knocked down President Donald Trump's controversial tariffs, ruling that the president overstepped his authority by relying on a law normally reserved for emergencies.\n\nThe high court ruling, however, only curbed the president's most flexible tool for reshaping global trade. Taxing imports is central to Trump's economic policy, and the president indicated on Friday that the White House has plenty of other options for imposing taxes on imported goods — some of which they are already dusting off.\n\n\"We have very powerful alternatives,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday as he bashed the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nHere's a rundown of options the Trump administration could turn to next, starting with a new 10% global tariff that the White House announced on Friday.\n\nTrump can use other laws to impose duties on goods from other countries, including Sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump mentioned all of these laws as viable alternatives to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the Supreme Court ruled was not intended for tariffs.\n\n\"Effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232, and existing Section 301 tariffs — they're existing, they're there — remain in place, fully in place, and in full force and effect,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added, \"Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.\"\n\nTrump also said his administration was \"initiating several Section 301, and other investigations, to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies.\"\n\nSection 301 allows the United States to place tariffs on goods from particular countries if they \"either violated international trade law or otherwise acted unfairly,\" according to Rachel Brewster, a professor of international trade at Duke Law School.\n\nIt's a \"broad standard\" that can work to Trump's benefit, Brewster said. And because the law includes provisions that allow the president to form trade deals with other countries to resolve the unfair trade practices, the deals Trump already struck after imposing IEEPA tariffs could likely be \"folded into\" Section 301, Brewster said.\n\nSection 232, on the other hand, allows the president to impose tariffs on particular goods they deem a national security threat, across all countries. Trump has already used the law broadly — he's applied it to everything from aluminum to bathroom vanities.\n\nSection 122 is a blunt instrument, allowing a blanket tariff of up to 15% on all imports from all countries for up to 150 days. The law is meant to address a \"balance of payments\" imbalance, and it's possible Trump could use it as a stopgap measure, according to Brewster.\n\nBefore Trump, no president tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs. The 1970s-era national security law says that, in case of emergencies, presidents can \"regulate\" importation.\n\nIt's the law he used to justify his April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of at least 10% on every country in the world, a 125% tariff on imports from China, and a tariff on any country that imported oil from Venezuela.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling released on Friday, the highest court in the land said that Trump overstepped his authority by using the IEEPA to impose taxes on imported goods.\n\n\"IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the ruling said.\n\nOne benefit of using Section 301 and Section 232 is that they have already proven legally durable.\n\nTrump used Section 301 in his trade war against China during his first term. Joe Biden, during his presidency, renewed the tariffs and expanded them by imposing additional duties on electric vehicles and solar panel components.\n\nImporters have challenged the tariffs brought under Section 301 and Section 232. So far, they haven't been successful, according to Kathleen Claussen, an international trade arbitrator and professor at Georgetown Law. Courts have ruled in favor of the government on all sorts of legal questions, from whether Trump had the power to bring the tariffs at all, to whether he followed the right process to add or modify particular products that were subject to tariffs.\n\n\"Big picture questions down to small, detailed nuances — those were all tested back in Trump One,\" Claussen told Business Insider.\n\nThe downside of both Section 301 and Section 232 is that each requires investigations from federal agencies to establish the tariffs, which can take months.\n\nA typical Section 301 United States Trade Representative investigation — to determine whether another country truly acted unfairly, and how high the duties should be in response — usually takes six months, Brewster said.\n\nBut the Trump administration can move quickly if it wants to, Claussen said. It can skip procedural steps, like convening a private sector committee or holding hearings.\n\n\"I do think people who think we're talking about, 'Oh, this is going to take a couple of months for them to stand up 301 — I don't think it will take that long,\" Claussen said.\n\nTrump could also dust off Section 338, a law passed during the Great Depression that has never been used to impose tariffs. The law allows duties of up to 50% for goods from specific countries that \"discriminate\" against US exports.\n\nThe law's language is broad and \"squishy,\" Claussen said, and it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. But it's possible the Trump administration would use it anyway.\n\n\"There's no question in my mind that the government is preparing all possible tools and options for the president,\" Claussen said. \"That's what you would imagine that they should be doing. So I would think that they are considering 338, I would think that they're considering 122 and just sort of teeing anything up so the president can choose what he thinks most appropriate.\"",

    "description": "A 6-3 majority struck down one of President Donald Trump's favored methods to impose tariffs.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump lashed out at the Supreme Court after justices dealt a sweeping rebuke of his trade policy.\n\nIn some of his harshest criticisms ever of the nation's highest court, Trump said some justices should be \"absolutely ashamed\" for siding against him. Without evidence, Trump accused justices of being \"swayed by foreign interests.\" He added that the majority opinion was \"almost like not written by smart people.\"\n\n\"Others think they're being politically correct, which has happened before far too often with members of this court,\" he said. \"They are just being fools and lapdogs for the RINOS and radical left Democrats.\"\n\nTrump said that it was fair to question the loyalty of \"our people,\" a likely reference to his two appointees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, who sided against the administration's view.\n\nTrump said that due to the \"deeply disappointing\" decision, \"alternatives\" will be used to preserve his trade agenda. Later, he said he would use a separate authority to impose a 10% global tariff on top of any existing tariffs.\n\n\"The Supreme Court did not overrule tariffs. They merely overruled a particular use of IEPPA tariffs,\" Trump said, citing the law in question in the court's ruling.\n\nA White House official later said that countries being tariffed under the authority the Supreme Court struck down will now be subject to the 10% tariff.\n\n\"With IEEPA no longer applicable, those countries will now be tariffed at the global 10% tariff using the Section 122 legal authority,\" the official said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This is, however, only temporary as the Administration will be pursuing other legal authorities to implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates.\"\n\nLeft unclear is what the administration will do in the long term.\n\nSection 122 tariffs, which Trump said he would use for a global tariff, can only be imposed for 150 days. After that, Congress must vote to extend. It's unclear if such a vote could pass just months before the midterm elections.\n\nAsked if the government will now have to issue refunds, Trump again criticized the court for not addressing the issue.\n\n\"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,\" he said.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump did not have the power under a 1970s law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs as he did in April 2025 during \"Liberation Day.\" The ruling does not invalidate all of Trump's tariffs, as other tariffs were imposed under different authorities. It does mean that Trump is significantly more limited in imposing broad, general tariffs against countries, one of his preferred methods in trade negotiations.\n\n\"The President must 'point to clear congressional authorization' to justify his extraordinary assertion to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"He cannot.\"\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly proclaimed himself to be \"Tariff Man,\" has also repeatedly suggested that he would use revenue from tariffs to pay for a range of things, from refund checks to paying down the national debt to helping fund childcare.\n\nIn total, Treasury Department data showed that the US has collected more than $133 billion in tariffs as of December.\n\nThe White House and top Trump administration officials have repeatedly suggested that if the court struck down most of Trump's tariffs that it would be a mess to sort out any potential refund process.\n\n\"It won't be a problem if we have to do it, but I can tell you that if it happens - which I don't think it's going to - it's just a corporate boondoggle,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently told Reuters. \"Costco, who's suing the US government, are they going to give the money back to their clients?\"\n\nRoberts' opinion did not explicitly address a potential refund process, a point that Justice Brett Kavanaugh seized on in his 63-page dissent.\n\n\"The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument.\"\n\nIn addition to criticizing the justices in the majority, Trump offered effusive praise for Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissenting opinion.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Trump said, suggesting Kavanaugh's stock has \"gone way up.\"\n\nThis is unlikely to be Trump's last word on the soon-to-be historic ruling. On Tuesday, he is set to deliver his annual State of the Union address.\n\nHistorically, the justices occupy front-row seats on the House floor.",

    "description": "Govs. Gavin Newsom and JB Pritzker demand Trump pay Americans $1,700 in tariff refunds after the Supreme Court ruling.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump previously promised Americans tariff dividend checks, but if Democrats have their way, he could be issuing refunds instead.\n\nAfter a Supreme Court ruling on Friday struck down Trump's tariffs levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Democratic lawmakers were quick to demand that the president repay Americans through tariff refunds.\n\n\"Donald Trump should return that money immediately. He has an obligation,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday. \"$1,751 per family that were taxed by Donald Trump. He took hundreds of billions of dollars from working folks, from the ag community, from small businesses for this vanity play, this illegal action, and he finally was held to account. The rule of law won out.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to Trump calling for refunds to families in his state.\n\n\"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enrage our allies, and sent grocery store prices through the roof,\" Pritzker said in the letter. \"On behalf of the people of Illinois, I demand a refund of $1,700 for every family in Illinois.\"\n\nThe governor also sent an invoice billing that amount for more than 5.1 million Illinois families, totaling more than $8.6 billion. The invoice said it was \"PAST DUE - DELINQUENT.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House spokesman Kush Desai responded in part by saying if Pritzker \"really cared about delivering economic relief for Illinois, he'd start with his own state government instead of chasing another stupid headline.\"\n\nThe offices of Newsom and Pritzker did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBoth Newsom and Pritzker are considered potential candidates for the presidential election in 2028, and they've both been highly critical of Trump.\n\nThe governors appeared to be basing their requests for refunds of that amount on a report released this month by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee in Congress. The report found American families paid an average of $1,745 in tariff costs between February 2025 and January 2026, for a total of over $231 billion paid by consumers.\n\nOther studies, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale, have found that tariff costs are largely paid by American businesses and consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday ruled that tariffs issued under the IEEPA, a national security act, had exceeded the president's authority. Trump denounced the decision and said he would pursue additional tariffs through other avenues.\n\nIn November, Trump touted the money being collected from tariffs and floated the idea of sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to middle and low-income Americans, though issuing such checks would likely have required an act of Congress. In January, Trump gave mixed messages about his plans for tariff rebate checks.\n\nNow, with the IEEPA tariffs struck down, it's likely some American businesses will try to receive refunds for the tariff costs they paid.\n\nDespite Democrats' stance on the issue, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or how refunds would happen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling did not touch on issuing tariff refunds.\n\nWhen Trump was asked Friday if the government would now have to issue refunds, he said, \"I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday it was \"unlikely\" Americans would receive tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said, adding, \"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years.\"",

The president has other avenues to impose tariffs, including through Section 232.\n\nWhile he criticized the justices who sided against him, Trump lavished praise on the three who dissented, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas.\n\n\"I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for, frankly, his genius and his great ability,\" Trump said.\n\nWedbush's Dan Ives said the ruling could be a \"net positive\" for tech companies if refunds are issued.\n\n\"With ~$133.5 billion in tariff revenue up for grabs if the US tariff ruling leads to refunds for organizations, we believe this would act as a net positive for tech with financial relief for many companies while creating greater supply chain visibility especially coming from the Asia supply chain,\" Ives wrote in a note. \"This will be a very noisy situation but for the tech space and AI trade it's a net positive out of the gates in our view.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts' ruling did not explicitly address what companies that paid the now-invalidated tariffs may be entitled to.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent lamented the ruling, adding that it was \"unlikely\" Americans will ever see tariff refunds.\n\n\"I got a feeling the American people won't see it,\" Bessent said during a speech before the Economic Club of Dallas.\n\nLike Trump, Bessent noted the administration has other alternatives to impose tariffs. He also echoed the president's point that it may take years to sort out any potential refunds.\n\n\"My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years,\" Bessent said about the coming court fights.\n\nJefferies analysts said five consumer stocks are poised to get a big boost on the heels of the ruling.\n\nThe firm's analysts said Signet Jewelers, Yeti, Sharkninja, Nike, and Birkenstock are all set to gain do to \"a meaningful margin tailwind.\"\n\nRaymond James Washington Policy Analyst Ed Mills said he expects any sort of refund process to be \"lengthy and challenging.\"\n\n\"We expect that the process for firms to receive tariff refunds will be lengthy and challenging, with litigants needing to bring individual cases or participate in class action (vs. automatic refunds),\" Mills wrote in a note.\n\nMills added that Costco and other firms have sued to ensure their claims are not invalidated by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's deadline for disputing tariff bills. Costco's case remains ongoing.\n\nFormer Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti said \"rational businesses\" should understand that tariffs aren't going away.\n\n\"The point is that any rational US business is going to anticipate the possibility of new tariffs, which is going to: (a) deter them from passing along any short-term cost savings to consumers; and (b) continue to fuel the uncertainty that is putting a damper on certain forms of business investment in the US,\" Ramamurti wrote in a post on Substack.\n\nThe short-term economic impact is unclear, Ramamurti wrote, because the court's opinion did not address major issues like potential refunds.\n\nOn the topic of refunds, Erica York, the vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said it should actually be quite easy for the Trump administration to issue refunds.\n\n\"The IEEPA tariffs have brought in around $160 billion in tariff payments. For context, the IRS refunds taxpayers more than $300 billion in income tax overpayments each year,\" York wrote on X. \"Refunding tariff payments to the importer of record should follow a similar, straightforward process.\"\n\nInvestor Jason Calacanis said the court's ruling shows why Trump needs to work with Congress to impose tariffs.\n\n\"MAGA and AFAO loyalists will lose their minds when President @AOC and VP @ZohranKMamdani start using 'emergency powers' to shape their socialist agenda,\" Calacanis wrote on X. \"This is why the Founding Fathers limited executive power and balanced the branches of government.\"\n\nWhile often supportive of Trump, Calacanis and others in the business and tech space have expressed skepticism of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and the National Retail Federation hailed the court's decision.\n\n\"Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year,\" Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.\n\nThe National Retail Federation called on a lower court \"to ensure a seamless process to refund the tariffs.\"\n\n\"The refunds will serve as an economic boost and allow companies to reinvest in their operations, their employees and their customers,\" David French, executive vice president of government relations, said in a statement.\n\nCanadian Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the decision \"strengthens\" his country's view that Trump's emergency tariffs were \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Although Canada has concluded the best trade agreement with the United States among all its trading partners, we recognize that there is still much to be done to support Canadian businesses and workers who continue to be affected by the tariffs imposed under Section 232 on the steel, aluminum, and automotive sectors,\" LeBlance wrote in a post on X.\n\nNotably, Section 232 tariffs are not included in Friday's ruling, underscoring that Trump still has additional tools at his disposal for his trade policy.\n\nVice President JD Vance called the decision \"lawlessness from the Court.\"\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries and supply chain resiliency.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Republicans would find a way forward after the setback.\n\n\"No one can deny that the President's use of tariffs has brought in billions of dollars and created immense leverage for America's trade strategy and for securing strong, reciprocal America-first trade agreements with countries that had been taking advantage of American workers for decades,\" Johnson said in a statement posted on X. \"Congress and the Administration will determine the best path forward in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a victory lap after the ruling.\n\n\"Donald Trump's failed economic policies and global trade war waged with irresponsible, on-again, off-again tariffs on our allies and trading partners have generated massive uncertainty, threatened the economic well-being of the American people and damaged our country's standing around the world,\" Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nThe Top House Democrat said his party will \"push back aggressively in Congress\" on Trump's tariffs.\n\nDespite being in the minority, all but one House Democrat recently joined with six Republicans to approve a largely symbolic rebuke of Trump's emergency tariffs on Canada. It was unclear if the resolution would have passed in the Senate. Trump was widely expected to veto it if it arrived on his desk.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump lacked the power to impose such tariffs on Canada.\n\nCorrection: February 20, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Hakeem Jeffries' name.",

    "fullText": "All truckers and bus drivers will have to take their commercial driver’s license tests in English as the Trump administration expands its aggressive campaign to improve safety in the industry and get unqualified drivers off the road.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the latest effort Friday to ensure that drivers meet the federal requirements to understand English well enough to read road signs and communicate with law enforcement officers. Florida already started administering its tests in English.\n\nCurrently, many states allow drivers to take their license tests in other languages even though they are required to demonstrate English proficiency. California offered tests in 20 other languages. Duffy said that a number of states have hired other companies to administer commercial driver's licenses tests, and those companies aren't enforcing the standards that drivers are supposed to meet to demonstrate their driving and English skills.\n\nThese latest enforcement efforts come just days after the Transportation Department said 557 driving schools should close because they failed to meet basic safety standards. The department has been aggressively going after states that handed out commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants who shouldn’t have qualified for them ever since a fatal crash in August.\n\nA truck driver who Duffy says wasn’t authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Other fatal crashes since then, including one in Indiana that killed four members of an Amish community earlier this month, have only heightened concerns.\n\nStates are expected to ensure drivers can speak English before giving them a commercial license, and then law enforcement is supposed to check driver's language skills during any traffic stops or inspections. Drivers who can't communicate effectively are supposed to be pulled off the road. A recent federal effort involving 8,215 inspections led to nearly 500 drivers being disqualified because of their English skills. California initially resisted enforcing the English rules, but the state recently pulled more than 600 drivers off the highways.\n\nDuffy said every American wants drivers who get behind the wheel of a big rig to be well-qualified to handle those vehicles. But he said that for too long the problems in the trucking industry were “allowed to rot and no one's paying attention to it for decades.\"\n\n“Once you start to pay attention, you see that all these bad things have been happening. And the consequence of that is that Americans get hurt,” Duffy said. “When we get on the road, we should expect that we should be safe. And that those who drive those 80,000-pound big rigs, that they are well-trained, they’re well-qualified, and they’re going to be safe.”\n\nThe campaign will also now expand to prevent fraudulent trucking companies from getting into the business while continuing to go after questionable schools and ensure states are complying with all the regulations for handing out commercial licenses.\n\nDuffy said that the registration system and requirements for trucking companies will be strengthened while Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration inspectors conduct more spot checks of trucks and commercial driver’s license schools.\n\nOfficials are also trying to make sure that the electronic logging devices drivers use are accurate, and that states are following all the regulations to ensure drivers are qualified to get commercial licenses.\n\nCurrently, companies only have to pay $300 and show proof of insurance to get registered to operate, and then they might not be audited until a year or more later. And even then the audits might be done virtually, which makes it less likely to identify fraudulent companies.\n\nThat has made it easy for fraudulent companies that are known in the industry as “chameleon carriers” to register multiple times under different names and then simply switch names and registration numbers to avoid any consequences after crashes or other violations.\n\nDan Horvath, who is the chief operating officer for the American Trucking Associations trade group, said this longstanding problem has made it far too easy for companies that have been ordered to shut down to just change their name and registration number and keep operating the same way.\n\n“What we think at ATA has happened over the years is that we have a lack of true enforcement and intervention with motor carriers that are in operation,” Horvath said. Only a small fraction of trucking companies ever undergo a full compliance review with an in-person inspection, he said.\n\nAfter that Indiana crash, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration knocked the company that employed the driver out of service and pulled the DOT numbers assigned to two other companies that were linked to AJ Partners. Tutash Express and Sam Express in the Chicago area were also disqualified, and the Aydana driving school that the trucker involved in the crash attended lost its certification.\n\nImmigration authorities arrested that driver because they said the 30-year-old from Kyrgyzstan entered the country illegally. Authorities say he pulled out and tried to go around a truck that had slowed in front of him, and his truck slammed into an oncoming van.\n\nIn December, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration took action to decertify up to 7,500 of the 16,000 schools nationwide, but that included many defunct operations.\n\nDuffy said the companies involved in that Indiana crash were all registered at the same apartment. In other cases, there might be hundreds of these chameleon companies registered at a single address.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",

    "description": "Major indexes rose on Friday, with investors looking past a weak GDP report after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's tariffs are illegal.",
    "fullText": "Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.\n\nUS stocks reversed earlier losses after the Supreme Court struck down the sweeping trade policy the president unveiled last April. The decision is a major update to an issue that's been a source of intense uncertainty and volatility for much of the last year, and will also raise new questions about how Trump might pursue his landmark policy push.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around noon ET on Friday:\n\nThe news on tariffs outweighed a disappointing update on economic growth, while PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, heated up faster than expected. GDP grew 1.4% year-over-year last quarter, falling far short of estimates, while PCE rose 0.4% in December, slightly above the anticipated 0.3% gain.\n\n\"The market just totally erupted,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider. \"In the short run, it's good for corporate earnings.\"\n\nHere are four big takeaways for investors.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Trump's ability to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that allows the president to regulate economic activity in emergency events.\n\nBut there are a handful of other legal avenues the president could use to try to impose tariffs again, according to Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The Trump administration can impose pretty much the equivalent levies if they so wish to, which you'd imagine they do,\" he told Business Insider, adding that his outlook on US trade policy hadn't changed significantly over the long term.\n\n\"The president has already signalled that he will quickly pivot to other legal tools to achieve similar trade restrictions, and he has at his disposal multiple levers to pull in order to circumvent the verdict,\" Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at Ebury, wrote on Friday, adding that Trump's longer-term strategy for tariffs was \"unlikely to be derailed.\"\n\n\"The ball is now in the administration's court—specifically the willingness and ability to impose tariffs under alternative legal authorities,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a top economist and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in a post on X.\n\nShould Trump impose new tariffs, it's likely that import duties will be lower due to the legal precedent set by the SCOTUS ruling, according to Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"In particular, it will be harder for the White House to impose tariffs without clear justification and due process. Businesses and consumers will get more clarity and lower rates going forward,\" Long wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nThe positive market reaction on Friday suggests that investors think tariff refunds are a possibility, according to Pepperstone's Brown.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, said he believed the US would likely issue between $100 billion and $130 billion in tariff refunds.\n\n\"When one thinks about the fiscal tailwind that may inject $100-150 billion in cash to American households this year in addition to tariff refunds we are talking real money,\" he wrote in a post on X, referring to the amount households are expected to get in tax refunds this year.\n\nIt's unclear how the refunds, if the US will issue any, will work, Long said.\n\n\"The refund process will be a mess,\" she wrote. \"It's likely the White House will fight against issuing refunds at all.\n\nBond yields ticked higher shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, a sign that concerns are beginning to swell over the US debt picture again, now that tariff revenue, for the moment, has been taken off the table.\n\n\"Tariffs had been functioning as a shadow tax that helped fund spending without explicitly raising taxes. Remove that and the deficit widens, borrowing rises, and historically that is the type of development that leans on the bond market and pressures yields higher,\" Mark Malek, the CIO of Siebert Financial, wrote in a note on Friday.",

The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "description": "President Trump was the first to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.\n\n“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision on Friday left uncertain the extent to which those who paid tariffs might be able to obtain refunds, with Justice Kavanaugh warning that any refund process could be a substantial “mess.”\n\nThe United States “may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid” the tariffs, he wrote, “even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.”\n\nThe court’s ruling, backed by justices from across the ideological spectrum, was a rare and significant example of the Supreme Court pushing back on Mr. Trump’s agenda. Since he returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority had overwhelmingly issued emergency orders allowing the president to carry out his policies on a temporary basis. But the decision on Friday will have a more lasting impact.\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees — Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Chief Justice Roberts and the three liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump called the Supreme Court’s ruling “a disgrace” while speaking to the nation’s governors on Friday, according to two people familiar with his comments.\n\nEarly last year, Mr. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations.\n\nA dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing.\n\nPratik Shah, the lead lawyer for the toy company, said in a statement that the justices had “upheld the foundational separation-of-powers principle that our small-business client has been fighting for: no president has boundless power to tax Americans.”\n\nIn court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has collected roughly $240 billion in tariff revenue since April 2, 2025 labeled “Liberation Day,” by President Trump. The research firm Capital Economics estimated that if the Treasury is forced to issue refunds, the cost would run to about $120 billion or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nBut even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law.\n\nMr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThe affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nDuring oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers.\n\nIn its 21-page opinion, the majority said it was telling that for half a century, no other president had invoked the statute to impose “any tariffs — let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.”\n\nThe two words “regulate” and “importation,” the court said, do not give the president the power to “impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.”\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the president’s use of the statute had run afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch. The court relied on the same doctrine to strike down President Joseph R. Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe three liberal justices agreed with the overall ruling, but insisted the same result could have been reached without applying the doctrine, which they have been critical of in the past.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a lengthy and forceful separate opinion agreeing that Mr. Trump had overstepped his authority and defending Congress as the proper branch to impose taxes.\n\n“Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” he wrote. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Kavanaugh said the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs and noted that they had helped the administration negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars.\n\nEven so, Justice Kavanaugh laid out other ways the president could set duties through different federal statutes.\n\n“So the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward,” he wrote. “But the court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.\n\nAbbie VanSickle Tyler Pager and @Patti Cohen contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "MAGA’s hate machine is—at least temporarily—sputtering.\n\nOn Monday, late-night host Stephen Colbert attempted to interview Texas Senate hopeful James Talarico. Instead of this being a routine nothing-to-write-home-about few minutes chat with a little-known Texas state representative, Colbert ran into a legal wall: CBS’s attorneys told the broadcaster to pull the interview after Trump’s FCC argued that late-night-show interviews of political candidates from one party but not the other violate federal regulations. The network allegedly advised the host that he shouldn’t even discuss on-air that it had put the kibosh on the interview.\n\nColbert wasn’t amused. Not only did he proceed to talk about it on the air; he interviewed Talarico and posted it on YouTube, where, within two days, the clip had garnered some 7.8 million views.\n\nA week ago, polls showed Representative Jasmine Crockett leading Talarico by eight points. If Talarico ends up winning his primary in Texas and then goes on to win the general election against the front-runner to be the GOP’s nominee, Texas’s far-right attorney general, Ken Paxton—who avoided a likely conviction for securities fraud two years ago by taking a plea bargain and agreeing to do community service—he will have Trump’s anti–First Amendment FCC to thank for his meteoric rise to national prominence.\n\nPolling conducted before the Colbert interview of a hypothetical Talarico-Paxton matchup shows the race to be a toss-up. And now CBS’s pandering to the Trump administration over the Colbert interview has given the Democrat a crucial publicity boost just as early voting in the March 3 primaries gets underway. Indeed, many of the more than 65,000 commenters on the YouTube video specifically thanked the FCC for bringing the interview, and the candidate, to their attention.\n\n“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights,” Talarico explained to Colbert, in reacting to the attempts to censor him. The audience roared its approval. For the next 14 minutes, Talarico hit rhetorical home run after home run, denouncing the hypocrisies of Christian Nationalism—“people baptizing their partisanship and calling that Christianity”—attacking the xenophobia of the MAGA movement, and explaining how the real fight in America is “not left versus right; it’s top versus bottom.” That’s as succinct a summary of the problem of oligarchy as any I have heard.\n\nOver the last few weeks, there has been something remarkably ham-handed and asinine about the authoritarianism that Trump 2.0 is serving up. The ambition remains. The administration is still trying to curtail free speech, chill political participation, and take over election processes in the run-up to the November vote, but some of the enthusiasm and efficiency of the administration that we saw last year seems to have at least temporarily dissipated.\n\nSince the Department of Homeland Security announced that the ICE surge in Minneapolis was ending, Stephen Miller, the most outspoken proponent of Trump’s might-is-right worldview, has been remarkably silent. Greg Bovino, the Gestapo-trenchcoat-wearing public face of ICE, has largely vanished from view. (Bovino was last seen with some drinking buddies being unceremoniously kicked out of a bar on the Las Vegas strip.)\n\nKristi Noem also went largely silent, though in her case she couldn’t quite go a whole week without doing something blitheringly stupid, entirely offensive, cruel, or patently unconstitutional. At a press conference, she announced that the blizzard of federal investigations into alleged voter fraud were intended to “make sure we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.” Someone apparently forgot to give her the memo that you don’t say the really undemocratic stuff out loud. And later in the week, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a memo announcing that refugees in the United States who hadn’t gotten their green card within one year of arrival would be subject to arrest and detention. As for Trump’s lapdog attorney general, Pam Bondi, after the debacle of her congressional hearing, she has apparently decided to hide under the tranche of Epstein documents that, drip by drip, leak by leak, are corroding what remains of the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n\nEven Trump’s social media presence has become tired and formulaic. When Winter Olympics athlete Hunter Hess said that representing Trump’s United States “brings up mixed emotions,” the narcissist in chief took time out from his busy day to post on Truth Social, “U.S. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn’t represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe post was so boring that Hess didn’t even mention Trump in his reply. “There is so much that is great about America, but there are always things that could be better,” the athlete wrote. “One of the many things that makes this country so amazing is that we have the right and the freedom to point that out.” Apparently, in between his training sessions on the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, Hess attended the high school civics lesson on the First Amendment that the Trump team all skipped out on.\n\nOf course, by next week the sundowning authoritarian may have pushed the United States into an avoidable forever war with the Iranians, and with the help of GOP governors in key states such as Texas and Florida, he may have escalated his efforts to sabotage the midterm elections. In fact, if I were a betting man, I’d say the odds were pretty high on both of those fronts. But given the horrors we are living through, I’ll take small graces where I can. For now, at least some of the air seems to have gone out of Trump—and when push comes to shove, a deflated, tired Trump, despite all the military hardware at his fingertips, is simply a nasty, trash-talking, increasingly addled old man.",

    "description": "In truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground.",
    "fullText": "To stay up to date with all Jurisprudence news, please \n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.\n\nIn truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nRoberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”\n\nCongress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.\n\nAnother clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.\n\nThere was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.\n\nShould we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.\n\nBut we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "description": "Hess found himself in the middle of a firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics after comments he made regarding representing the U.S. in the current political climate.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.\n\n\"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama \"gave classified information\" and wasn't \"supposed to be doing that,\" adding that he could get him \"out of trouble\" by declassifying the relevant files.\n\nObama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are \"real\" and that they're not \"being kept\" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens \"have made contact with us.\"\n\nAliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.\n\nOn the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nOne of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.\n\nBetting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.\n\nPolymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.\n\nIf the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.\n\nIn November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.\n\nThe mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.\n\nAt that time, Trump said the government \"knows what is happening\" but wasn't sharing it.\n\n\"For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Something strange is going on,\" he added.\n\nA Facebook group titled \"New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it\" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.",

    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.\n\nThe PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.\n\nThe investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.\n\nThe department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.\n\n“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.\n\nMany of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”\n\nThe PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.\n\n“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”\n\nThe group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.\n\nMIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.\n\nThe University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.\n\n“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.\n\nThe University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.\n\nOut of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.\n\nThe Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”\n\nThe administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A large banner featuring Donald Trump's face was hung on the exterior of Justice Department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the Republican president's efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.\n\nWhile Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department's tradition of independence from White House control.\n\nThe banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has postured herself as the president's chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nTrump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the Justice Department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.\n\nThe Justice Department in a statement Thursday said it is proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction.”\n\nThe Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president's perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.\n\nFederal prosecutors brought charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Comey said the banner was “sickening to see,” adding that the administration \"forgot to cover the inscription” on one side of the building that says, “Where law ends tyranny begins.\"\n\nThe department is also investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.",

    "title": "Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.",
    "description": "The consequences of this shift are not abstract.",
    "fullText": "During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.\n\nNow, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.\n\nBut now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.\n\nThis issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.\n\nI know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.\n\nThis is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.\n\nThe moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump appeared to be struggling to stay awake as others spoke at his inaugural meeting of the so-called “Board of Peace.”\n\nThe president, 79, rambled for more than 45 minutes before taking a seat on stage Thursday as others addressed the group gathered in Washington, DC.\n\nCameras repeatedly caught Trump with his eyes closed as the event dragged on.\n\nThe president’s eyelids appeared to grow heavy on Thursday as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was speaking, less than an hour after the president took his own seat following his address.\n\nAt one point as world leaders spoke, he jolted back into a straighter position when applause rang out, snapping his eyes open.\n\nIt’s the latest in a series of public gatherings where the oldest president ever elected appeared to nod off in front of the cameras.\n\nThe president has defended his moments of shuteye during his meetings after he was seen dozing off at roundtables and Cabinet meetings at the White House.\n\nDuring his most recent gathering of top officials late last month, the president insisted he did not sleep through his December Cabinet meeting but argued he only closed his eyes at the previous gathering because it got “pretty boring.”\n\n“It was a little bit at the boring side, but I didn’t sleep,” Trump claimed at the time.\n\nHe also claimed the cameras had simply captured him during a moment where he was blinking, but the explanation conflicted with the moments being captured on video.\n\nTrump’s habit of closing his eyes while meeting with top officials and world leaders—followed by social media posting rampages in the middle of the night—has raised questions about the 79-year-old’s cognitive decline and fitness in office.\n\nBesides jolting up at one point on Thursday as Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait spoke, the president also appeared to be slumped slightly to the side with his eyes closed as the king of Bahrain spoke.\n\nEven resting his eyes would have been strange behavior after the president declared his “Board of Peace” the “most consequential board.”\n\n“There’s never been anything close because these are the greatest world leaders,” Trump declared in his comments at the top of the event.\n\nAt the end of the three-hour event, the president remained seated as other world leaders gathered around him as he signed the fundraising pledges. Trump then handed off the documents to those next to him to hold up, and handed out pens as if he were participating in a bill-signing ceremony at the White House.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration has issued a sweeping new order that could lead to the arrest of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the United States but do not yet have permanent residency, overturning years of legal and immigration safeguards.\n\nA memo filed by the Department of Homeland Security ahead of a Thursday federal court hearing in Minnesota says refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. for review of their applications.\n\nDHS “may maintain custody for the duration of the inspection and examination process,” said the memo, which was filed Wednesday.\n\nAdvocacy and resettlement groups slammed the order, which will likely face legal challenges and could sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of immigration restrictions by the Trump administration, which has upended longstanding policies toward refugees, including dramatically reducing the number admitted into the country. A memo obtained by The Associated Press late last year said the administration was planning a review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, and immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who arrived during those years.\n\nThe administration has cited national security and economic concerns for its changed policies. Experts say refugees let into the country already undergo extensive vetting.\n\nThe new order came hours before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim heard arguments Thursday on whether he should extend a temporary order that protects Minnesota refugees lawfully in the U.S. from being arrested and deported. Tunheim’s order applies only in Minnesota, but the implications of the new national policy was a major part of the discussion anyway.\n\nHow many people could be arrested under the new order was unclear.\n\nJustice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during Thursday's hearing that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but indicated that would not always happen.\n\n“That's a discretion call for DHS to make,” he said, a comment met with skepticism by attorneys for the Minnesota refugees.\n\nTunheim did not rule Thursday, saying he’d issue a written decision on whether the temporary order would be extended.\n\nAfter the hearing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said at a news conference outside the courthouse that the government \"failed to offer any coherent argument for their policy in either law or fact.” She wasn’t in court for the hearing, but said she'd been briefed about it.\n\n“And so we will continue the fight for justice in the courts,” Smith said, flanked by attorneys and refugee rights supporters, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nImmigration advocates quickly pushed back against the new policy, with HIAS, an international Jewish nonprofit serving refugees and asylum-seekers, calling it “a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed.”\n\n“They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention,\" Beth Oppenheim, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nTunheim blocked the government from targeting the Minnesota refugees last month, saying the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claims “that their arrest and detention, and the policy that purports to justify them, are unlawful.” His Jan. 28 temporary restraining order will expire Feb. 25 unless he grants a more permanent preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge previously rejected the government’s claim that it had the legal right to arrest and detain refugees who haven’t obtained their green cards within a year of arriving in the U.S.\n\n“Mandating detention would lead to an illogical result,” Tunheim wrote, since refugees can’t even apply for green cards until they’ve been in the U.S. for a year. The government's interpretation, he said, means nearly all refugees would face detention unless immigration officials conducted their review at exactly the one-year mark, which he called “nonsensical.”\n\nRefugee rights groups sued the federal government in January after the government launched Operation PARRIS, an acronym for Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening.\n\nIt was billed as a “sweeping initiative” to reexamine the cases of 5,600 Minnesota refugees who had not yet been granted permanent resident status, or green cards. The agencies cited fraud in public programs in Minnesota as justification.\n\nOperation PARRIS was part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targeting Minnesota, including a surge of thousands of federal officers. Homeland Security called it the largest immigration enforcement operation ever. It sparked mass protests after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens. White House border czar Tom Homan announced last week the surge was ending, though a small federal presence would remain.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE officers went door to door under Operation PARRIS arresting refugees and sending them to detention centers in Texas, without access to attorneys. Some were later released in Texas and left to find their own way back to Minnesota, they said.\n\nTunheim noted in his order that refugees are extensively vetted by multiple agencies before being resettled in the U.S. He wrote that none arrested in the operation had been deemed a danger to the community or a flight risk, nor had any been charged with crimes that could be grounds for deportation.\n\nTunheim stressed that the refugees impacted by his order were admitted into the U.S. because of persecution in their home countries. He prohibited further arrests under Operation PARRIS and ordered that detainees still in custody from it be released and returned to Minnesota.\n\n“They are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border. Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s top aides have warned his administration to stay on message as the midterm elections approach in a bid to counter the president’s unpredictable behavior and tendency to go wildly off-script.\n\nAt a strategy session for dozens of administration officials on Tuesday night, the president’s inner circle also acknowledged that affordability would remain a major issue for voters, especially if they didn’t feel the gains Trump often talks about.\n\nThe meeting, on Capitol Hill, was hosted by White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, with presentations by her deputy, James Blair, and GOP veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio.\n\nAnd while Trump was not in the room, his longstanding concern—that it is rare for the president’s party to win in midterm elections—was front and center, according to sources.\n\nDuring the two-hour session, Blair, a 36-year-old former political consultant, presented historical trends to this effect.\n\nHe also acknowledged that Trump could be unpredictable and was likely to say and do as he pleased, without necessarily focusing on data. Therefore, he said, it was crucial for everyone else to remain on message, disciplined, and data-driven as the campaign ramped up.\n\nHe also suggested that there was no point in talking about wages going up (something that Trump cites regularly) unless voters feel the impacts of the administration’s economic achievements.\n\nA similar challenge confronted former President Joe Biden, who repeatedly touted the value of so-called “Bidenomics”—even as millions of Americans struggled with cost-of-living pressures.\n\nThe session, which took place at Washington’s Capitol Hill Club, was attended by dozens of administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nThey were told that they would be required to be more active as surrogates for the midterms, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, along with a third of the seats in the 100-member Senate.\n\nLosing in November could ultimately dent Trump’s legislative agenda for the next two years and result in articles of impeachment against him and members of his Cabinet.\n\nWhile Trump is not on the ballot for the midterms, Wiles revealed last year that the White House had shifted its strategy and would make him “campaign like it’s 2024” in the hope that more voters would turn out for the GOP.\n\n“Typically in the midterms, it’s not about who’s sitting at the White House—you localize the election, and you keep the federal officials out of it,” she told conservative group Moms of America.\n\n“We’re actually going to turn that on its head and put him on the ballot because so many of those low propensity voters are Trump voters.”\n\nBut the president faces a number of headwinds ahead of November, from sinking approval ratings and a fracturing MAGA base, as well as firestorms on everything from the Epstein files to ICE and immigration.\n\nHis bombastic tendency to go wildly off-script is also an issue, such as describing affordability as a “con job” or claiming that the Epstein files are a Democratic “hoax”.\n\nFabrizio took the group through a series of data outlining the issues that matter to voters in targeted seats, with the economy being the top-tier issue, which he said resonated more than border security.\n\nHe also suggested focusing more on podcasts and social media, rather than traditional interviews and news outlets, to get the message out.\n\nBut whether a more disciplined approach will be enough to counter the president’s unpredictability is yet to be seen, according to some Republicans.\n\n“If they stay on message, it’s a good thing,” said Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon. “They get sidetracked… they’ve got to stay focused.”\n\nCritics have also accused Trump of “gaslighting” Americans by trying to spotlight affordability and drug prices on the campaign trail.\n\n“Trump running on affordability is laughable,” said Protect Our Care president Brad Woodhouse.\n\n“Republican policies have only made life more expensive for hard-working families, and nothing has made that more clear than the GOP’s catastrophic cuts to health care.”",

    "fullText": "Late last year, as a US government shutdown cut off the Snap benefits that low-income families rely on for groceries, videos on social media cast the fallout in frantic scenes. “Imma keep it real with you,” a Black woman said in a viral TikTok post, “I get over $2,500 a month in stamps. I sell ’em, $2,000 worth, for about $1,200-$1,500 cash.” Another Black woman ranted about taxpayers’ responsibility to her seven children with seven men, and yet another melted down after her food stamps were rejected at a corn-dog counter.\n\nVisible watermarks stamped some videos as AI-generated – apparently, too faintly for the racist commentators and hustlers more than happy to believe the frenzy was real. “You got people treating it like a side hustle, selling the stamps, abusing the system,” the conservative commentator Amir Odom whinged. Fox News reported on the Snap deepfakes as if they were authentic, before issuing a correction. Newsmax anchor Rob Schmitt claimed people were using Snap “to get their nails done, to get their weaves and hair”. (Lost in the outrage was a basic fact: white Americans make up 37% of Snap’s 42 million beneficiaries.)\n\nThe fake videos are mere shards in the widening mosaic of digital blackface, a pattern that’s spiked in the past two years as generative AI video tools have become widely accessible. “There’s been a massive acceleration,” says Safiya Umoja Noble, a UCLA gender studies professor and author of Algorithms of Oppression, which focuses on digital biases against Black women in particular. “The digital blackface videos are really pulling from the same racist and sexist stereotypes and tropes that have been used for centuries.” The net effect is a patina of Blackness stripped of cultural obligation or stewardship – minstrelsy in a nutshell.\n\nCoined in a 2006 academic paper, the term digital blackface describes a form of Black cultural commodification repurposed for non-Black expression online. Examples run the gamut: posts in African American Vernacular English, the use of darker-skinned emojis, reaction memes featuring Beyoncé, Katt Williams and other exemplars of Black cool.\n\n“The early research that was done on digital blackface started with white gamers using bitmojis of a different race and changing their vernacular to represent themselves,” says Mia Moody, a Baylor University journalism professor whose forthcoming book, Blackface Memes, links the role of Black users in starting and spreading online trends to subsequent digital blackface. “That’s part of the cultural appropriation, gaining the cultural capital. Maybe you’re a nerdy white guy, but if you use this cool avatar of a Black guy with dreadlocks, people will give you respect. You’re interesting all of a sudden.”\n\nDuring memeology’s expansion into short-form video, Black expression has increasingly been divorced from authorship, context or consequence. Internet culture scholars say some non-white online creators use AI-generated avatars modeled on familiar Black faces – the beauty influencer, the culture podcaster, the man-on-the-street interviewer; they slip into feeds alongside real Black content creators. Large language models scour digital spaces that gained cachet from Black speech and humor, absorbing their tone and slang. Hume AI is one of many firms that offer synthetic voices for podcasts and audiobooks such as “Black woman with subtle Louisiana accent”, or “middle-aged African American man with a tone of hard-earned wisdom”. In most cases, creators whose speech is scraped from YouTube, podcasts and social media receive no compensation, much less even know their personalities shaped these models.\n\nThe Snap reaction clips, however, were a notable escalation in the mainstreaming of digital blackface – less blending in, more weapons-grade stereotyping. Many of those videos were created with OpenAI’s text-to-video app Sora. As Sora’s popularity surged in 2025, users exploited its hyperrealism to sully Martin Luther King Jr’s image, sparking ethical debate around “synthetic resurrection”. Deepfakes showed him shoplifting, wrestling Malcolm X, and swearing through his I Have a Dream speech. Conservative influencers swamped feeds with AI-generated embraces between King and Charlie Kirk, conflating their clashing legacies and cultural martyrdom. Bernice King, MLK’s daughter and the director of his Atlanta-based non-profit, criticized the slopaganda as “foolishness”.\n\nInevitably the Trump White House has gotten into the act. In January the official White House X account posted a doctored photo of Minnesota activist Nekima Levy Armstrong, darkened and weeping, in the wake of her arrest at a non-violent anti-ICE demonstration. Earlier this month an image portraying the Obamas as apes was circulated via Trump’s own Truth Social account.\n\nBlackface abides at the underbelly of American mass media even as it evolves at breakneck pace. Its roots trace to the minstrel revues of the early 19th century; white performers smeared grease paint made from charred corks on their faces and plastered on oversized white lips to caricature Black features, and performed exaggerated routines of Black laziness, buffoonery and hypersexuality. Thomas D Rice, a Manhattan playwright, shot to fame in the 1830s playing a loping trickster named Jim Crow – a name that quickly became shorthand for the forced racial segregation policies in the American south that endured until the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIn their heyday, minstrel shows were the dominant form of American entertainment – reflected in newspaper cartoons and the enormously popular Amos ‘n’ Andy radio shows. After the civil war, Black performers were largely forced into adopting minstrel elements, at the expense of their personhood once more, just to gain any footing on stage. “The objectives were, first, to make money to help educate our younger ones, and second, to try to break down the ill feeling that existed toward the colored people,” explained Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville minstrel and actor for almost 70 years who died in 1954.\n\nEven as minstrelsy faded from the spotlight by the early 20th century, its toxic residue lingered in American culture – from the shuffling crows of Disney’s Dumbo, to Ted Danson’s infamous 1993 blackface roast of Whoopi Goldberg, to the annual parade of white Halloween revelers in racial masquerade. A decade ago, when the internet was still a black box of sorts, researchers such as Noble and MIT’s Joy Buolamwini were sounding the alarm about the inherent racial biases in the coding of algorithms related to medical treatment, loan applications, hiring decisions and facial recognition. Now it’s out in the open, smearing wider and deeper than any burnt cork routine ever could.\n\nTech firms have made some effort to stem the tide of digital blackface. Bowing to public backlash, the King family and more prominent estates, OpenAI, Google and the AI image generator Midjourney disallowed deepfakes of King and other American icons. In January 2025, Meta deleted two of its own AI blackface characters – a retiree called Grandpa Brian and Liv, described as a “proud Black queer momma” and “truth-teller” – after allegations of their non-diverse development team fueled a tempest of criticism. Instagram and TikTok and more have made some attempts to scrub viral digital blackface videos, to tepid results. Last summer, efforts to replicate Bigfoot Baddie – the AI avatar of a Black woman as a human-yeti hybrid in pink wigs, acrylic nails and hair bonnets, created by Google’s Veo AI – erupted into a full-blown social media craze, with some users even hustling how-to courses. The avatar is still on socials.\n\nBlack in AI and the Distributed AI Research Institute (Dair) are among the handful of affinity groups that have pushed for diversity and community input in AI model-building to address programming bias. The AI Now Institute and Partnership on AI have highlighted the risks of AI systems learning from marginalized communities’ data and noted that tech companies could provide mechanisms such as data opt-outs to help limit harmful or exploitative uses. But widespread adoption has been glacial.\n\n“YouTube alone has something like 400 hours of content per minute being uploaded,” Noble says. “With AI generation, these tech firms cannot manage what’s coming through their systems. So they don’t. Or they do what’s absolutely imperative to the US government. But if you have an authoritarian regime in power, they can use your systems to facilitate propaganda.”\n\nAlthough the precise impact of AI-generated digital blackface is difficult to quantify, its use by the Trump administration highlights its potential as a powerful tool of official disinformation. The Obama Truth Social entry revived a slur that has festered for years in darker online corners, and one that rhymes with Trump’s sustained efforts to denigrate the former first family. (Trump disclaimed direct responsibility and refused to apologize for that post, which was taken down.) Meanwhile, the White House’s doctored image of Armstrong, altered from an actual photo taken by the Department of Homeland Security and published on their official Twitter account, scanned as a psyop by a government working closely with tech firms to track activists and other perceived enemies of the state.\n\nBeyond laundering bigotry as news, digital blackface exposes Black users to a level of personalized abuse and harassment that harkens to a minstrelsy heyday when racists were fully empowered to express their bigotry unbidden. And then just as now, it seems there is little that can be done to curb the vitriol. “We are living in a United States with an open, no-holds-barred, anti-civil-rights, anti-immigrant, anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-poor-policy agenda,” Noble says. “Finding the material to support this position is just a matter of the state bending reality to fit its imperatives. And that’s easily done when every tech company lines up behind the White House.”\n\nEven so, Moody remains hopeful that the current fascination with digital blackface will soon be as outdated and uninviting as the analog variant. She has seen this play before, after all. “Right now people are just experimenting with AI technology and having a ball seeing what they can get away with,” she says. “Once we get beyond that, then we’re going to see less of it. They’ll move on to something else. Or they’ll be up for a job, and it’ll be embarrassing. Just look at the history.”",

    "fullText": "Canadian travellers are still unhappy with President Donald Trump, and that's affecting the 2026 outlook of visitors to the US from Canada.\n\nIn 2025, there was a noticeable travel chill from the US's northern neighbor, following President Donald Trump's quips about the \"51st state\" and the levying of hefty tariffs.\n\nA January survey of more than 1,000 Canadian prospective travelers found that they remain hesitant to travel to the US and would rather support domestic tourism, according to Longwoods International, a tourism industry market research company.\n\nAccording to Longwoods International, 55% of surveyed Canadian travelers report that they intend to travel to the US within the next 12 months, which remains mostly unchanged from 54% reported in October 2025. Among those who intend to make the trip, only 9% say they have already made bookings.\n\nIn 2025, 4 million fewer Canadian travelers visited the US than the previous year, marking a 22% drop, according to the US Commerce Department's National Travel and Tourism Office.\n\nSeventy-three percent of Canadian respondents to the latest survey, who said they changed their 2026 travel plans to avoid the US, cited economic policies and tariffs.\n\nOther factors are also at work. More than 40% of respondents told Longwoods International that they strongly or somewhat disagree that the US is a place that values international travelers, welcomes travelers with diverse backgrounds, is a safe place to visit, and feels welcoming in general, and the number of Canadians who agree that the US feels safe to visit has been declining over the past year.\n\nPopular destinations for Canadian snowbirds, such as southern California and Florida, have been trying to woo them back. But it appears that those attempts have fallen flat as Trump continues to threaten Canada with tariffs and recently threatened to delay the opening of a bridge Canada paid for.\n\nIn 2025, California's Gov. Gavin Newsom began trying to convince Canadians with targeted video campaigns that California welcomes them. Recently, heart-shaped banners featuring the Canadian flag also popped up in Palm Springs, which, according to the Los Angeles Times, is feeling a chill this winter from fewer Canadian tourists.\n\n\"Sure, you-know-who is trying to stir things up back in DC, but don't let that ruin your beach plans,\" Newsom said in a campaign video. \"California is the ultimate playground — over 2,000 miles from Washington and a world away in mindset.\"\n\nAccording to Visit California, the number of Canadian visitors to the state still fell by over 18% in 2025 compared to the year prior, slipping to 1.4 million. In 2024, Visit California showed that 1.7 million Canadians visited the state and spent around $3.7 billion.\n\nEven Disney, the happiest place on earth, is feeling the impact as international travelers skip the US. In the Walt Disney Company's first-quarter earnings report earlier in February, the company said it is facing \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks, including Disney World in Florida and Disneyland in California.\n\nVisit Florida lists Canada as the state's top source of international visitors, with around 3.4 million travelers from Canada to the state in 2024. In 2025, the state saw a 15% year-over-year drop, according to Visit Florida, with only 2.9 million visitors from Canada.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet are also suspending all or some flights from Canada to the US this summer.\n\n\"We saw a notable decline in transborder travel demand throughout 2025,\" Julia Kaiser, media relations advisor for WestJet, told Global News earlier in February. \"As a result, we made timely decisions to modify our network to stay aligned with where Canadians want to go.\"\n\nThe slowdown in trips to the US doesn't mean that Canadians are no longer traveling. Longwoods International said that 45% of Canadian travelers who changed their plans for a US trip now say they would substitute it with a domestic trip, while about a quarter of prospective travelers are looking toward Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nAs of February 17, China also opened up visa-free entry for all Canadian citizens, allowing up to 30 days of travel for business, tourism, family visits, or transit.",

    "fullText": "CNN’s studio mic caught an anchor’s unvarnished reaction to an aside from President Donald Trump that involved his lack of affection for “handsome men.”\n\nTrump gave a speech Thursday morning at an event promoting his Board of Peace at the contentiously renamed “Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace.”\n\nAccording to pool reports, there were pro-Palestinian protesters across the street from the building “with big signs yelling ‘Donald Trump go to hell.’”\n\nThe president’s speech featured the usual stylistic flourishes and characteristic deviations — including one aside that caught CNN anchor Sara Sidner off guard.\n\nSidner and co-anchors John Berman and Kate Bolduan covered the speech live on Thursday’s edition of CNN News Central, during which the network cut in midway through Trump’s remarks.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He’s a great guy. They’re all great. But I was very proud of it.\n\nPresident Penna (Peña) of Paraguay is here. President. President, thank you very much.\n\nYoung, handsome guy. It’s always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you.\n\nI don’t like young, handsome men.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Women, I like. Men, I don’t have any interest.\n\nCNN ANCHOR JOHN BERMAN: Right. President Trump is speaking to his Board of Peace. This is the organization he founded first to help rebuild Gaza.\n\nTrump riffed freely as he introduced the other leaders at the event, as well.\n\nElsewhere in the speech, Trump appeared to try and assuage concerns about his entity being at odds with the United Nations, claiming his goal was to “strengthen up” the UN:\n\nThe Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly. But we’re going to strengthen up the United Nations. We’re going to make sure it’s facilities are good if they need help, and they need help, money wise, we can help them money wise. And we’re going to make sure the United Nations is viable.\n\nWatch above via CNN News Central.\n\nThe post Hot Mic Catches CNN Anchor’s Stunned Reaction to Trump Blurting He Doesn’t ‘Like Handsome Men’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Trump's plan to 'deprioritize' student-loan oversight has lawmakers worried about how your servicer is performing",
    "description": "After the major student-loan companies declined to release their own performance data, Sen. Elizabeth Warren requested information from the Ed. Dept.",
    "fullText": "Curious how your student-loan servicer is performing? You might be out of luck — for now.\n\nWhen asked by Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren for data on their performances, the major student-loan servicers delivered nearly identical responses — exclusively reviewed by Business Insider — that referred the lawmaker back to the Department of Education's Federal Student Aid office.\n\nOne servicer, MOHELA, wrote in a January 5 email to Warren that it has \"a formal statement that FSA has requested we send.\"\n\nThe statement, which the other servicers also sent, stated: \"Because your letter requests information and data maintained by the Department's office of Federal Student Aid, we respectfully ask that the request be redirected to the Department via the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs.\"\n\nMonitoring student-loan servicers' performance will become more critical this year as the Department of Education begins implementing its repayment changes that President Donald Trump signed into law in his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It will also prove more difficult after the Trump administration slashed staff at the consumer watchdog that played a large role in doing so.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers have expressed confusion about the changes, and lawmakers and policy experts have previously stressed the importance of ensuring that servicers are equipped to effectively implement new repayment plans, borrowing caps, and other reforms.\n\nIn response to a prior information request from Warren, Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent wrote in a letter in September 2025 that \"FSA is prioritizing efforts to improve customer service to student and parent borrowers,\" and did not comment on formally releasing performance metrics.\n\nThe last comprehensive report on servicer performance and borrower data posted on FSA's website covered the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Past reports have included customer satisfaction scores, average speed to answer calls, and data on the servicers' portfolios. Warren and Sen. Jeff Merkley wrote in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon that, following the servicers' responses, they are requesting that the Department of Education publish servicer performance data and make it available to the public.\n\n\"ED has repeatedly refused to comply with Congressional requests for basic servicer performance data and now appears to be refusing to allow federal student loan servicers to provide this information, despite previous Administrations granting such requests,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWarren and Merkley requested that the Department of Education provide data on a range of topics, including call center performance, customer service staff levels, and communication efforts to borrowers in delinquency and default.\n\nOversight over the industry has declined due to the Trump administration's gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that Warren helped create. The CFPB's chief legal officer directed the agency's employees in an April 2025 memo to \"deprioritize\" student-loan oversight, saying that the goal was to shift oversight responsibility to the states.\n\nAdditionally, Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues released a new report in early February detailing how private lenders are preparing for an influx of federal borrowers due to the new borrowing caps set to go into effect this summer. They wrote that their findings \"underscore an urgent need for oversight of the private lending market as these companies prepare to cash in on the Administration's agenda.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is trying to chip away at the integrity of the voting process ahead of the November midterms because he knows Republicans will not fare well, Daily Beast columnist David Rothkopf says.\n\nRothkopf told The Daily Beast Podcast that the Trump administration’s actions and the president’s words should be taken “very seriously.”\n\n“The reality is that they realize they’re going to lose, and so they are using every conceivable tool in order to put their thumb on the scale, right?” Rothkopf told host Joanna Coles.\n\nRothkopf gave two examples: the FBI’s controversial raid of a Fulton County, Georgia, election office for 2020 voter rolls and other materials, and Attorney General Pam Bondi offering to scale back Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minneapolis only if Governor Tim Walz provided voters’ unredacted personal data.\n\n“Why do they want the voter rolls? So they can disqualify people. Why do they want to pursue the conspiracy theories about Fulton County? So they can say, ‘Well, we need to impound these machines. There’s a potential problem’,” he said. “You will never see the votes again. You will never see what comes out of that.”\n\nRothkopf also cited the GOP-favoring redistricting effort that Texas began, and which other red-leaning states like Florida, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina followed. He also mentioned the SAVE America Act. That legislation, which has passed the House, would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote and government-issued photo ID to vote in federal elections. It would also limit mail-in voting and end ballot harvesting. Critics have argued that eligible voters without passports or birth certificates would be disenfranchised.\n\nAdditionally, Trump’s Department of Justice has been seeking unredacted copies of voter registration databases, with critics arguing this is a federal intrusion into state matters.\n\nComments by Trump are also cause for alarm. The president has not only called on Republicans to “nationalize the voting,” but has also floated canceling the midterms.\n\nMAGA stalwart Steve Bannon has said Trump is bent on proving that the 2020 election was stolen from him in order to then prevent Democratic wins in 2026 and 2028.\n\nIf any of Trump’s actions targeting the 2026 midterms end up being prosecutable, and if Republicans can “put their thumb on the scale” again in 2028, Rothkopf said, Trump will support a successor who will “cover his a--.” In that case, the ticket would be Bondi and Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nBondi “has completely debased herself—taken the entire Department of Justice, turned it into a Department of Obstruction of Justice and Retribution,” Rothkopf said. “And in [Trump’s] book, that’s a winner.”\n\nIn a statement to the Daily Beast, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson repeated the administration’s line that “anything said on the Daily Beast podcast is equivalent to screaming into the void. No one listens to this Trump Derangement Syndrome therapy session.”\n\nTrump “is committed to ensuring that Americans have full confidence in the administration of elections, and that includes totally accurate and up-to-date voter rolls free of errors and unlawfully registered non-citizen voters,” Jackson added. “The President has also urged Congress to pass the SAVE Act and other legislative proposals that would establish a uniform standard of photo ID for voting, prohibit no-excuse mail-in voting, and end the practice of ballot harvesting to ensure the safety and security of our elections.”\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

    "description": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was stunned when CBS reporter Ed O'Keefe asked for examples of President Trump being \"falsely called racist\"",
    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was visibly stunned after CBS’s Ed O’Keefe asked for examples of President Donald Trump being “falsely called racist” in recent years.\n\n“You’re kidding, right?” replied Leavitt during a White House press briefing on Wednesday.\n\nShe was responding to O’Keefe’s question, which quoted Trump’s tribute to Jesse Jackson a day earlier.\n\nIn his statement about Jesse Jackson, the president said “Despite the fact that I am falsely inconsistently called a racist by the scoundrels and lunatics on the radical left, Democrats all, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.” Where or when does the president believe he has been falsely called racist?\n\nThat spurred Leavitt’s shocked response and led to a few audible chuckles in the briefing room.\n\n“I will pull you plethora of examples. I’m going to get my team in that room to start going through the internet of radical Democrats throughout the years who have accused this president falsely of being a racist,” Leavitt said.\n\nShe continued, “And I’m sure there’s many people in this room and on network television across the country who have accused him of the same. In fact, I know that because I’ve seen it with my own eyes.”\n\nLeavitt added that Trump was looking forward to a Black History Month event scheduled for later in the day.\n\n“There is a lot this president has done for all Americans, regardless of race,” she said. “And he has absolutely been falsely called and smeared as a racist, and I’m happy to provide you those receipts.”\n\nTrump’s racial attitudes have long been called out by high-profile media personalities. Ex-CNN star Don Lemon branded Trump a “racist” in 2018, and called him a “racist piece of sh*t” last year. Another CNN alum, Jim Acosta, said in 2018 “this president deep down may just be a racist.” MS NOW anchor Lawrence O’Donnell dubbed Trump the “most racist” president who never owned slaves in 2024, and his colleague, Chris Hayes, called Trump “to his bones a racist” after he posted a video depicting ex-President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes earlier this month.\n\nOther examples include NBC White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor accusing Trump of using a “racist term” when he called COVID-19 the “kung-flu,” CBS reporter Weijia Jiang similarly said Trump used “racist phrases” during the pandemic, and Geraldo Rivera — a former longtime friend of the president’s — referring to Trump’s crackdown on migrants as “racist government policy.”\n\nAnd soon after the press briefing wrapped up, one of the White House’s X accounts posted an example of O’Keefe himself calling out Trump for “racist tweets” in 2019:\n\nThis reporter literally called President Trump's tweets racist in 2019. https://t.co/HlgnNg9DZA pic.twitter.com/Crjf26Qttj\n\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) February 18, 2026\n\nThe post ‘You’re Kidding, Right?’ Karoline Leavitt Gobsmacked After Reporter Asks for Examples of Trump Being ‘Falsely Called Racist’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested",
    "fullText": "Feb 18 (Reuters) - A federal judge threw out on Wednesday an administrative board's decision endorsing the Trump administration's policy of subjecting thousands of people arrested during its immigration crackdown to mandatory detention.\n\nU.S. District ‌Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, vacated the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals after finding the ‌administration had failed to comply with her earlier order declaring unlawful the underlying policy of denying detainees the chance to seek release on bond.\n\nSykes' Wednesday ruling, ​in a class action lawsuit that covers migrants nationwide, is more sweeping than decisions by hundreds of other U.S. judges holding the policy is unlawful and ordering detainees to be freed or given bond hearings.\n\nSykes, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, called the administration's actions \"shameless\" and accused it of trying to continue its \"campaign of illegal action\" by still refusing bond hearings despite her prior ruling.\n\n\"Respondents ‌have far crossed the boundaries of constitutional ⁠conduct,\" Sykes wrote.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSykes' ruling means the board's decision can ⁠no longer be used by immigration judges to deny bond hearings, said Niels Frenzen, a professor at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law who represented the plaintiffs.\n\n\"We hope that DHS and the immigration courts will now comply with the court's orders to ​provide ​bond hearings to the thousands of noncitizens who have been arrested,\" he ​said in a statement.\n\nFederal immigration law prescribes mandatory ‌detention for \"applicants for admission\" to the United States, while their cases proceed in immigration courts and they are ineligible for bond hearings.\n\nBucking a long-standing interpretation of the law, the DHS last year - as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown - took the position that non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision ‌in September that adopted that interpretation, leading to immigration judges nationally employed ​by the department to mandate detention.\n\nSykes in a ruling in December declared ​the DHS policy unlawful but stopped short of vacating ​the board's decision.\n\nBut she said it was clear further relief was needed after Chief Immigration Judge Teresa ‌Riley issued guidance instructing her colleagues that they ​are not bound by Sykes' ruling ​and that they should continue following the board's decision.\n\nThose immigration judges are employed by the Justice Department.\n\nSykes, in Wednesday's decision, criticized DHS for repeatedly and inaccurately suggesting that operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were limited to targeting ​criminal non-citizens who were the \"worst of the ‌worst.\"\n\n\"Maybe that phrase merely mirrors the severity and ill-natured conduct by the government,\" Sykes wrote. \"Even though these press ​releases might contain an inkling of truth, they ignore a greater, more dire reality.\"",

    "title": "Trump's top economic advisor says Fed researchers should be punished for their recent views on tariffs",
    "description": "Kevin Hassett said Fed researchers should be disciplined for their views on tariffs, sparking fresh concern from commentators about Fed independence.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump's economic advisor said that Federal Reserve writers behind a report claiming that Americans bear the brunt of tariffs should be \"disciplined.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, criticized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's economic analysis of the impact of tariffs published last week, calling for the authors to be punished for their findings.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment. It's, I think, the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined because what they've done is put out a conclusion which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first semester econ class,\" Hassett told CNBC.\n\nThe economists found that 90% of the economic burden of higher tariffs fell on US firms and consumers. The average tariff rate climbed to 13% from 2.6% in 2025 as part of Trump's sweeping trade policy unveiled last April.\n\n\"While importers pay the duty, the 'economic burden' of the tariff can be shifted onto exporters if they lower their export prices,\" the report reads. \"There is 100 percent pass-through from tariffs to import prices, and therefore on U.S. consumers and firms,\" the economists explained in the write.\n\nHassett defended the tariffs in his comments to CNBC.\n\n\"The basic theory of President Trump's tariffs is that, sure we're importing stuff from China, but we've got producers in the US that make the same stuff, maybe at a slightly higher price. If we bring the stuff home, create the demand at home, then that will hurt China and drive up wages in the US and American consumers be better off.\"\n\nHassett's remarks come as Fed independence is in focus. The Trump administration is in the midst of criminal investigations into Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Fed governor Lisa Cook.\n\nClaudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is known for creating the Sahm rule, a popular recession indicator, said the comments, specifically Hassett calling for the paper's authors to be disciplined, are \"deeply disturbing.\"\n\nShe added that Kevin Warsh, Trump's nominee to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair, \"must\" be asked about Hassett's comments at his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"The Fed Chair has the ability to suppress research from the Fed. Will he if it disagrees with White House?\" Sahm wrote.\n\nSteve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider that Hassett's comments are \"distressing.\"\n\n\"At best it's an angry outburst instead of a reasoned response, and at worst it is meant to chill speech and curb central bank independence,\" he added.",

    "description": "The admission comes after former President Barack Obama went viral for claiming aliens are real",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, says the president has a speech pre-written and is ready to address the discovery of aliens.\n\nLara, 43, made the shocking claim in an episode of the New York Post’s Pod Force One podcast, published Wednesday, after she was asked about former President Barack Obama's apparent confirmation that aliens are real during an interview last weekend.\n\n“I believe I’ve heard on your podcast that you’ve discussed with the president these UFOs. Do you think that he’s about to make an announcement about UFOs, because President Obama was just on a podcast talking about how he believes in UFOs and hinting that he saw something when he was president?” host Miranda Devine asked.\n\n“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...”Lara began.\n\nHowever, the president reportedly “played a little coy” when she and her husband, his son, Eric Trump, inquired about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\n\n“Eric and I were like, ‘Oh my gosh, he won’t even fully tell us, maybe there’s more to it,’” she said.\n\n“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara added.\n\nHer comments come as Obama made a stunning admission over the weekend during an appearance on the No Lie With Brian Tyler Cohen podcast.\n\nWhen asked about extraterrestrials, Obama replied, “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in — what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”\n\nThe Internet went wild over his admission that aliens are real, prompting the former commander-in-chief to take to Instagram to clarify his stance.\n\n“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify,” the former president wrote. “Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there.”\n\n“But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us,” he continued,\n\nDoubling down on his claim, he added, “Really!”\n\nIts long been speculated by many that aliens and UFOs are hidden at the mysterious Area 51 base in southern Nevada — and a documentary released last year suggested that Trump may soon confirm the existence of other life forms.\n\nIn The Age of Disclosure, director Dan Farah suggests that a massive government cover-up operation has concealed the existence of non-human intelligence, but that the cover-up will soon be exposed.\n\n“I think it's only a matter of time before the release of this film is followed by a sitting president stepping to the podium and telling the world, ‘We're not alone in the universe,’” Farah told Entertainment Weekly in late November.\n\n“It's the most significant moment a leader could possibly have.”\n\nDespite Farah’s claims, Trump has not yet shared a definitive answer about the existence of aliens since returning to office.",

States, including California, have been among the main foils to various ⁠Trump administration policies, launching dozens of suits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Tuesday told Reuters about plans to ​sue over ​changes in vaccine policy and ​a plan to challenge ‌the rescission of a key Environmental Protection Agency finding, known as the endangerment finding, that was key to climate change regulation, for instance.\n\nThe new suit responds in part to California's loss of $1.2 billion in federal funding for ‌the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen ​Energy Systems, or ARCHES, Bonta ​said. The hydrogen plan ​was intended to replace fossil fuels in ‌utilities, public transit, trucking and ​ports.\n\nFederal agencies must ​execute laws, California said. \"It's as simple as Congress has the power of the purse, not the executive ​branch, and Congress ‌already appropriated this funding,\" Bonta said in an ​interview on Tuesday, ahead of the announcement.",

    "fullText": "Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is having an ‘I told you so’ moment when it comes to President Trump’s tariffs.\n\nAt November’s blockbuster arguments, Gorsuch raised alarm about what he called a “one-way ratchet” of authority from Congress to the president if Trump wins a case that challenges his use of emergency powers to impose duties on a host of countries.\n\n“It’s going to be veto-proof,” Gorsuch warned of Trump’s declared emergencies.\n\n“What president’s ever going to give that power back? A pretty rare president. So how should that inform our view?”\n\nGorsuch’s concern is now in the limelight as the justices prepare to return to the bench to issue opinions on three separate days between now and next Wednesday.\n\nLast week, Trump saw one of the first major pushbacks from Congress on the matter, when six House Republicans joined Democrats in voting 219-211 to repeal Trump’s Canada tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). That measure now heads to the Senate, where four Republicans joined Democrats last year on a similar effort. The new vote only needs a simple majority.\n\nBut even if it gets to Trump’s desk, the revolt is largely symbolic. The bipartisan support for repealing the tariffs falls far short of the two-thirds majority needed in both the House and Senate to override an expected veto.\n\nGorsuch saw it coming — and he wasn’t the only Trump-nominated justice to read the tea leaves back at November’s arguments.\n\n“Let’s say that we adopt your interpretation of the statute,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett told the government. “If Congress said, ‘Whoa, we don’t like that, that gives a president too much authority under IEEPA,’ it’s going to have a very hard time pulling the tariff power out of IEEPA, correct?”\n\nCongress can amend IEEPA at any time to make clear whether the 1977 law does, or does not, authorize Trump’s tariffs. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has expressed no appetite for doing so, leaving the nine justices to parse the nearly half-century-old phrasing that has left global financial markets in suspense for months.\n\n“I think the sentiment is that we allow a little bit more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch,” Johnson said last week.\n\nNo one outside the court knows if the tariffs’ opinion is being sent to the printers right now, or if there’s still time for tweaks. When it is released, watch to see if any of the justices take note of the recent developments on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe Trump administration hopes to convince the justices that Congress can, indeed, claw back power from the president. Solicitor General D. John Sauer would like everyone to remember that Congress clubbed together the votes to terminate the massive COVID-19 emergency just a few years ago.\n\n“What the statute reflects is there’s going to be the ability for a sort of political consensus against a declared emergency. Nevertheless, that’s a political discipline,” Sauer said during the tariff arguments.\n\nSpeculation is still running rampant about exactly when the Supreme Court will release the highly anticipated decision. Some 105 days have now passed since oral arguments, longer than other recent expedited cases.\n\nWhen asked about the wait during her book promo on “CBS Mornings” last week, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t think much of it.  There are “lots of nuanced legal issues” and “it takes a while to write,” she said.\n\n“The court is going through its process of deliberation, and the American people expect for us to be thorough and clear in our determinations, and sometimes that takes time,” Jackson said.\n\nThe fact the junior liberal justice said anything at all was notable, as Supreme Court justices typically steer clear of talking about pending cases. Full stop.\n\nWe’ve got our ears perked up. As the justices return to the bench, the court has signaled it will hand down opinions Friday, Tuesday and next Wednesday.\n\nBettors on prediction markets think it could be coming. After the court scheduled the opinion days, the odds of the tariff decision landing this month jumped from 40 percent to more than 70 percent on Kalshi, a popular prediction market.\n\nSandwiched between two of the opinion day releases is the State of the Union, scheduled for Tuesday evening.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and several of the other justices typically attend; here’s the list of who has shown up each year. It’s a rare face-to-face moment between the justices and the president, with every move scrutinized.\n\nAs Roberts and the others sat in last year for Trump’s address, they were also sitting on the president’s emergency appeal seeking to freeze foreign aid. The justices released the decision — against Trump — at 8:59 a.m. the next morning.\n\nWelcome to The Gavel, The Hill’s weekly courts newsletter from Ella Lee and Zach Schonfeld. Reach out to us on X (@ByEllaLee, @ZachASchonfeld) or Signal (elee.03, zachschonfeld.48). \n\nJudges get new leeway to defend the courts\n\nFederal judges have been granted new wiggle room to speak out about the importance of the judiciary as threats and attacks on the courts surge.\n\nAn advisory opinion from the Judicial Conference’s Committee on Codes of Conduct affirmed that the ethics code abided by judges allows them to advocate for the rule of law and defend the independence of the courts, including to seek increased judicial security and funding.\n\nThe opinion goes further to say that, in some circumstances, judges may stand up for their peers against unjust attacks.\n\n“Although this Commentary addresses persecution specifically, the Committee believes the Code and its previous advisory opinions leave room, in at least some circumstances, for the measured defense of judicial colleagues from illegitimate forms of criticism and attacks that risk undermining judicial independence or the rule of law, whether or not they rise to the level of persecution,” the opinion reads.\n\nIt makes no reference to any specific assault on the judiciary. But it follows years of tongue-lashing and impeachment threats from Trump and his allies, especially toward judges who rule against the president. At the same time, public trust in the courts has fallen to near-record lows.\n\nIt points to Roberts’s 2024 year-end report as a guidepost, which addressed four detriments to judicial independence: violence, intimidation, disinformation and threats to defy lawfully entered judgments. Roberts has pushed back on Trump’s threats, though he’s also at turns spoken out about Democrats’ rhetoric.\n\nJudges should avoid acting in a manner that detracts from their official duties and impartiality of the court, commenting on the merits of active matters or engaging in certain political activities, the opinion says.\n\nThey also must watch their tone in writing outside the courtroom, avoiding “sensationalism,” and consider where they choose to speak, so as not to create questions about their fairness.\n\n“These general cautions in the Code do not lend themselves well to precise definitions,” the opinion notes, “and even seemingly clear limits permit a variety of exceptions.”\n\nGabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, called the opinion a “a strong step forward for ethics and for judicial independence,” suggesting it showed the committee pushing back on Trump.\n\n“Though individuals are not called out by name, this is a strong rebuke of the Trump administration’s ‘war’ on the judiciary and comes one day after Attorney General [Pam] Bondi denounced ‘liberal activist judges’ for taking part in ‘coordinated […] unlawful attack’ against President Trump’s ‘authority,’” he said in a statement Thursday. “Any judge who, in a measured manner, seeks to counter that nonsense would thus be ethically sound.”\n\nAs attacks on the judiciary have escalated, some judges have spoken out anonymously in the press, or in rarer instances, publicly. It’s especially prevalent as threats against judges continue to rise.\n\nIn fiscal 2025, there were 564 threats against judges, according to U.S. Marshals Service data. Since fiscal 2026 began in October, there have already been 176 threats.\n\nWhat to know about the Supreme Court’s new recusal software\n\nMore ethics news landed Tuesday, this time from the Supreme Court.\n\nStarting in March, the justices will use new software to help identify when they should recuse from a case.\n\nIt’s the justices’ latest effort to align themselves with lower federal judges, who have been required to use an automated conflict-screening system for the past two decades.\n\nThe Supreme Court is not bound by lower judges’ code of conduct.\n\nIt has left the justices playing catch up as public scrutiny into their ethics sharpens, spurred by investigations into the justices’ book deals and luxury trips paid for by billionaires.\n\nTwo years ago, the justices responded to mounting pressure by agreeing to a statement of ethical principles.\n\nCritics emphasize it has no enforcement mechanism. It did, however, direct that the court consider adding a new screening software.\n\nTo be clear, the justices have long identified conflicts. Last term, the justices recused more than 80 times in total, according to The Gavel’s docket tracker. And since this term began in October, the recusal count has already surpassed 30.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito is by far the leader, a reflection of his decision to own direct stock holdings in more than two dozen companies. Alito this term has recused more than twice as many times as any of his colleagues.\n\nStill, catching all necessary recusals is a tall task. The court received nearly 4,000 petitions to take up cases last term, many of which involve a complicated web of companies.\n\nJust last month, Alito recused from a battle between Louisiana parishes and major oil companies at the eleventh hour before the arguments. Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips, which owns a company named in the suit, but that company had insisted it was no longer involved in the case. It turned out not to be true.\n\nAnd in 2024, Gorsuch belatedly stepped aside from another environmental case after pressure from Democrats over his ties to a billionaire that had filed a brief.\n\nRoth, Fix The Court’s executive director, said the more effective change would’ve been for Alito to divest all direct stock holdings. Every other justice does so except for Roberts.\n\n“So although the new rule is a net positive since it comes in service of the full Court’s adoption of conflict-check software, it’s not a major improvement, and it should not have taken 827 days post-Code to implement,” Roth said in a statement.\n\n“That’s especially true since lower court judges have been required to use software-based conflict screening for 20 years, and several justices have been rumored to continue to use it after they were elevated,” he continued.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not publicly demoed its new software. If you’ve seen it, drop us a line.\n\nWhen it launches, litigants must send a list of the stock tickers for companies involved in their case so it can be run through the screening.\n\nKelly’s court win: A federal judge blocked the Pentagon’s efforts to censure Sen. Mark Kelly and lower his retirement rank in the wake of a video in which the senator and other fellow Democrats called on service members to reject unlawful orders.\n\nNY redistricting reaches SCOTUS: Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) urged the Supreme Court to stop her state judiciary from ordering a redraw of her congressional district ahead of the midterms, casting it as unconstitutional.\n\nMN evidence fight: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said it was formally notified by the FBI that the bureau will not share any information about its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.\n\nGateway Tunnel fight: A federal appeals court allowed a judge’s order requiring the Trump administration to resume funding for the Gateway tunnel project connecting New York and New Jersey to take effect.\n\nBenghazi attack prosecution: A man facing federal charges in connection with the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans pleaded not guilty.\n\nSwift resolution: Taylor Swift filed legal action to block a bedding company from getting a trademark on a logo that says, “Swift Home.” The company soon after withdrew its application. Read the BBC’s report on the dustup.\n\n‘Straight to the source’: As the Supreme Court mulls its tariff decision, Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) visited the National Archives to lay eyes on the constitutional ink that gives Congress the power to collect taxes and duties. “Went straight to the source. The Constitution is clear,” Bacon wrote on social media. The archives staff has a strict prohibition on taking photos of the Constitution, so add that to the list of special privileges you get as a member of Congress.\n\nMr. Wonderful wins defamation suit: A federal judge awarded “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary $2.83 million in his defamation lawsuit against Ben Armstrong, a famous cryptocurrency influencer known as “BitBoy Crypto.” Armstrong called O’Leary a murderer over a 2019 fatal accident involving his boat, which his wife was driving. She was later cleared of wrongdoing. The judge entered default judgment after Armstrong failed to meet court deadlines.\n\nPetitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.\n\nHere’s a look at four major legal battles that reach the Supreme Court this week. At their closed-door conference Friday, the justices will consider taking them up for next term.\n\nNot all the cases are likely to be granted, but they each are legal battles that have played prominently for years:\n\nTrump’s E. Jean Carroll verdict: President Trump seeks review of the jury’s verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s, which Trump denies, and ordered him to pay $5 million. The president says the jury shouldn’t have heard the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape or testimony from other women who have accused Trump of misconduct. He also argues he should’ve been allowed to tell jurors that a Democratic mega-donor was paying Carroll’s legal bills. The case is Trump v. Carroll.\n\nMore guns: For weeks, the court has stalled announcing whether it will hear Second Amendment challenges against AR-15 and high-capacity magazine bans as well as the federal felon-in-possession law. The pileup grows this week. In Fooks v. Maryland and Mancuso v. New York, the court is asked to hear challenges to state felon-in-possession laws. And in National Association for Gun Rights v. Lamont and Grant v. Higgins, it is also being petitioned to hear a challenge to Connecticut’s AR-15 ban.\n\nNRA’s free speech fight: The National Rifle Association (NRA) is at the high court, but not on the Second Amendment. It’s about the First Amendment. In 2024, the justices unanimously ruled the gun rights group can proceed in its free speech fight against a New York regulator. When the case returned to a lower court, it again sided with the regulator. So, the NRA is back. The case is NRA v. Vullo.\n\nFor-profit college settlement: Everglades College wants the Supreme Court to revive its fight against a class action settlement the Biden administration approved, which cancels $7.5 billion in student debt for those who alleged fraud by for-profit colleges. Lower courts ruled the college had no legal standing, meaning no right to sue over the settlement. The case is Everglades College v.

The former model, 55, appeared to take her husband’s joshing seriously, after Donald Trump joked that there was a “movie star” on board Air Force One on Monday evening as they flew from Florida to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Melania, who used Presidents Day to plug her movie, emerged from the aircraft at the strip before making her way to Marine One for her onward journey. She stepped out alongside her 79-year-old husband, wearing a long coat, leather gloves, long boots and sunglasses—a peculiar choice given that it was pitch-black outside.",

    "description": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve that asserts US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is disputing a new paper from the New York Federal Reserve asserting that US consumers and businesses are bearing the bulk of the higher costs from tariffs imposed last year.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined, because what they've done is they've put out a conclusion, which has created a lot of news that's highly partisan, based on analysis that wouldn't be accepted in a first-semester econ class.\"\n\nWhat percentage of tariff costs did US consumers bear?\n\nHow did the Trump administration respond to the study?\n\nWhat did the NY Fed study find about tariff costs?\n\nHow did tariff pass-through rates change throughout 2025?\n\nAuthors Mary Amiti, head of labor and product markets at the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, along with research analyst Chris Flanagan and research economist Sebastian Heise, analyzed the tariffs instituted last year and found that 94% were borne by the US in the first eight months of 2025. Just 6% of those costs were absorbed by foreign exporters.\n\nThe analysis covered 12-month changes from January 2024 through November 2025 (the most recent available data). The analysis also noted how the pass-through of costs changed over the course of 2025. For instance, by November, the pass-through of costs borne in the US had declined to 86%.\n\nThe authors said their results show that a 10% tariff led to only a 0.6 percentage-point decline in foreign export prices. But they also found that the tariff pass-through into import prices declined later last year, as more exporters bore the costs of tariffs. In November, a 10% tariff was associated with a 1.4% decline in foreign export prices, though still an 86% pass-through to US import prices.\n\nThe authors said the higher import prices caused firms to reorganize their supply chains.\n\n\"In sum, U.S. firms and consumers continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHassett maintains that tariffs affect a multitude of price factors, including supply and demand, which shift around consumer and producer surpluses.\n\n\"They’re basically only looking at changes in prices,\" Hassett said.\n\nHe pointed to other metrics, such as lower inflation and higher wages, which suggest consumers are better off.\n\n\"Incomes are up way more than the cost of living, and that's the real wage gain that this silly Fed study neglects to mention,\" Hassett said.",

    "description": "Coffee prices in the US have continued to rise, even after Trump walked back some tariff threats against major coffee-producing nations.",
    "fullText": "Inflation may be cooling, but there's one part of Americans' routines that isn't yet feeling relief: a morning cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee was among the commodities hit by Donald Trump's tariff policies last year, with prices continuing to rise in 2026. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average price of coffee across the US reached $9.37 per pound in January, a 33% increase since last year.\n\nThe 33% increase has pushed coffee bean prices to their highest level since the 1980s, when data on the commodity were first collected. Yet, while costs in the US have surged, they've actually fallen on a global scale, dropping to $3.64 per pound in January.\n\nTariffs on imports from Brazil are part of the reason they're still high in the US, but they don't fully explain the disconnect.\n\nGlobally, the combination of a positive supply outlook for the coming year, as previous production shortfalls start to ease, is keeping a lid on international coffee prices.\n\nMeanwhile, a split between the US and the rest of the world has been taking shape for a while.\n\nCoffee shops began raising prices following Trump's sweeping Liberation Day tariffs. This included levying a 46% tariff against Vietnam and 10% tariffs against Brazil and Colombia, the three nations that account for more than 60% of the US's coffee supply.\n\nIn July, Trump moved to impose a 40% tariff on Brazilian imports of food and beverages, a policy that was set to spike the cost of coffee. He ultimately walked the decision back in November, but the impact is still being felt in coffee markets.\n\nImporters typically lock in prices months in advance. As such, Trump's rollback of tariffs on major coffee producers likely hasn't yet shown up in prices.\n\nWhile it's true that the post-tariff discount could be felt in the coming months, it doesn't mean prices will come down, especially as consumers seem willing to pay higher prices at the moment. Leading coffee stocks such as Starbucks and Keurig Dr. Pepper have performed well in 2026, rising 14% and 5% year to date, respectively.",

    "fullText": "For eight years, President Barack Obama's aides marveled that no amount of mockery, dismissal or scandal could make Donald Trump go away.\n\nTheir bewilderment is threaded through hundreds of interviews with administration officials released Tuesday in a far-reaching oral history of the Obama presidency. Throughout, Obama's advisers — some of the nation’s most accomplished political and policy experts — described their ongoing education about an electorate increasingly influenced by whatever the nascent social media told them.\n\nOver two terms in the White House, they got glimpses of a future in which conspiracy theories, such as the lie that Obama was born outside the United States, survived online. What they missed, right up to Election Night 2016, was Trump's political resilience and his understanding that alienated Americans could vote for a man the White House considered a “clown.”\n\n“He's done,” David Simas, Obama's White House political director, recalls telling the president. It was October 2016, five weeks before Election Day, and Simas had just handed his phone to Obama to watch the explosive news of Trump's “Access Hollywood” recording. Fast-forward to hours before voters went to the polls. Simas recognized Democrat Hillary Clinton's lead had shrunk to perhaps three points. “She’s fine,” he recalls thinking. “That’s the night before.”\n\nTrump defeated Clinton in the Electoral College by 306 to Clinton's 232 but lost the popular vote, an outcome long known to have stunned and devastated Democrats. But the interviews filled in the degree to which aides, pollsters and news outlets disregarded the prospect of a Trump victory even as Americans increasingly distrusted government and established political figures.\n\n“Not many people even expected that he had a chance to win,” said former White House press secretary Josh Earnest. “It was hard not to take it personally, because Trump’s candidacy, the essence of his being, and everything that he stood for, and everything about the way that he carried himself, and everything that he championed, and his rhetoric, his campaign tactics— all were anathema to everything that the Obama campaign and the Obama era, the Obama administration, had been about.”\n\nAcross the Obama Presidency Oral History project's interviews with 450 people, his advisers said that Trump rebuked what they saw as the administration's accomplishments: An emergency rescue of the economy, a bailout of the auto industry, a form of national health insurance and landmark climate change regulation. All along, many described climbing a learning curve on how young and old Americans get their news, red and blue “team” politics — and how to leverage social media, something Trump seemed to innately understand.\n\nAn extraordinary stretch that began in April 2011 illustrated the denial, the dismissal and what's thought to have been a moment that helped cement Trump's decision to run for president.\n\nThe New York mogul had been fueling the false conspiracy theory that Obama, who was born in Hawaii, had not been born in the United States. That suggested he was not qualified to be president, a question that touched on Obama's race. It bothered him personally, advisers said, and initially Obama agreed with many advisers to ignore it.\n\n“He felt with all the important things that needed to be dealt with, this was stupid and shouldn’t be dignified. But ultimately, it had to be,” recalled David Axelrod, then Obama's senior adviser.\n\nObama released his long-form birth certificate on April 27, showing he'd been born in Hawaii.\n\n“I thought it was a mistake at the time, because I thought, 'This is absurd, and it’s unnecessary and beneath him to dignify the question,” Nancy-Ann DeParle, a former White House deputy chief of staff for policy.\n\nWhat it meant for speechwriter Jon Favreau was that Obama's jokes for the White House Correspondents Dinner just a few days later had to be changed. They knew Trump would be at the dinner and the issues at hand, Favreau said in his interview, were serious. “I thought what he was doing was racist,” Favreau said. “I thought that it was not just damaging to Obama but damaging to the country.”\n\nSeriousness aside, he described a marathon of joke-writing with Hollywood director and writer Judd Apatow on the phone that left Favreau and others in hysterics. The prospect of Trump becoming president? “Not even a brief moment did I ever think that,” he said.\n\nAs for the speech, Obama “loved it,” Favreau said. Obama's sense of humor, he noted, can lean sarcastic.\n\nObama opened with a cheery, “Mahalo!” and played a mock birth video in a dig at Fox News.\n\n“I want to make clear to the Fox News table: That was a joke,” he said. “That was not my real birth video. That was a children’s cartoon.”\n\nThen he noted that “Donald Trump is here tonight!” Trump glowered from his table.\n\n\"We all know about your credentials and breadth of experience,” Obama continued, as the Washington glitterati snickered. Just recently on Trump's show, the president said, “At the steakhouse, the men’s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around.” Whom to fire in such a situation, Obama said sarcastically, was among “the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.”\n\nThe next day, Obama announced the killing of Sept. 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden during a U.S. commando raid in Pakistan. He'd authorized the strike earlier in the week without the knowledge of most close aides, and so knew about it as he relished his takedown of Trump.\n\n“In some ways, it was cathartic for the president,” Axelrod said of the speech.\n\nEarlier in the evening, he recalled, he walked by Trump's table and overheard him saying he's toying with running for president. Axelrod “chuckled at it and went to my seat.”\n\n“Obviously, we misread that,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Data analytics firm moves from Denver after about six years and joins host of businesses relocating to south Florida\n\nPalantir announced on Tuesday that it has moved its headquarters to Miami from Denver. The data analytics company, criticized for its role in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, joins a host of other businesses and billionaires that recently moved to Florida in search of a more business-friendly climate.\n\nPalantir’s move across state lines comes after its chair, Peter Thiel, announced on 31 December that he opened a Miami office for his private investment firm. Thiel already has a mansion in Miami Beach. The company, previously headquartered in Palo Alto, announced the move on X but did not provide further details or respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s stay in Colorado lasted about six years; the company exited California in August 2020 – with its CEO, Alex Karp, citing disagreements with the state’s values.\n\nPalantir’s Denver office has frequently been the site of protest, as the company faces heated criticism for its involvement in the Trump administration’s push to deport immigrants. Tools and platforms built by Palantir have been used by the federal government in efforts to surveil and detain immigrants. The company has also inked a major contract with the UK’s National Health Service.\n\nColorado’s immigration and tech activists view Palantir’s departure as a result of their sustained organizing. Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former Palantir employee and organizer for AI regulation in Denver, said that a coalition of unions and grassroots organizations, including Denver Anti-War Action, held a few dozen town halls, strikes and protests that mounted pressure on Palantir’s presence in the city. Pinto also said that Palantir may have been dissuaded by Colorado’s state lawmakers taking the lead on AI regulation with proposals to limit surveillance and discrimination.\n\n“Colorado has rejected the values of Palantir – the values of an economy built on exploitation of people’s data, whether it’s for warfare or for immigration enforcement,” Pinto said.\n\nMany of California’s wealthiest billionaires seem to be considering a move to Florida – spooked by the state’s consideration of a billionaire tax. There has also been a concerted effort by the business leaders Ken Griffin and Stephen Ross to convince billionaires to move to south Florida and to bring their businesses with them.\n\nPalantir has tried to distance itself from Trump’s immigration apparatus, but that has not quelled protest. Some of the company’s employees appear to be disturbed, too. Karp recorded a video about Palantir’s involvement with ICE for staff and said they could sign NDAs if they wanted more details, according to Wired.\n\nJames Fishback, a Republican candidate for Florida governor, wrote on X in response to Palantir’s move, saying he would ban Palantir from all government contracts if elected. “You are a threat to our civil liberties,” Fishback wrote. He had voiced the same position last month. Fishback’s commitment comes amid increasing pressure on lawmakers to evaluate their relationship with Palantir. The nationwide campaign Purge Palantir has been documenting politicians who received funds from the company’s executives and pressuring them not to accept their donations. The campaign has had some success so far. The Colorado Sun reported that the Colorado representative Jason Crow and Colorado senator John Hickenlooper planned to donate more than $50,000 each, in campaign contributions from Palantir, to immigrant rights groups.\n\nPalantir blew past Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter of 2025 and reported 66% year-over-year growth in revenue from government contracts, to $570m. Its stock, however, has sunk 20% since the start of 2026.",

    "fullText": "Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) on Tuesday questioned why President Trump and other GOP lawmakers haven’t locked down the Texas Senate race with an endorsement in the three-way party primary. \n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) and Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-Texas) are vying for Cornyn’s seat in the Senate. The frequently nasty battle between Paxton and Cornyn has left some Democrats thinking it could create an opening for their party in November, particularly if Paxton wins.\n\nFetterman said he thinks his party can regain the House but argued the battle to retake the Senate majority will be an uphill one during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\nHe also argued that Trump and the GOP are putting Texas in play by not backing Cornyn.\n\n“I mean, as you point out, the margin is very close. And there’s always — history always tells us there’s a backlash against the party in power. … So I think most people would have assumed that the House is going to flip. Now, here in the Senate, that’s a little more difficult, and now you have other races in play,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.\n\n“For me, like for Texas, for example, Cornyn is a reasonable Republican, and now that would be money in the bank. But now I don’t know why politically — I’m not sure why the Republicans and the president wouldn’t sit on that and just lock down Texas. But for me, there’s other states that are in flux,” he added.\n\nDemocrats are having their own contentious primary in Texas between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico.\n\nFetterman has shared a dismal outlook on his party. On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania senator said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) is “part of the rot in the Democratic Party” for her foreign policy stance denouncing Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n“For me, stand with Israel. I’ll never vote for any kinds of restrictions on aid, whether it’s military, financial, or intelligence. There are never to be any restrictions on that. And now, for here we are, we can have peace. Again, that’s become part of the serious problem in our party,” Fetterman told Bartiromo.\n\nHe later added, “I refuse to pander to the part of my Democratic Party that finds that there’s value in being anti-Israel. And that’s effectively — they use the word ‘anti-Zionism’ — I mean, effectively what that’s really become on college campuses and places is just antisemitism. We have a problem here in our party, and I’m going to stand against that and always be an unapologetic supporter for Israel.”",

In a petition demanding the return of 2020 election ballots, officials accused the FBI of having “serious” omissions in its successful petition for a search warrant to raid the county’s election office near Atlanta. “Instead of alleging probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, the affidavit does nothing more than describe the types of human errors that its own sources confirm occur in almost every election—without any intentional wrongdoing whatsoever,” the filing says.",

    "title": "Poll: How many Americans rank Trump as the 'worst' vs. 'best' president in U.S. history?",
    "description": "Amid this year's Presidents' Day celebrations, survey respondents tell Yahoo and YouGov that Trump is doing a worse job than Joe Biden and Barack Obama.",
    "fullText": "As Americans return to work and school after the long Presidents’ Day weekend, a new Yahoo/YouGov poll has found that 40% of them now consider Donald Trump to be the “worst president in U.S. history.”\n\nAnother 12% think Trump is “worse than average” — meaning that overall, a majority of Americans (about 53%) now rate Trump as one of the least successful presidents ever to hold the office.\n\nOnly a third of Americans say Trump is either the best president in U.S. history (12%) or better than average (21%). An additional 9% believe Trump “ranks somewhere in the middle.”\n\nThe survey of 1,704 U.S. adults was conducted just before Presidents’ Day, which roughly coincides with George Washington’s birthday and honors the first U.S. president as well as all those who served after him.\n\nHistorians often use Presidents’ Day as an opportunity to rank commanders in chief; the last major tally was published in February 2024 by the Presidential Greatness Project. In it, 154 current and recent members of the American Political Science Association awarded Abraham Lincoln, the top finisher, an average zero-to-100 score of 93.87. Trump finished last, with an average score of 10.92.\n\nBut that was before Trump’s comeback victory the following November — and before the sweeping changes of his first year back in office. So now, two Februaries later, how are ordinary Americans judging Trump’s second term in relation to the presidencies that preceded it?\n\nNot very positively. Trump’s job approval rating (38%) is currently as low as it has ever been; his disapproval rating (58%) is higher than ever. That puts Trump a full 20 points “underwater.” In comparison, former President Joe Biden was about 8 points underwater at this stage of his presidency.\n\nIn particular, independents — who tend to decide elections — have soured on Trump. Before Trump took office again, more independents said they expected him to change America for the better (41%) than said they expected him to change America for the worse (34%). But today, only 23% of independents say Trump is changing America for the better, while a clear majority (57%) say he is changing America for the worse.\n\nAll told, a majority of Americans now say for the first time that Trump is making America worse (52%) rather than better (34%) — and that his second term has turned out to be worse than they expected (51%) instead of better (25%).\n\nAmericans also think Trump is failing to meet the standard of performance set by his immediate Democratic predecessors.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump recently replaced a White House portrait of Biden with a photo of an autopen — and described Biden as “by far, the worst President in American History” on the plaque beneath the image — 49% of Americans think Trump is “doing a worse job than Biden.” Significantly fewer (41%) think Trump is doing a better job than Biden.\n\nAmong independents, a majority (53%) now believe Trump is doing worse than Biden. Just 33% say Trump is doing better.\n\nTrump compares even less favorably to former President Barack Obama — “one of the most divisive political figures in American History,” according to his new White House plaque. A full 55% of Americans think Trump is doing a worse job than Obama. Only 37% think Trump is doing better. Among independents, those numbers are 57% and 16%, respectively.\n\nThe president also faces a widening gap in the intensity of opinion between Americans who think he’s doing a good job and Americans who think he’s doing a bad job. Forty-nine percent now “strongly” disapprove of Trump’s job performance; less than half as many (22%) strongly approve.\n\nThe gap between Americans who consider Trump the worst president in U.S. history and those who consider him the best is similar.\n\nThe Yahoo survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 1,704 U.S. adults interviewed online from Feb. 9 to 12, 2026. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, 2024 election turnout and presidential vote, party identification and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. Party identification is weighted to the estimated distribution at the time of the election (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. adults. The margin of error is approximately 3%.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump family company has filed to trademark the use of the president's name on airports but says it doesn't plan on charging a fee — at least for a proposed renaming of one near his Florida home.\n\nApplications filed by the Trump Organization with the federal trademark office are seeking exclusive rights to use the president's name on airports and dozens of related things found there, from buses shuttling passengers to umbrellas and travel bags to flight suits. The filings come amid debate in Florida over a state bill to name the Palm Beach airport after Trump and a dispute over funding of a tunnel between New York and New Jersey that is tied up with proposals that both it and the Dulles International Airport in Virginia bear his name.\n\nThe Trump Organization said that the applications were triggered by the Florida bill and that it didn't seek any profit — only protection against “bad actors” given that the Trump name is the “most infringed trademark in the world.”\n\n“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the company said it in a statement, referring to what is now called the Palm Beach International Airport near Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nThe company didn't respond immediately when asked if it would charge royalties for the use of the name at other airports in the future, or on merchandise listed for protection in the filings.\n\nJosh Gerben, a trademark lawyer who uncovered the filings over the weekend, said the applications were the first of their kind he's ever seen.\n\n“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honor, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote on his blog. “I should be very clear: these are trademark filings that are completely unprecedented.”\n\nThe applications filed by a family company unit called DTTM Operations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are for the use of three names — President Donald J. Trump International Airport, Donald J. Trump International Airport and DJT.\n\nThe family has been on a branding spree in the past year, putting its name on towers, golf resorts and residential developments in Dubai, India, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. The company has also been selling Trump branded electric guitars, bibles and sneakers, ventures that also fall under the DTTM unit.\n\nIn response to criticism that he and his family are profiting off the presidency, Trump has said that his business is held in trust by his sons and that he has no day-to-day involvement in the company.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration suffered a stinging defeat on Presidents Day after a Bush-appointed judge ruled against it while citing the dystopian novel 1984.\n\nU.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe ruled on Monday that an exhibit about nine people enslaved by George Washington be reinstated after the Trump administration ordered its removal last month.\n\nThe National Park Service removed the exhibit from Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia in response to an executive order from Trump that was aimed at “restoring truth and sanity to American history.” The order instructed the Interior Department to ensure that the nation’s museums, parks and landmarks do not display anything that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House and the National Park Service for comment.\n\nNews cameras and onlookers recorded staff removing the exhibit late last month, with one park employee reportedly telling the Philadelphia Inquirer, “I’m just following my orders.”\n\nThe exhibit was located at the President’s House site in Philadelphia, where George and Martha Washington lived along with nine people enslaved by the couple when the city was briefly the nation’s capital.\n\nRufe ruled that all materials must be restored in their original condition while a lawsuit challenging the legality of the removal filed by Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker plays out.\n\nTrump’s executive order, issued on March 27, 2025, and titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” stated that, “Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation’s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.”\n\n“This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.”\n\nIn her ruling, Rufe referenced George Orwell’s 1984, writing, “As if the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s 1984 now existed, with its motto ‘Ignorance is Strength,’ this Court is now asked to determine whether the federal government has the power it claims — to dissemble and disassemble historical truths when it has some domain over historical facts.”\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to whitewash history at multiple historical sites around the country, including removing a pride flag from the Stonewall National Monument in New York City just last week and erasing references to transgender people on the National Park Service’s website for the monument.\n\nReferences to the dispossession and mistreatment of Native Americans were also removed from an exhibit at Grand Canyon National Park, and roadside displays addressing climate change, pollution and mining were also flagged for potential removal.\n\nSenior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association Kristen Brengel told the Washington Post that the White House’s efforts should “offend every American.”\n\n“We are capable of hearing about our tragedies and our victories, and this systematic erasure should concern everyone in our country.”\n\nMS NOW’s Rachel Maddow celebrated the ruling on the Monday night edition of her show, quoting extensively from the ruling—noting that Rufe was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush—and telling viewers, “Happy Presidents’ Day, Philadelphia. You are getting your history put back up by court order at the President’s House.”",

    "fullText": "George W. Bush has penned a Presidents Day essay that made some pointed observations about power, humility, and presidents who refuse to step down from office.\n\nThe essay was published Monday by More Perfect, a bipartisan alliance working to “protect and renew” American democracy in the lead-up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe piece, which pays homage to George Washington, is the inaugural entry in a new history project called “In Pursuit,” and while it does not name President Donald Trump, it does seem to shade him, The New York Times reported.\n\n“Our first president could have remained all-powerful, but twice he chose not to,” Bush wrote. “In doing so, he set a standard for all presidents to live up to.”\n\nThe first president’s decision to relinquish control of the U.S. Army after the American Revolution and to step down from the presidency after two terms “ensured America wouldn’t become a monarchy, or worse,” Bush added.\n\nHis words seemed heavy with subtext, considering the current occupant of the White House tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, and is now threatening to run for a third, illegal presidential term.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nElsewhere in Bush’s essay, the 43rd president also praised Washington’s other non-Trumpian traits, describing how the nation’s first president made a point of cultivating self-control, courteousness, modesty, and diplomacy.\n\n“Few qualities have inspired me more than Washington’s humility,” he wrote. “Washington modeled what it means to put the good of the nation over self-interest and selfish ambition… he carried himself with dignity and self-restraint, honoring the office [of the president] without allowing to become invested with near-mythical powers.”\n\nThe Times noted that despite participating in the “In Pursuit” series—which will also feature contributions from former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as Republicans such as Chief Supreme Court Justice John Roberts—Bush is not giving interviews.\n\nHis essay speaks for itself, former National Archivist Colleen Shogan told the Times. Shogan was abruptly fired by Trump in February 2025 and is now overseeing “In Pursuit.”\n\nThe project’s goal is to make history “relevant” but not overly narrow, she told the Times.\n\n“We are taking the long view of things,” she said. “The lesson of presidential humility transcends time.”",

    "description": "\"This amendment creates a narrow, commonsense check to ensure the pardon power is used fairly and responsibly regardless of who occupies the White House\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on the South Lawn before departing the White House, Friday, Feb. 6, 2026, in Washington. \n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) signed on Monday to co-sponsor a Democrat-led bill to amend the U.S. Constitution to give Congress oversight of presidential pardons, a measure aimed at pushing back at President Donald Trump’s highly controversial use of the presidential pardon power.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Johnny Olszewski (D-MD) last December and would allow for a minimum of 20 House members and five senators to call for congressional review of a pardon, which would lead to a 60-day deadline for Congress to nullify that pardon with a two-thirds majority vote – similar to a veto override.\n\nOlszewski announced his bill, the Pardon Integrity Act, in a floor speech listing off some of Trump’s most controversial pardons, including a blanket pardon for all January 6th rioters – including those who violently attacked police officers.\n\n“None of us should accept it as normal practice that a president, any president, used their executive pardon power to absolve convicted drug kingpins, those found guilty of violently attacking law enforcement officers, and even a money laundering crypto magnate with ties to the president’s family business,” Olszewski said in his speech, adding:\n\nYet, this is exactly what President Trump did. On his first day back in office, President Trump pardoned 1,500 people involved in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Since then, he’s pardoned or commuted the sentences of nearly 90 others. Just recently, he added former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez to that list. Hernandez was serving a 45-year prison sentence for conspiring to smuggle more than 400 tons or 4.5 billion doses of cocaine into the US.

Across multiple administrations, we’ve seen legitimate questions raised about how this authority has been used at the same time, the ability of Congress to provide oversight has weakened.\n\n“Frankly, it is clear to me the pardon authority has been abused. I’m pleased to cosponsor Rep.

Bacon’s support for the measure followed Trump’s pardon of several NFL players who had been convicted of various crimes, including drug trafficking.\n\nBacon is also behind a bipartisan bill to return the power to levy tariffs solely to Congress, adhering to the original wording of the Constitution.\n\nThe post Republican Joins With Dems on Constitutional Amendment to Give Congress Power to Reject Trump Pardons first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "A MAGA senator was called out after he tied himself in knots over Donald Trump’s efforts to imprison two of his Senate colleagues for a video in which they quoted the Military Code of Justice. A grand jury refused last week to indict six Democratic members of Congress, including Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, for interfering with the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the U.S. armed forces after they released a video reminding service members that they had a duty to disobey illegal orders. Trump had previously accused the lawmakers, all of whom have military or intelligence backgrounds, of “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” but several Senate Republicans called the attempted indictment “chilling” and said the administration’s “political warfare” needs to stop.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's official White House portrait does not feature an American flag in the background — it's the first presidential photo in over 60 years without one.\n\nTaken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok, the dramatically lit photo shows Trump against a dark backdrop with a serious expression. The style hearkens back to the past presidential portrait styles of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Calvin Coolidge, who also appeared unsmiling against dark backgrounds.\n\nAnd while there is no flag behind Trump in his new portrait, he is wearing an American flag pin on the lapel of his blue suit, a tradition that began with President George W. Bush's photo.\n\nA portrait of Trump released earlier last year, which did feature an American flag, was taken during the presidential transition period and \"was always meant to serve as a placeholder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nThe new photo is one of several aesthetic changes Trump has made to the White House in his second non-consecutive term. In the Entrance Hall, he moved President Barack Obama's painted White House portrait across the hall and replaced it with a painting depicting his raised fist following an assassination attempt. He has also added numerous gilded gold furnishings to the Oval Office and paved over the lawn in the Rose Garden to create a terrace he said would be better suited for large events.\n\nTake a look at how presidential portraits have changed through the years.",

In November, Meta pledged $600 billion to expand AI technology, infrastructure, and its workforce. Apple said in August it would boost its US infrastructure plans by adding another $100 billion, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion.\n\nAt the same time, energy costs are rising. Electric and gas utilities sought $31 billion in rate hikes from regulators last year, more than twice the $15 billion requested the year before, according to a study published last month by PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility customers. Many power providers have cited surging electricity demand from large-scale data centers as a key reason for seeking higher rates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed back on the idea that households should absorb those increases.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote last month in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nNavarro also said on Fox News that the US must keep expanding its data center capacity if it wants to remain \"No.1 on the global stage in terms of AI.\"\n\n\"We have to lead China and others on this,\" Navarro said. \"At the same time, we have to be mindful of the impacts across this nation.\"\n\nThe US must stay ahead \"not just for economic reasons but for national security reasons,\" because AI \"will be one of the most dangerous weapons of war,\" he added.\n\nSome AI companies have moved to reassure policymakers that households won't bear the cost of the industry's rapid expansion.\n\nAnthropic said on Thursday that it will cover 100% of the grid upgrade costs associated with its AI data centers.\n\n\"The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security,\" Anthropic said. \"But AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.\"\n\nThe pledge follows the company's November announcement that it plans to invest $50 billion in AI infrastructure, starting with facilities in Texas and New York.\n\nMicrosoft has taken a similar approach. Last month, the company said it would pay utility rates high enough to cover the electricity costs tied to its data centers and minimize the burden of data center expansion on surrounding communities.",

Several wealthy individuals have pledged to make further philanthropic contributions to the accounts.\n\nMany of those individuals are \"adopting\" specific states, meaning their contributions are limited to children living in those states.\n\nThe accounts can't be accessed for withdrawals until the child turns 18, at which point they can spend the money on major purchases like tuition or a down payment on a home.\n\nThe goal of it all: getting the next generation invested in capitalism and building wealth.\n\nHere's who's pouring money into Trump Accounts, and which children are eligible.\n\nDell CEO Michael Dell and his wife Susan have pledged to contribute $6.25 billion to the Trump Accounts of children across the country.\n\nSpecifically, the Dells are contributing $250 to 25 million children, including those who are 10 years or younger and live in a ZIP code where the median income is $150,000 or less.\n\nRecipients also must be born before January 1, 2025, meaning the Dells' contributions will go to children who aren't set to receive the $1,000 contribution from the federal government.\n\n\"Together we can make possibility something that every child can count on,\" Michael Dell said in a December video announcing the contribution.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio is \"adopting\" the state of Connecticut.\n\nThe Bridgewater Associates founder and his wife Barbara are planning to contribute $250 to the Trump Accounts of about 300,000 children across the state.\n\nThe contributions will be initially targeted toward children under the age of 10 who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000.\n\n\"Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction,\" Dalio said in a statement in December. \"I have lived the American Dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life.\"\n\nHarold Hamm, the founder and chairman of the petroleum company Continental Resources, plans to \"adopt\" the state of Oklahoma, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nThe details of Hamm's planned contributions have not yet been made public, and spokespeople for Continental Resources did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHamm, a billionaire, contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Donald Trump's campaign in 2024.\n\nEven Nicki Minaj says she's contributing to Trump Accounts.\n\nMinaj has indicated that the contributions will go to her fans, but it's not clear how much money she's pouring in.\n\nThe New York Post reported in January that it could be \"between $150,000 and $300,000,\" but that the number was still in flux. A representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinaj said on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast that she became interested when she saw President Trump speaking about the accounts alongside Michael Dell.\n\n\"I was just like, wow. Like, I love this idea,\" Minaj said.\n\n\"My big thing is financial literacy,\" she added. \"You could teach a person everything in the world, but if they don't know how to manage money, if they don't know what the financial world really entails, then they'll get it and lose it.\"",

    "description": "Wall Street's preeminent valuation yardstick offers a worrisome tale for investors.",
    "fullText": "From an investment standpoint, Wall Street is a fan of Donald Trump in the White House. During President Trump's first term in office, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-fueled Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) gained 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nIn the year and change since he was inaugurated for his second, non-consecutive term, an encore Trump bull market rally has taken shape. From Jan. 20, 2025, through the closing bell on Feb. 10, 2026, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have, respectively, rallied 15%, 16%, and 18%. Outsize returns have become something of the norm.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are behind this exceptionally strong bull market, some of which can be attributed to Donald Trump, there are also headwinds that can derail this rally. One insurmountable obstacle that has over 150 years of history in its sails is of particular concern.\n\nTo get a bit of housekeeping out of the way, Wall Street's major indexes climbing is nothing new. Since March 1897, there have been 33 presidential terms, 26 of which resulted in a positive return in either the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. Most presidents oversee a growing U.S. economy and investment optimism, leading to stock market gains during their tenure -- and Trump has been no exception.\n\nHowever, the early annualized return for President Trump's second term is among the best of any president dating back well over a century. As investors, it pays to understand what's behind this outsize return.\n\nNot all of the stock market's upside catalysts have been influenced by the president. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), which began during Joe Biden's presidency, and the advent of quantum computing are playing key roles in lifting the broader market. Analysts at PwC believe AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, while Boston Consulting Group estimates quantum computing will create up to $850 billion in global economic value by 2040. These technologies are clearly exciting investors.\n\nLikewise, President Trump had no hand in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates on six occasions since September 2024. Lowering lending rates can encourage corporate borrowing, in turn leading to an increase in hiring, acquisition activity, and capital devoted to innovation.",

But it also proposes sharply raising some annual out-of-pocket costs — to more than $27,000 for one type of coverage — and could cause up to 2 million people to drop insurance.\n\nThe changes come as affordability is a key concern for many Americans, some of whom are struggling to pay their ACA premiums since enhanced subsidies expired at the end of last year. Initial enrollment numbers for this year fell by more than 1 million.\n\nHealth care coverage and affordability have become politically potent issues in the run-up to November’s midterm elections.\n\nThe proposed changes are part of a lengthy rule that addresses a broad swath of standards, including benefit packages, out-of-pocket costs, and health care provider networks. Insurers refer to these standards when setting premium rates for the coming year.\n\nAfter a comment period, the rule will be finalized this spring.\n\nIt “puts patients, taxpayers, and states first by lowering costs and reinforcing accountability for taxpayer dollars,” said Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz in a Feb. 9 press release.\n\nOne way it would do so focuses heavily on a type of coverage — catastrophic plans — that last year attracted only about 20,000 policyholders, according to the proposal, although other estimates put it closer to 54,000.\n\n“To me, this proposal reads like the administration has found their next big thing in the catastrophic plans,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nSuch plans have very high annual out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder but often lower premiums than other ACA coverage options. Formerly restricted to those under age 30 or facing certain hardships, the Trump administration allowed older people who lost subsidy eligibility to enroll in them for this year. It is not yet known how many people chose to do so.\n\nThe payment rule cements this move by making eligible anyone whose income is below the poverty line ($15,650 for this year) and those earning more than 2.5 times that amount who lost access to an ACA subsidy that lowered their out-of-pocket costs. It also notes that a person meeting these standards would be eligible in any state — an important point because this coverage is currently available in only 36 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn addition, the proposal would require out-of-pocket maximums on such plans to hit $15,600 a year for an individual and $27,600 for a family, Keith wrote this week in Health Affairs. (The current out-of-pocket max for catastrophic plans is $10,600 for an individual plan and $21,200 for family coverage.) Not counting preventive care and three covered primary care doctor visits, that spending target must be met before a policy’s other coverage kicks in.\n\nIn the rule, the administration wrote that the proposed changes would help differentiate catastrophic from “bronze” plans, the next level up, and, possibly, spur more enrollment in the former. Currently, the proposal said, there may not be a significant difference if premiums are similar. Raising the out-of-pocket maximum for catastrophic plans to those levels would create that difference, the proposal said.\n\n“When there is such a clear difference, the healthier consumers that are generally eligible and best suited to enroll in catastrophic plans are more motivated to select a catastrophic plan in lieu of a bronze plan,” the proposal noted.\n\nHowever, ACA subsidies cannot be used toward catastrophic premiums, which could limit shoppers’ interest.\n\nEnrollment in bronze plans, which currently have an average annual deductible of $7,500, has doubled since 2018 to about 5.4 million last year. This year, that number will likely be higher. Some states’ sign-up data indicates a shift toward bronze as consumers left higher-premium “silver,” “gold,” or “platinum” plans following the expiration of more generous subsidies at the end of last year.\n\nThe proposal also would allow insurers to offer bronze plans with cost-sharing rates that exceed what the ACA law currently allows, but only if that insurer also sells other bronze plans with lower cost-sharing levels.\n\nIn what it calls a “novel” approach, the proposal would allow insurers to offer multiyear catastrophic plans, in which people could stay enrolled for up to 10 years, and their out-of-pocket maximums would vary over that time. Costs might be higher, for example, in the early years, then fall the longer the policy is in place. The proposal specifically asks for comments on how such a plan could be structured and what effect multiyear plans might have on the overall market.\n\n“As we understand it thus far, insurers could offer the policy for one year or for consecutive years, up to 10 years,” said Zach Sherman, managing director for coverage policy and program design at HMA, also known as Health Management Associates, a health policy consulting firm that does work for states and insurance plans. “But the details on how that would work, we are still unpacking.”\n\nMatthew Fiedler, senior fellow with the Center on Health Policy at the Brookings Institution, said the proposed rule included a lot of provisions that could “expose enrollees to much higher out-of-pocket costs.”\n\nIn addition to the planned changes to bronze and catastrophic plans, he points to another provision that would allow plans to be sold on the ACA exchange that have no set health care provider networks. In other words, the insurer has not contracted with specific doctors and hospitals to accept their coverage. Instead, such plans would pay medical providers a set amount toward medical services, possibly a flat fee or a percentage of what Medicare pays, for example. The rule says insurers would need to ensure “access to a range of providers” willing to accept such amounts as payment in full. Policyholders might be on the hook for unexpected expenses, however, if a clinician or facility doesn’t agree and charges the patient the difference.\n\nBecause the rule is so sweeping — with many other parts — it is expected to draw hundreds, if not thousands, of comments between now and early March.\n\nPennsylvania insurance broker Joshua Brooker said one change he would like to see is requiring insurers that sell the very high out-of-pocket catastrophic plans to offer other catastrophic plans with lower annual maximums.\n\nOverall, though, a wider range of options might appeal to people on both ends of the income scale, he said.\n\nSome wealthier enrollees, especially those who no longer qualify for any ACA premium subsidies, would prefer a lower premium like those expected in catastrophic plans, and could just pay the bills up to that max, he said.\n\n“They’re more worried about the half-million-dollar heart attack,” Brooker said. It’s tougher for people below the poverty level, who don’t qualify for ACA subsidies and, in 10 states, often don’t qualify for Medicaid. So they’re likely to go uninsured. At least a catastrophic plan, he said, might let them get some preventive care coverage and cap their exposure if they end up in a hospital. From there, they might qualify for charity care at the hospital to cover out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOverall, “putting more options on the market doesn’t hurt, as long as it is disclosed properly and the consumer understands it,” he said.\n\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

    "fullText": "Bill Maher eviscerated President Donald Trump over the “biggest dick move in American history,” following the rolling back of climate change regulations.\n\nOn the Friday, February 13 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the late-night host, 70, took aim at the POTUS, 79, over his remarks — and recent actions — involving global warming.\n\n“Trump has always said it’s a hoax, the whole thing with climate change,” Maher explained. “He said, scientists, he says, are ‘stupid people.’ He says, the idea that greenhouse gases cause climate change, there’s no basis in fact.”\n\nThat’s when the stand-up comedian pointed out, “He thinks it’s just some bulls*** that people made up out of nothing to get rich. You know, like crypto.”\n\nOn February 12, the Trump administration rescinded a 2009 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declaration stating that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are a danger to public health. The Associated Press reported that the repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for vehicles and could result in a larger repeal of climate regulations on things like power plants and oil and gas facilities.\n\nOf the move, Maher said, “And, yes, his EPA director, Lee Zeldin, said this is the single, this is a quote, ‘single largest deregulatory action in American history.'”\n\nHe then bluntly declared, “Probably true. Also the biggest dick move in American history.”\n\nIn September 2025, Trump slammed the concept of climate change during a speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” the POTUS said, per PBS. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”\n\nReal Time With Bill Maher, Fridays at 10/9c, HBO\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",
