    "description": "The president issued a raft of clemency grants this week, including pardoning a woman he had given relief to once before and a man whose daughter had donated millions to a Trump super PAC.",
    "fullText": "In 2021, a convicted fraudster named Adriana Camberos was freed from prison when President Trump commuted her sentence.\n\nRather than taking advantage of that second chance, prosecutors said, Ms. Camberos returned to crime. She and her brother were convicted in 2024 in an unrelated fraud.\n\nThis week, Mr. Trump pardoned both siblings, marking the second time he had opened the prison gates for Ms. Camberos.\n\nTheir pardons were among a handful of clemency grants quietly issued by Mr. Trump on Thursday and Friday.\n\nAmong the other lucky recipients: a man whose daughter had given millions to a Trump-backed super PAC, a former governor of Puerto Rico and a former F.B.I. agent — all of whom had pleaded guilty in a political corruption case.\n\nThe pardons, most of which have not been previously reported, were supported by people with close ties to Mr. Trump’s orbit, including lawyers who had worked for him.\n\nThey continue a trend in which Mr. Trump has used the unfettered presidential clemency power to reward allies and those who have paid his associates or donated to his political operation. The approach stands in contrast to Justice Department guidelines that prioritize the clemency applications of people who have completed their prison sentences or demonstrated remorse and a lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe pardons, several of which forgave white-collar crimes and frauds by affluent perpetrators, strike a discordant note with the Trump administration’s announcement that it was suspending federal funding for programs intended to serve poor people in Minnesota in order to root out fraud.\n\nA White House official justified the clemency grants in a statement as rectifying excessive sentences or prosecutions that were politically motivated to target Trump supporters. The official, who was not authorized to discuss the clemency grants on the record, suggested that Mr. Trump made the clemency decisions based on the merits, not whether the recipients had political connections or had made donations to groups he supports.\n\nThree of the recipients were scheduled to be sentenced this month in a political corruption case related to accusations that former Gov. Wanda Vázquez of Puerto Rico had accepted bribes from Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian banker, in 2020.\n\nIn late 2024, while Mr. Herrera was facing felony bribery and other charges in the case, his daughter, Isabela Herrera, donated $2.5 million to MAGA Inc., a super PAC devoted to Mr. Trump and run by his allies.\n\nIn May, her father’s lawyer, Christopher M. Kise, who had served on Mr. Trump’s legal defense team, negotiated an unusually lenient deal with the Justice Department. Under the deal, which was authorized by a top Trump appointee, Mr. Herrera agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor campaign finance charge, disappointing career prosecutors who had pushed for a harsher sentence.\n\nIn July, Ms. Herrera donated another $1 million to MAGA Inc. She did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump this week pardoned Mr. Herrera, Ms. Vázquez and Mark Rossini, a former F.B.I. agent who had worked as a consultant for Mr. Herrera. All three had pleaded guilty in August to misdemeanor campaign finance charges.\n\nThe White House official denied that Ms. Herrera’s donations had played any role in her father’s pardon. Instead, the official suggested that pardon and the others related to the Puerto Rico case were motivated by a belief that the investigation into the matter was retribution for Ms. Vázquez’s endorsement of Mr. Trump in 2020.\n\nMr. Herrera “is profoundly grateful” to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kise said in a statement.\n\nLawyers for Ms. Vázquez and Mr. Rossini did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs for Ms. Camberos, she was among a number of people granted clemency by Mr. Trump who have been charged with new crimes after receiving a second chance.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nMs. Camberos began serving a 26-month prison sentence in December 2019 for her role in a scheme to sell millions of counterfeit bottles of the caffeinated drink 5-Hour Energy. Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in the final days of his first term after she enlisted two lawyers with connections in his orbit. One of them, Stefan C. Passantino, had been a deputy White House counsel in the first Trump administration. Another, Adam Katz, represented Rudolph W. Giuliani in a defamation case related to his effort to overturn Mr. Trump’s loss in the 2020 election.\n\nBut soon after her release from prison, she and her brother Andres embarked on a new fraud, federal prosecutors in California said. The siblings were charged in 2023 in a complicated scheme: They bought consumer goods from manufacturers at a steep discount, purportedly to sell them in Mexico — a legal practice. Instead, prosecutors said, the siblings sold the goods in the United States at higher prices and then committed bank and mail fraud to cover their tracks.\n\nThey were convicted in 2024. In April, Ms. Camberos was sentenced to more than one year in prison — 12 months for the new conviction and additional months for violating her probation on her earlier conviction — and Andres Camberos was given one year of home confinement. Ms. Camberos had begun serving her sentence.\n\nThey were ordered to pay millions of dollars in restitution to the companies they defrauded.\n\nThe White House official did not respond to a question about whether the pardon would wipe away the Camberos siblings’ restitution payments, but pardons typically erase financial penalties.\n\nThe siblings’ supporters had argued privately that they were targeted by prosecutors because Mr. Trump had wiped away Ms. Camberos’s sentence from her earlier conviction — a claim echoed by the White House official.\n\nMr. Passantino and Mr. Katz had worked to secure pardons for the siblings, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.\n\nThe two lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. Marcus Bourassa, another lawyer for Ms. Camberos, said in a statement that his client was wrongfully convicted and is grateful to the President and others for their support.\n\nMr. Katz also had supported clemency for Terren S. Peizer, a former business executive who had been convicted in 2024 of insider trading and sentenced last year to 42 months in prison. Mr. Peizer was also ordered to pay a fine of $5.25 million and forfeit more than $12.7 million. He was pardoned on Friday by Mr. Trump.\n\nDavid Willingham, a lawyer for Mr. Peizer, said in a statement that the case was a “massive overreach” by the government.\n\nAnother statement issued on behalf of Mr. Peizer himself said that “there aren’t enough words to express the gratitude and appreciation I have for the compassion and recognition of this unfair process by the most accomplished president of my lifetime, and perhaps beyond.”\n\nThe White House official said that Mr. Peizer’s case was an example of excessive prosecution and that he had properly disclosed the trades.\n\nAnother finance executive who received a pardon, David Levy, was convicted by a jury in 2019 for his role in a scheme to defraud bondholders while he was the co-chief investment officer of a New York hedge fund. In a statement issued after the conviction, a federal official who oversaw part of the investigation called the verdict “a warning for all the fraudsters out there: No matter how slick you think you are, liars, frauds and cheats never win.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump also signed eight commutations, which cut short sentences but do not necessarily wipe away other penalties related to convictions.\n\nMost went to people convicted of drug offenses, including James P. Womack, the son of Representative Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who is a Trump ally.\n\nThe younger Mr. Womack had pleaded guilty in 2023 to distributing methamphetamine, and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nHis father, who in November cited a family member’s serious medical issue, thanked Mr. Trump in a statement on Friday “for this gracious and thoughtful action.” The commutation, Mr. Womack said, “has allowed my son to be with his family during a profoundly difficult time.”\n\nAnother commutation went to Jacob Deutsch, who had been sentenced to 62 months in prison in 2024 for his role in a mortgage fraud scheme.\n\nHis clemency grant was supported by the Tzedek Association, a Jewish group that was influential in shaping Mr. Trump’s clemency grants and criminal justice policies during his first term.\n\nThe group, which posted an apparent copy of the signed commutation on social media, contended that the sentence was too harsh and thanked Mr. Trump for affirming mercy “as a cornerstone of American justice.”",

    "description": "Trump and a group of northeastern governors are pressuring a major power grid operator to hold a new auction.",
    "fullText": "The AI data center boom is driving up electricity prices. President Donald Trump is leaning on a power company to fix it.\n\nTrump and a group of governors from northeastern states are calling on PJM Interconnection, the nation's largest power grid operator, to hold a new power auction.\n\nThe goal is to allow major tech companies to foot the bill for new power plants. According to a release from the Department of Interior, a \"coalition of leading technology companies\" has committed to funding new generation capacity, though no companies are named.\n\n\"Make no mistake, if PJM, this faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change, and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act, and forced to go at it alone,\" Gov. Josh Shapiro said at an event for the announcement, according to Politico.\n\nThe Trump administration and the governors are also urging PJM to make a series of other changes, according to a Department of Energy fact sheet. Those changes include:\n\nPJM operates in 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest. Representatives for the company were not present at the Friday event.\n\n\"We don't have a lot to say on this,\" PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg on Thursday. \"We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.\"\n\nIn a statement on Friday, Shields did not immediately commit to the White House's directives.\n\n\"PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. The PJM Board's decision, resulting from a multi-month stakeholder process on integrating large load additions, will be released later today,\" Shields said. \"The Board has been deliberating on this issue since the end of that stakeholder process. We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board's decision.\"\n\nAri Peskoe, the director of the Electricity Law Initiative at the Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program, told Business Insider that it's unclear whether the administration's approach will work.\n\n\"The intent here is correct, which is to appreciate that data centers are driving up prices in PJM, and an attempt to remedy that for consumers,\" Peskoe said. \"It is meant to isolate data centers from the rest of the market, and, in theory, that seems like a workable approach; but these markets are really complicated, and it's hard to predict how this all shakes out.\"\n\nTrump has been making a broader push for tech companies to pay for the electricity consumed by new data centers in a bid to lower energy costs for consumers.\n\n\"My Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday, adding that tech companies must \"pay their own way.\"\n\nMicrosoft on Tuesday released a plan that includes asking utility companies to set higher rates for the company in order to keep costs down for consumers. Other major tech companies could follow a similar path.",

    "fullText": "A reporter confronted President Donald Trump Friday afternoon over his acceptance of a gift award that he did not win, asking “Why would you want somebody else’s Nobel Prize?”\n\nTrump has been foreshadowing that he would be honored to accept the Nobel Peace Prize from 2025 recipient María Corina Machado. After reporting that suggested her failure to refuse the prize contributed to Trump’s decision not to support her, Machado told Sean Hannity she’d love to give her award to the president.\n\nMachado and Trump closed the deal on Thursday at the White House, although the honor that goes with the award is non-transferable.\n\nThe president took questions from reporters on the North Lawn of the White House as he made his way to Marine One on his way to Mar-a-Lago, and was asked about his used award:\n\nREPORTER: Yesterday, yesterday you accepted Maria Machado’s Nobel Prize medal. What do you intend to do with it? And why would you want someone else’s Nobel Prize?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, she offered it to me. I thought it was very nice. She said, you know, you’ve had eight wars and nobody deserves this prize more than in history than you do. And I thought that was a very nice gesture. And by the way, I think she’s a very fine woman and we’ll be talking again.\n\nREPORTER: You just called Machado a very nice person. He said the meeting went well. Why align with Delci Rodriguez and the remnants of the Maduro regime and not with Machado who has the support of the Venezuelan people?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, if you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired, every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired, and they ended up being ISIS. Instead of just getting down to business, they ended being ISIS, so I remember that.\n\nBut I’ll tell you, I had a great meeting yesterday by a person who I have a lot of respect for.\n\nAnd she has respect, obviously, for me and our country. And she gave me her Nobel Prize.\n\nBut I’ll tell you what, I got to know her. I never met her before. And I was very, very impressed. She’s a really, this is a fine woman.\n\nThe post Trump Confronted to His Face Over Nobel Yoink: ‘Why Would You Want Somebody Else’s Nobel Prize?’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "title": "Anthony Scaramucci thinks Trump’s ‘hard-left’ move to cap credit-card fees is because he’s ‘texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani’",
    "description": "The \"mooch\" says it really shows a pivot to \"full nihilism.\" His podcast guest, longtime GOP strategist Stuart Stevens, called it \"darkly hysterical.\"",
    "fullText": "In a provocative assessment of the current political landscape, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci claims President Donald Trump has entered a “full nihilism mode,” evidenced by a recent proposal to cap credit-card interest rates at 10%. Speaking on his podcast, The Rest Is Politics US, Scaramucci characterized the move as a “hard-left populist” maneuver that aligns more closely with democratic socialists than traditional Republican orthodoxy.\n\nScaramucci suggested the policy shift is so radical it feels as though Trump is “texting back and forth with Mayor Mamdani,” referencing recent reporting in Axios that Trump and the recently elected democratic socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, have been texting since they met at the White House in November.\n\n“This is a hard-left populist thing to do,” he said, though he was quick to point out Trump lacks the unilateral authority to implement such a change. He explained such a cap would require congressional approval and would have to navigate the complex regulatory hurdles of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nSince 2022, interest rates on credit cards has skyroketed, hitting a record high in August 2024. There are a number of reasons why; the Federal Reserve’s campaign to hike interest rates to combat inflation after the pandemic increased the Federal Funds Rate, which is tied to most credit cards’ rates. But Trump and other critics more have blamed credit card companies’ own greed as they extracted more money on top of the rate set by the Federal Funds.\n\nIn 2024, the gap between the typical credit card interest rates and the rates that companies were issuing had the widest gap in history. That allowed large credit card issuers to generate returns on assets six times higher or more than their other banking activities.\n\nMeanwhile, evidence is piling up American consumers are under growing financial strain. Last April, a record number of Americans, 11%, met only the minimum requirement payment on their credit card bill. Consumer debt broadly surged in 2025, with the first three months of the year marking the highest level of debt delinquency since the pandemic.\n\nThis has put Trump in company with more Mamdani-like figures, namely Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But the cap is popular among politicians across the aisle. Senators Sanders and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bill last year that would cap credit card interest rates at 10% for five years. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Trump had called her about the proposal this week. \n\nBut it is a nightmare for banks, which have been hammering away on the media cycle arguing the cap would actually cause stricter credit, meaning less people will get access to credit cards.\n\n“An artificial cap on credit card interest rates is likely to backfire on the White House by making credit less accessible to the cash-strapped households that most need it,” Columbia Business School economics professor Brett House told Fortune.\n\nTrump, however, has shown little hesitation in embracing populist policies that unsettle the business community. His second term has been marked by unusually direct executive intervention in markets, often to the discomfort of corporate America.\n\nJoining Scaramucci was veteran Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, former campaign advisor to Mitt Romney, who argued the proposal is a symptom of a larger identity crisis within the GOP. Stevens asserted there is essentially “no conservative party in America today,” noting the party has traded ideological philosophy for a series of “marketing slogans.”\n\nTo Stevens, it was “darkly hysterical” the Republican Party opposes Mamdani’s ascension so much while Trump’s own policies look more classically socialist, first in taking a direct stake in semiconductor champion Intel and now in proposing a cap on interest rates.\n\n“Your socialism is not as good as our socialism,” Stevens said, highlighting what he views as a hypocritical shift toward big-government interventionism.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.",
    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.\n\nTrump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.”\n\nDuring an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\n\n“I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said.\n\nHe had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.\n\nEarlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThat encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.\n\nEuropean leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.\n\nA relationship that ‘we need to nurture’\n\nIn Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\n\nDelegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group’s hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that’s what you’re hearing with this delegation.”\n\nThe tone contrasted with that emanating from the White House. Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The White House hasn’t ruled out taking the territory by force.\n\n“We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday’s meetings. “And mostly, I would say the threats that we’re seeing right now is from the U.S. side.”\n\nMurkowski emphasized the role of Congress in spending and in conveying messages from constituents.\n\n“I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said.\n\nAlong with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally’s consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council.\n\nInuit council criticizes White House statements\n\nThe dispute is looming large in the lives of Greenlanders. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.””\n\nThe chair of the Nuuk, Greenland-based Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents around 180,000 Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia’s Chukotka region on international issues, said persistent statements from the White House that the U.S. must own Greenland offer “a clear picture of how the US administration views the people of Greenland, how the U.S. administration views Indigenous peoples, and peoples that are few in numbers.”\n\nSara Olsvig told The Associated Press in Nuuk that the issue is “how one of the biggest powers in the world views other peoples that are less powerful than them. And that really is concerning.”\n\nIndigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.\n\nSuperville reported from Washington.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press journalist Serra Yedikardes contributed to this story from Kapikoy Border Crossing, Turkey.",

    "description": "The Venezuelan opposition leader’s efforts to share her award with the U.S. president have shaken some Norwegians’ faith in their signature soft-power tool.",
    "fullText": "María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, presented her prize to President Trump on Thursday during a meeting in the White House.\n\nMr. Trump took to social media several hours later to thank her.\n\n“María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done,” he wrote. “Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!”\n\nThe White House shared on social media an image of Mr. Trump holding the frame containing the Nobel medal. The inscription reads that his “Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela” has been recognized. The Nobel Committee has said the Peace Prize is not transferable.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Machado, speaking to reporters earlier after meeting with Mr. Trump, said she had made the presentation “as a recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom.”\n\nThe highly unusual gesture came after months of clamoring by the American president that he had deserved the prize that she was awarded for seeking to usher a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela.\n\nMs. Machado had repeatedly dedicated the prize to Mr. Trump and praised the U.S. military operation nearly two weeks ago that ousted Venezuela’s longtime authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mr. Trump has made clear that he thought he had deserved the prize, saying he had ended several wars and castigating Norway for overlooking him.\n\nBeyond cheering U.S. intervention in her country, Ms. Machado has remained mum about a bombing campaign against boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs. The American strikes have killed more than 100 people.\n\nIt is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump. After ousting Mr. Maduro, he declined to install her in power, saying that “she’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect” needed to lead the country.\n\nIndependently verified vote counts in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election showed that Ms. Machado’s party had beaten Mr. Maduro by a wide margin. The Venezuelan authorities, nonetheless, declared Mr. Maduro the victor, and his government embarked on a harsh repression campaign against critics of the outcome.\n\nSpeaking to supporters and reporters in Washington on Thursday, Ms. Machado said she was “impressed” by how clear Mr. Trump was on her country’s situation and “how much he cares.”\n\nHer efforts to cozy up to Mr. Trump have been met with scorn across the Atlantic Ocean in Norway, where the prize is regarded not just as prestigious and freighted with symbolism, but also as the country’s primary soft-power tool — and where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. The Nobel Institute, which awards it, has been in serious damage-control mode.\n\nLast Friday, after Ms. Machado floated the idea of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview, the institute offered a reminder about what the rules governing the award allow, saying that the facts were “clear and well established.”\n\n“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the institute wrote. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”\n\nThe day before Ms. Machado arrived in Washington, Kristian Harpviken, the director of the institute, who is also the secretary of the committee that chooses award recipients, said he would not be drawn further into the deepening controversy.\n\n“The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate’s contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken,” he said.\n\nThat explanation has been insufficient for many Norwegians.\n\n“A Nobel committee can never guard against peace prize laureates committing acts that run counter to the intention of the prize,’’ Lena Lindgren, a columnist for the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet, said in an interview. “But what is new now is that the prize is being used in a political game, a warlike game.”\n\nMs. Machado’s trip to Washington also drew derision from those now in power in Venezuela. Speaking in Caracas on Thursday, Venezuela’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, who gained the Trump administration’s support in taking over after Mr. Maduro’s ouster, took aim at Ms. Machado in a thinly veiled reference.\n\n“And if one day, as acting president, I have to go to Washington, I will do so with my head held high, not on my knees,” she said.\n\nIt is far from the first time the Nobel committee has been criticized for its choice, or been accused of abetting violent leaders or governments.\n\nGlobal outrage followed the choice of President Barack Obama, who at the time was presiding over military engagements on several continents.\n\nAnd less than a year after receiving the award, Abiy Ahmed, the president of Ethiopia, embarked on a scorched-earth campaign in his country’s Tigray region that left hundreds of thousands dead, wounded and starving. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the prize before a cease-fire to end the Vietnam War broke down, with Mr. Kissinger ultimately trying to return the prize amid a wave of protests. His North Vietnamese counterpart rejected it outright.\n\nWhat makes the dispute swirling around Ms. Machado unusual, according to Asle Sveen, a former researcher at the Nobel Institute, is Norwegians’ particularly dim view of Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Machado “has dedicated her Peace Prize to a highly controversial president, to put it mildly,” Mr. Sveen said. “It is nearly universally accepted in Norway that Donald Trump attacks liberal democracy.”\n\nA Norwegian tabloid, Nettavisen, conducted a poll before the announcement of the award that found three-quarters of respondents were against it being bestowed on Mr. Trump, even if he were instrumental in orchestrating a peace agreement in Ukraine or Gaza.\n\n“The Nobel Committee has compromised the prize” by not foreseeing how Ms. Machado and Mr. Trump would use it to justify military intervention in Venezuela, Ms. Lindgren said. “Norway has been politically embarrassed and has failed to manage the symbolic capital.”\n\nFollowing the 2024 election in Venezuela, Ms. Machado went into hiding for more than a year. In December, she secretly left Venezuela to receive her award in Norway. She missed the award ceremony but appeared in Oslo to greet supporters. Her escape was orchestrated by a company run by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence training.\n\nAmerican lawmakers, including Marco Rubio, who was then a Republican senator from Florida and is now Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, had written a letter to the Nobel Committee in 2024 advocating that they award Ms. Machado the peace prize.\n\nThey noted her “peaceful resistance to tyrants” and her “unwavering moral compass,” and said that her efforts showed the “urgent need for international solidarity in the face of aggressive and expansive authoritarianism.”\n\nThere is little doubt that Ms. Machado has long risked her safety to challenge an authoritarian government that jails opponents, tortures critics and censors the press. But she has also embraced Mr. Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, repeated debunked claims that Mr. Maduro manipulated U.S. elections, and parroted the Trump administration’s claim that Mr. Maduro simultaneously led two drug organizations, despite scant evidence.\n\nHer assertions fueled accusations that she was amplifying misinformation in what, until now, seemed a failed attempt to gain the American president’s support.\n\nStill, not all Norwegians agree that the award to Ms. Machado was a mistake.\n\nIf it turned out that she supported the U.S. boat strikes, that would not be the best reflection on a laureate, said Marianne Dahl, research director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo. But Ms. Machado was awarded for her pro-democracy work in 2024, Ms. Dahl said. She drew similarities between Ms. Machado and past winners who led popular movements in Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Soviet republics, as well as during the so-called Arab Spring.\n\n“It is easy to sit in comfortable Norway and criticize her for talking sweet to Trump,” Ms. Dahl said.\n\nThat, she noted, is exactly what many European and even Norwegian leaders have done. “And they don’t have a repressive regime pursuing them, as Machado has had,” she said.\n\nJack Nicas and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.",

    "fullText": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was accused of “gaslighting” Americans and engaging in “hypocrisy” after she voiced outrage over images of Minneapolis protesters giving their middle fingers to cameras.\n\nTrump administration critics noted that Leavitt’s statement, during her daily news briefing Thursday, came a day after the White House downplayed the president flipping off a Ford plant employee.\n\nLeavitt accused liberal “people in power” of encouraging the protesters in Minneapolis, whom she referred to as “left-wing agitators.”\n\n“If you look at some of the images out of Minneapolis last night. Look at this vehicle, look at what it says: It says ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger -- proudly so -- at the camera,” Leavitt said.\n\n“People don’t do this without encouragement from people in power who make it feel like it’s O.K.,” the press secretary continued.\n\nTrump critics raised their eyebrows over Leavitt’s remarks, sharing photos of the president giving the middle finger.\n\n“Who wants to tell her?” said liberal influencer Joanne Carducci, who tweets under the name JoJoFromJerz.\n\n“This is so rich given her boss did the exact same thing this week. Oh wait, but that was ‘an appropriate response,’ coming from the President,” tweeted another X user. “The hypocrisy and gaslighting with these people is so off the charts that I think they’re starting to truly believe their own lies.”\n\nOf Leavitt, another user said, “Is she this braindead?”\n\nThe White House press secretary addressed the media hours after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the protests.\n\n“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump stated in a post on his Truth Social profile.\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807, which authorizes the president to deploy the U.S. military in America in response to domestic unrest, was last used by then-President George H.W. Bush, who got the support to use the act by local officials.",

    "fullText": "President Trump giving the middle-finger to a Ford employee who apparently calls it like he sees it seems to be the best thing that has ever happened to him — financially at least. TJ Sabula, a 40-year old United Auto Workers Local 600 line worker, was quickly suspended with pay by Ford after heckling the President while he was visiting one of its factories in Michigan (the President, in turn, flipped him the bird and apparently mouthed \"F**k you.\") But, soon after, a pair of GoFundMe pages were set up for Sabula and they took off like wildfire.\n\nAs of mid-morning on January 15, the pair of campaigns for Sabula have raised $811,010 from nearly 35,000 separate donations. Sabula, seeming to be a stand-up guy, actually decided to stop accepting donations, indicating he and his family had more than enough.\n\nIn an update on one of the pages, Sabula wrote, \"We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support!

I'm not sure I'm big enough to ever stop taking free money, but good for him.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't just pick a random guy out of the crowd to cuss out, though it wouldn't be that surprising. Sabula reportedly called Trump a \"pedophile protector\" during his visit to the Michigan F-150 factory. The Department of Justice faces criticisms as to the speed it has released the Epstein files–along with the redactions being made to the documents–which must be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nIn any case, as we previously reported, Trump's White House didn't try to cover up or downplay what the President did, instead telling the Washington Post that \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n\nSabula told The Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever,\" though he did add that he feels concerned about the future of his job and believes he has been \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what Sabula's future with Ford will be, but at the very least the $800,000+ he's gotten from GoFundMe will help lighten the blow. On top of that, he's got the backing of the UAW. The union posted this on its website:\n\nThe autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union —the UAW. He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\n\nThe UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member. Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone—including the President of the United States.\n\nThat's certainly the type of union representation we all deserve.\n\nSabula has also received support from U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, who represents Detroit, calling him a \"national hero,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and fellow Michigander Pete Buttigieg has also voiced his support.\n\nNot everyone was on board, though, including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, who earlier in the visit said meeting the president was \"the experience of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Discipline is in the hands of the organization. It's unfortunate and 99% of the employees in the plant were great and I was embarrassed because we're the host. But that was six seconds out of an hour tour and the tour went great.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns can often get people all riled up about someone being rewarded for \"bad behavior\": In early 2025, a woman in Minnesota was caught calling a child a racist slur on a playground and then made over $800,000 on GoFundMe-alike site GiveSendGo, according to NBC News. That woman was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct by the City of Rochester, with a trial set to begin in August 2026, ABC 6 News reports.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "Greenland Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Motzfeldt teared up as she discussed a Wednesday meeting with President Donald Trump over his threats to acquire Greenland.\n\n“We have been working very hard in our department, even though there are not many of us,” Motzfeldt said, per a translation by Clash Report, during an interview with Greenland’s Kalaallit Nunaata Radio on Wednesday.\n\nHer reaction comes after she and Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen met with Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House. The group came together in an effort to address Trump’s pursuit of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“I would not normally like to say these words, but I will say them: We are very strong,” Motzfeldt said. “We are doing our utmost. But the last days, naturally… Oh, I am getting very emotional. I am overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added: “The last days have been tough. Our preparations and the increasing pressure that has been intense. But I want to say, we are strong in the government. The work is to ensure the the Greenlandic people in our country can feel safe and live securely. We are using all our strength to achieve this as we continue the work.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump hasn’t let up on his desire to take over Greenland. During an interview with press, per Politico, Rasmussen said he and his team hit a roadblock with Trump over the region.\n\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen said Wednesday. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland. We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe post Greenland Official Chokes Up After Trump Meeting Over US Acquisition Talk: ‘I Am Overwhelmed’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "The advice from five legal experts boiled down to a blunt workplace reality: employees should watch their mouth if they want to keep their job.",
    "fullText": "Hours after President Donald Trump toured a Ford pickup truck assembly plant, the big news story wasn't about manufacturing jobs or the economy. It was about a Ford worker who heckled him and was later suspended.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the limits of free speech in the workplace — and when companies can discipline workers for political protest.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to five experts, including four employment lawyers and an HR executive, to find out.\n\nTheir conclusion was blunt: an employee's words can quickly become fireable offenses.\n\nAll four lawyers said workers retain legal free speech rights under the Constitution, but those rights rarely protect speech in their workplace.\n\n\"With very few exceptions, employees in the private sector don't have free speech rights at work,\" Mark Kluger, a co-founding partner at New Jersey-based law firm Kluger Healey, told Business Insider.\n\nJessica Childress, a managing attorney at Washington, DC-based The Childress Firm, said workers often confuse who the First Amendment actually applies to. The best way to think about it, she said, is to divide government action from a private company's authority.\n\n\"The First Amendment's right to freedom of speech only applies to government actors, not private employers, such as Ford,\" she said. \"A private company can — with certain exceptions — limit what their employees say.\"\n\nThat distinction has played out in real-world cases before.\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman, a former marketing analyst for a government contractor, was fired from her job after professional photographers caught her giving Trump's motorcade the middle finger.\n\nEven though her action happened outside of the office, her lawsuit against her employer was tossed.\n\n\"Employers are legally allowed to regulate behavior that disrupts the workplace,\" said Jared Pope, an employment law attorney and CEO at Work Shield. \"That is why most organizations apply their codes of conduct consistently, even when speech happens off the clock or references public figures.\"\n\nStill, lawyers said workers generally have more protection if they express their political belief off-the-clock.\n\n\"If you are so inclined to protest, do it off-duty, off-premises, and off-company networks,\" Eric Kingsley, a partner at Kingsley Szamet Employment Lawyers, told Business Insider. \"An employer has the ability to discipline an employee for speech in matters of politics when it becomes misconduct.\"\n\nEach lawyer we talked to said that Ford was well within its rights to suspend the employee, T.J. Sabula.\n\nIn fact, some said the automaker may have displayed restraint by not outright firing the factory employee after the decision.\n\n\"It implies Ford is buying time,\" Kingsley added. \"Suspending the employee gives them a chance to investigate and make a decision that may not be as rash as laying off an employee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Auto Workers, the union representing the workers in Sabula's plant, confirmed his suspension. Sabula, who has said he doesn't regret heckling Trump and is set to receive over $800,000 in crowdfunded support, has not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaura Dickerson, a vice president for the UAW, said the union was reviewing Ford's actions and said workers \"should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe union also said Sabula \"believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nFord declined to comment on the suspension, saying it was \"a personnel matter.\"\n\n\"Ford is navigating a high-profile, politically charged moment,\" Lauren Winans, CEO of the HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, said. \"The union's involvement likely influenced Ford's decision to suspend (not fire), because unilateral termination could lead to grievances and arbitration.\"\n\nFor workers wondering if they can get fired for speaking their mind at work, Kluger made it clear the answer is yes.\n\n\"Try telling your boss what you really think of them and see how long you remain employed,\" he said.",

    "description": "Greenland's natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset to the US military since World War II.",
    "fullText": "Visitors to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland are greeted by a sign welcoming them to the \"top of the world.\"\n\nAs the US military's northernmost installation, Pituffik Space Base's operations include scientific research, space surveillance, and missile detection.\n\nGreenland's abundant natural resources and proximity to Russia and China have made it a valuable strategic asset since World War II — so much so that US President Donald Trump has often expressed his intent to purchase the autonomous Danish territory.\n\nVice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited the military base in March 2025 amid rising tensions between the US, Denmark, and Greenland.\n\nThose tensions have continued to flare as Trump has refused to rule out the use of military force to take control of Greenland. In a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Trump wrote that the US \"needs Greenland\" and \"anything less than that is unacceptable.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Denmark increased its military presence in Greenland, citing \"security tensions.\" Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday.\n\nHere's a look inside Greenland's only US military base.\n\nTrump first expressed interest in buying Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory, during his first presidency. In addition to being rich in natural resources, Greenland's Arctic location is well-placed to further US interests by countering China and Russia.\n\nSince his reelection, Trump has repeatedly conveyed his desire to acquire Greenland and said he would not rule out the use of military force to take it.\n\n\"We need Greenland for national security. One way or the other we're going to get it,\" he said in his joint address to Congress in March 2025.\n\nBoth Denmark and Greenland's leaders have maintained that the island is not for sale.\n\nSecond lady Usha Vance was originally scheduled to visit Greenland on a solo trip in 2025 to \"visit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersua, Greenland's national dogsled race,\" the White House said.\n\nInstead, the trip was scaled back. The vice president and second lady visited Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, the US military's northernmost installation, in March.\n\nUsha Vance's solo trip could have violated diplomatic protocol by sending a delegation to another country without an invitation. The amended plan — visiting a US base — avoided that potential violation. While Trump said that \"people from Greenland are asking us to go there,\" the government of Greenland said they had not invited any foreign delegations to visit.\n\n\"Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,\" the government's official Facebook page wrote in a post on Monday.\n\nGreenland's then-prime minister, Múte Bourup Egede, also called Usha Vance's planned trip \"very aggressive\" in an interview with Sermitsiaq, a Greenlandic newspaper.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, JD Vance's press secretary, told Business Insider at the time that the vice president and second lady were \"proud\" to visit the US military base in Greenland.\n\n\"As the vice president has said, previous US leaders have neglected Arctic security, while Greenland's Danish rulers have neglected their security obligations to the island. The security of Greenland is critical in ensuring the security of the rest of the world, and the Vice President looks forward to learning more about the island.\"\n\nWhile the US doesn't own Greenland, it has had a military presence there since World War II.\n\nPituffik Space Base, originally named Thule Air Base, was formally established in 1951 as part of a Cold War-era defense treaty between the US and Denmark. It is located in Pituffik, Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle and halfway between New York and Moscow.\n\nAs a Danish territory, Greenland does not have a military of its own.\n\nAs the Pentagon's northernmost military base, Pituffik Space Base acts as a key Arctic defense outpost. Because of its location on the \"top of the world,\" it is an optimal vantage point for monitoring missile launches by US adversaries like Russia and establishing space superiority.\n\nThe base is the site of a phased-array radar, which can detect sea-launched and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and a surface-to-air missile system, which intercepts hostile threats.\n\nThe base has a Satellite Command and Control system to maintain real-time communications and data relay with military and intelligence satellites. Its high-altitude location also allows it to more frequently track polar-orbit satellites, which can monitor the entire Earth's surface over time as the planet rotates below them.\n\nBecause Pituffik's primary mission is space surveillance and missile warning, the space base doesn't house a permanently stationed fighter wing or naval fleet.\n\nInstead, it acts as a strategic logistics and defense hub for Arctic missions and under-ice operations. From the site, which is the world's northernmost deep-water seaport, surface vessels and submarines operated by the US Navy and allied forces conduct Arctic patrols and cold-weather training exercises.\n\nAircraft regularly fly in and out of the former air base, such as military cargo and refueling planes and maritime patrol aircraft. Occasionally, fighter jets and long-range bombers will fly to the base for Arctic deterrence deployments and training flights.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a permanent combat force, the Air Force does have one tugboat at Pituffik to support port operations, icebreaking, and maneuvering ships.\n\nA small but significant asset, the Rising Star helps keep supply routes open by breaking up and pushing floating ice. The tugboat guides supply ships through the port, making it a critical component in bringing fuel, food, and equipment to personnel year-round.\n\nHowever, since the base is locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Rising Star gets limited use because it can only be operated when the port is completely ice-free.\n\nPituffik Space Base is surrounded by ice for nine months out of every year. The closest town, the Inuit village of Qaanaaq, is located 65 miles away.\n\nTemperatures can range from 60 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, when there are 24 hours of daylight, to -50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, when there is no sunlight for weeks.\n\nWinter storms are categorized into five levels from least to most severe: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta. At the Bravo level, the buddy system is implemented so that no one walks outside alone. Non-essential facilities close at the Charlie level, and personnel must shelter in place during Delta storms.\n\nAbout 150 personnel are stationed at Pituffik.\n\nThe Dundas Buffet Dining Hall on base serves three meals a day with payments accepted through a meal card.\n\nThe Base Exchange, also known as \"BX,\" sells groceries, toiletries, souvenirs, and other assorted goods. It also houses a barber shop.\n\nThere are no ATMs at Pituffik Space Base, but the Base Exchange accepts debit and credit cards as well as US dollars.\n\nPituffik Space Base features a bowling alley, a chapel, and a community center with a theater and craft room.\n\nThere's also a gymnasium and workout room stocked with weights and treadmills.\n\nPituffik Space Base's official Facebook page shows personnel participating in recreational events such as a Hawaiian-themed Arctic luau party, Greenlandic Heritage Week, and cross-country skiing.\n\nThe US built airbases and weather stations across the ice sheet during World War II as refueling stops on transatlantic flights and supply routes.\n\nTwo decommissioned airbases are now being used as civilian airports, and a third was abandoned after the war ended.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the US Air Force also built four stations on Greenland's coasts as part of a larger communication network of more than 60 radar installations to detect Soviet bombers. Most of the stations have since been deactivated, left to deteriorate atop Greenland's ice sheet.\n\nIn 2024, NASA scientists detected an underground base for a top-secret Cold War-era missile operation known as Camp Century. Now buried 100 feet under the ice, the abandoned network of subterranean tunnels once operated under the guise of an Arctic research facility before the US government declassified it in 1995.\n\nBut the abandoned military sites represent more than just relics of past global conflicts. Thousands of gallons of biological, chemical, and radioactive waste left behind on the bases pose a significant environmental threat, especially as the planet warms.\n\nThe US military failed to clean up decommissioned facilities like Camp Century, assuming the ice sheet would entomb the waste and infrastructure over the years.\n\nHowever, at the current melting rate of the Arctic, researchers estimate that the waste could resurface around 2100. The question remains as to who is responsible for cleaning up the waste from abandoned US military facilities scattered throughout Greenland.\n\nThe US has long pursued access to or control over Greenland due to its strategic and economic significance, dating back as early as the late 19th century.\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has continued to double down on his ambitions to secure the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, saying he won't rule out military force or economic coercion to do so.\n\nThough the Danish government has remained steadfast in refusing the sale, Trump's so-called \"real estate deal\" has spotlighted Greenland's growing desire for independence from Denmark and disinterest in being owned by anybody, including the US.\n\n\"The time has come to stand together,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a press conference on Tuesday, appearing with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \"It has not been easy to stand up to completely unacceptable pressure from our closest allies for a lifetime. But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\"",

    "description": "Edward...",
    "fullText": "The president wants to resume nuclear testing.  Is he a warmonger or just an idiot?\n\nIt would be a mistake of radioactive proportions to resume nuclear testing. None of the three major nuclear powers—the United States, Russia, and China—has conducted a nuclear test since 1996, when the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was approved. The CTBT bans all nuclear tests worldwide and has been signed by 187 nations. The only country that has conducted nuclear tests this century is North Korea, which is universally regarded as a rogue state—not exactly the kind of company we should be keeping.\n\nInstead of deterring foreign nations, renewed testing would be like setting off, well, a nuclear chain reaction, with the US triggering Russia and China to ramp up their own testing, which would then likely trigger other countries to do so as well.\n\nBut while Beijing and Moscow may have much to gain from testing their nuclear weapons, the United States does not. The US has already conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests, more than all other nations combined. (By comparison, China has conducted 45 tests). We spend $25 billion each year to sustain the country’s nuclear warheads, including funding the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which maintains the weapons without explosive nuclear testing and includes room-size supercomputers, the world’s most powerful X-ray machine, and a laser system the size of a sports stadium. No other nation possesses such an extensive array of tools for nonnuclear testing.\n\nTrump’s own advisers are confident that our nuclear weapons work—just as they are confident that other countries are not testing their nuclear weapons. Trump’s nominee to run the US Strategic Command, Navy Vice Adm. Richard Correll, told Congress in October, “Neither China nor Russia has conducted a nuclear explosive test.”\n\nIn the face of such facts, Trump changed his story. He said that Russia and China are conducting secret nuclear tests and people “just don’t know about it.” According to Trump, “You don’t necessarily know where they’re testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test.”\n\nWhat Trump seems to be referring to are very small nuclear tests that are hard to detect and are sometimes referred to as “hydronuclear” tests. If Russia and China are conducting them, it would be in violation of the CTBT. But there is no proof that this is happening. Moreover, even if it were, renewed US nuclear testing would still not be justified. Even small US tests would give Russia and China the green light to conduct many large nuclear tests that would be much more useful. A better approach for the United States would be to seek greater transparency of global test sites.\n\nIt appears that Trump’s utter confusion—not any need to resume nuclear testing—is the root cause of this entire kerfuffle. Russia recently tested two new missiles—the Poseidon and the Skyfall—that Putin has said can evade US missile defenses. Crucially, however, there were no nuclear warheads—the part that goes “boom”—on these missiles. Trump is apparently mixing up the testing of missiles and the testing of nuclear bombs.\n\nSuch errors are harmful enough, but Trump has added to the danger by upping the ante in other ways. He continues to insist that he will build his space-based Golden Dome missile-defense system, which would cost more than $3 trillion. Yet scientists say that such missile-defense systems, like Reagan’s “Star Wars” boondoggle (or the scenario depicted in Kathryn Bigelow’s recent film A House of Dynamite), will not work. Instead of Golden Dome, it should be called Golden Sieve—it will cost a lot of money, and it will not be effective. And, once again, instead of reducing tensions, Trump is increasing them: Nations will respond to US long-range-missile defenses by building more offensive missiles.\n\nIf Trump actually wants to reduce the risk of nuclear war, as he claims, he should not build the Golden Dome. Instead, he should reach for the Golden Phone. He should talk to Putin and accept his invitation to stick with the New START treaty—the last US-Russian agreement to reduce nuclear weapons—which is set to expire in February 2026. Putin has proposed a one-year extension; the United States has yet to respond.\n\nIs Trump a warmonger or just an idiot? Is he hell-bent on starting a new nuclear arms race, or is he simply confused about the difference between a nuclear bomb test and a missile test? As horrific as it sounds, Trump may be on the verge of undermining US and global security—just so he doesn’t have to admit that he was wrong.",

    "fullText": "The order follows a nine-month investigation and includes broad exemptions for datacenters and consumers\n\nDonald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25% tariff on certain AI chips, such as the Nvidia H200 AI processor ​and a similar semiconductor from AMD called the MI325X, under a new national security order released by the White House.\n\nThe proclamation follows a nine-month investigation under ‌section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and targets a number of high-end semiconductors meeting certain performance benchmarks and devices containing them for import duties. The action is part of a broader effort to create incentives for chipmakers to produce more semiconductors in the US and decrease reliance on chip manufacturers in places such as Taiwan.\n\n“The United States currently fully manufactures only approximately 10 percent of the chips it requires, making it heavily reliant on foreign supply chains,” the proclamation said, adding that the reliance was a “significant economic and national ‌security risk”.\n\nThe White House said in a fact sheet that the tariffs would be narrowly focused and would not apply ​to chips and derivative devices imported for US datacenters – a huge consumer of AI chips – startups, non-datacenter consumer applications, non-datacenter civil industrial applications and US public sector applications.\n\nHoward Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, has broad discretion to apply further exemptions, according to the proclamation.\n\nShares of Nvidia, AMD and Qualcomm traded slightly lower in after-hours trading.\n\nTrump ‍in December said he would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports over Beijing’s “unreasonable” pursuit of chip industry dominance, but delayed the action until June 2027.\n\nThat move followed a year-long “Section 301” unfair trade practices investigation into China’s exports of “legacy”, or older-technology chips to the US, launched by former president Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nQuestions had swirled about the universe of products containing chips that would be ⁠hit by the tariffs, the tariff rates, and whether any countries, products or companies would be exempt. Wednesday’s announcement, coupled with the news from December, suggests a ‍light touch from the administration on chip imports, for now.\n\nTrump last year announced he would allow Nvidia to sell H200 chips to China in exchange for a cut of the sales of ‌those chips. Legal ‌experts questioned whether such an arrangement would violate the US constitution’s ban on taxing exports.\n\nThe Trump administration this week required that China-bound chips make a detour from Taiwan, where they are made, through the United States for testing by a third-party lab. When the chips enter the United States, they are subject to the 25% tariff announced on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n“We comply with all US export control laws and policies,” AMD said in a statement.\n\nTrump has deployed an ⁠array of tariffs aimed at bolstering ⁠US manufacturing, announcing in September sweeping ​new import tariffs, including 100% duties on branded drugs and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, triggering fresh trade uncertainty after a period of relative calm.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration announced investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as part of an effort to impose tariffs on them, arguing that extensive reliance on their foreign production poses a national security threat.\n\nWhile US companies ‍like Nvidia, AMD and Intel design many of the most widely used chips, most are made overseas, many by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the Semiconductor Industry Association also could not immediately be reached.\n\nTrump, in the near future, may also impose broader tariffs on imports of semiconductors and their derivative products to incentivize domestic manufacturing, according ​to the fact sheet.\n\nAn annex to the order clarifies that any 25% tariff imposed on semiconductors ‍under the order would not be stacked on top of the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration under other section 232 orders. They would be exempt from duties on copper, aluminum and steel, auto ​and truck parts.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s second term has been eventful. You wouldn’t know it from his approval numbers.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll from January found that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s performance as president. That’s virtually unchanged from March 2025, shortly after he took office for the second time.\n\nThe new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research does show subtle signs of vulnerability for the Republican president. Trump hasn’t convinced Americans that the economy is in good shape, and many question whether he has the right priorities when he’s increasingly focused on foreign intervention. His approval rating on immigration, one of his signature issues, has also slipped since he took office.\n\nHere’s how Americans’ views of Trump have — and haven’t — changed over the past year, according to AP-NORC polling.\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans consistently approved of Trump's performance\n\nCall it a gift or a curse — for all his unpredictability, Trump's approval numbers just don't change very much.\n\nThis was largely the case during his first term in office, too. Early in his first term, 42% of Americans approved of how he was handling the presidency. There were some ups and downs over the ensuing years, but he left office with almost the same approval.\n\nThat level of consistency on presidential approval numbers could be the new normal for U.S. politics — or it could be unique to Trump. Gallup polling since the 1950s shows that presidential approval ratings have grown less variable over time. But President Joe Biden had a slightly different experience. Biden, a Democrat, entered the White House with higher approval numbers than Trump has ever received, but those fell rapidly during his first two years in office, then stayed low for the remainder of his term.\n\nMost Americans have held a critical view of Trump throughout his time in office, and Americans are twice as likely to say he's focused on the wrong priorities than the right ones. About half of U.S. adults say he’s mostly focusing on the wrong priorities one year into his second term, and approximately 2 in 10 say he’s mostly focused on the right priorities. Another 2 in 10, roughly, say it’s been about an even mix, and 14% say they don't have an opinion.\n\nThe economy has haunted Trump in his first year back in the White House, despite his insistence that “the Trump economic boom has officially begun.”\n\nJust 37% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling the economy. That’s up slightly from 31% in December — which marked a low point for Trump — but Trump started out with low approval on this issue, which doesn’t give him a lot of room for error.\n\nThe economy is a new problem for Trump. His approval rating on this issue in his first term fluctuated, but it was typically higher. Close to half of Americans approved of Trump’s economic approach for much of his first White House stint, and he’s struggled to adjust to this as a weak point. Americans care a lot more about costs than they did in Trump’s first term, and, like Biden, he’s persistently asserted that the U.S. economy is not a problem while the vast majority describe it as “poor.”\n\nAbout 6 in 10 U.S. adults say Trump has done more to hurt the cost of living in his second term, while only about 2 in 10 say he’s done more to help. About one-quarter say he hasn't made an impact.\n\nViews of Trump’s handling of immigration have declined\n\nWhen Trump entered office, immigration was among his strongest issues. It’s since faded, a troubling sign for Trump, who campaigned on both economic prosperity and crackdowns to illegal immigration.\n\nJust 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March. The poll was conducted Jan. 8-11, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.\n\nBut there are signs that Americans still give Trump some leeway on immigration issues. About half of U.S. adults say Trump has “gone too far” when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, which is unchanged since April, despite an immigration crackdown that spread to cities across the U.S. in the second half of the year.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, say Trump has helped immigration and border security “a lot” or “a little” in his second term. This is an area where Democrats are more willing to give Trump some credit. About 2 in 10 Democrats say Trump has helped on this issue, higher than the share of Democrats who say he's helped on costs or job creation.\n\nAs Trump turns to foreign policy, most Americans disapprove of his approach\n\nTrump has focused his attention more on foreign policy in his second term, and polling shows most Americans disapprove of his approach.\n\nBut much like Trump's overall approval, views of his handling of foreign policy have changed little in his second term, despite wide-ranging actions including his push to control Greenland and the recent military capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of foreign policy, and most Americans, 56%, say Trump has “gone too far” in using the U.S. military to intervene in other countries.\n\nTrump’s continued focus on global issues could be a liability given its sharp contrast with the “America First” platform he ran on and Americans’ growing concern with costs at home. But it could also be hard to shift views on the issue — even if Trump takes more dramatic action in the coming months.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll of 1,203 adults was conducted Jan. 8-11 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.",

Asked directly what was standing in the way, he gave a one-word answer to Reuters: “Zelensky.”\n\nAt the same time, Trump argued that Moscow is prepared to conclude the conflict, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is eager to bring the nearly four-year invasion to a close. “I think he’s ready to make a deal,” Trump said, adding, “I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal.”\n\nOn Thursday, the Kremlin said they agree with Trump’s remarks, which are in contrast to those of European allies, who have long maintained that Moscow is not genuinely interested in ending the conflict, instead aiming to seize additional territory while avoiding new Western sanctions.\n\nTrump, who previously said he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in a day” if he won a second term, has frequently clashed with Zelensky over the past year.\n\nNegotiations took a sharp turn in March last year when a public clash between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office derailed a widely promoted agreement that would have given the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, with the Ukrainian president leaving the White House without signing the deal. In the aftermath, Trump briefly halted military assistance and intelligence sharing, though both were restored the following month.\n\nSince then, the interactions between the two presidents have improved, with Ukrainian officials being deeply involved in recent peace talks, led by the U.S.\n\nRecent U.S.-led diplomacy has focused on what security guarantees Ukraine would receive after a ceasefire to prevent another Russian attack. As part of those discussions, American negotiators have broadly urged Kyiv to consider relinquishing control of the eastern Donbas region in exchange for an agreement with Russia.\n\nZelensky, however, has repeatedly rejected any suggestion of territorial concessions, insisting Ukraine’s constitution bars the government from surrendering any of its land to Moscow.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces have continued to press their offensive in Ukraine despite Trump’s claims that his pressure campaign and peace efforts are gaining traction with the Kremlin.\n\nIn mid-January, Moscow confirmed the launch of a hypersonic Oreshnik missile into western Ukraine near the EU border, a high-speed strike that hit infrastructure in the Lviv region. Western officials condemned it as an escalation even as peace proposals were being discussed.\n\nAt the same time, Russia has repeatedly carried out large waves of missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure while diplomatic talks have continued. In December, Ukrainian authorities reported hundreds of drones and missiles targeting power stations and other sites across the country, causing multiple injuries and widespread damage even as discussions on ending the war persisted.\n\nMoscow’s foreign ministry has also signaled reluctance to accept partial ceasefires as credible.\n\nIn his New Year’s message, Zelensky warned that Moscow was deliberately continuing its war, saying that “Russia deliberately brings war” with night time shelling and large drone attacks, and thanked Ukrainian defenders for repelling many of them.\n\nWhen asked why he believes Zelensky has resisted moving forward with peace talks, Trump told Reuters: “I just think he’s, you know, having a hard time getting there.”",

    "description": "Nobel economist Paul Krugman says that reviving an Obama-era consumer watchdog would be a low-effort was to protect Americans.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump has unveiled a slew of proposals aimed at making life more affordable for everyday Americans, but according to one top economist, there's something that would make a bigger difference than anything the president has floated so far.\n\nTrump has laid out plans to tackle everything from mortgage rates to credit card debt to energy costs. Yet, Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman thinks those options pale in comparison to one move Trump could make with relative ease: reviving an Obama-era consumer watchdog.\n\nIn an analysis of Trump's plans posted on his Substack, Krugman laid out the problems he sees with credit card lending practices in the US, noting that Trump's move to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should be rolled back.\n\n\"This would immediately help Americans with credit card debt, and many other struggling American families as well,\" he said. \"No legislation would be required, since the CFPB was established by law. If Trump really wants to cap credit card interest rates, he should reach across the aisle and get legislation passed with Democratic support.\"\n\nKrugman said there's a strong case for government involvement in the industry, and that such a move would directly benefit US consumers.\n\n\"In straight economic terms there is a valid case for government intervention to protect consumers by reducing credit card interest rates,\" he wrote. \"There is also a valid case for action to end other abusive credit card practices, such as exorbitant late fees.\"\n\nThe economist said that while he agrees with the president's plan to deliver relief from high credit card rates, he doesn't think it will garner the support needed from Congress. Bringing back the CFBP, however, would require minimal effort, Krugman said.\n\nKrugman's perspective on the benefits of an interest rate cap runs counter to the views of other finance pros. Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi recently told Business Insider that the plan would likely result in lower credit availability for many borrowers, particularly middle- and lower-income households.\n\nAnalysts from UBS had a similar view this week, arguing that Trump's plan could also hit GDP growth by sparking a decline in consumer spending.",

    "description": "Brooke Rollins suggested eating ‘a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing’ as Americans struggle to put food on the table",
    "fullText": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has been mocked online over a “depression meal” she suggested for Americans after the Trump administration turned the food pyramid upside down.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture recently released new dietary guidelines, suggesting Americans eat more protein, dairy and healthy fats and less whole grains. Rollins and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously said he was on a so-called carnivore diet, told Americans when rolling out the guidelines to “eat real food.”\n\nIn a TV appearance on Wednesday, Rollins suggested an affordable, albeit lackluster, meal Americans can make that sticks to the new guidelines.\n\n“We've run over 1,000 simulations. It can cost around $3 a meal for a piece of chicken, a piece of broccoli, corn tortilla and one other thing. And so, there is a way to do this that actually will save the average American consumer money,” Rollins told News Nation.\n\nA clip of Rollins' comments was shared online, and social media users were quick to poke fun at the out-of-touch dining suggestion.\n\n“Private jets and tax breaks for them and their rich friends, and one piece of broccoli *AND* a tortilla for you!” Chasten Glezman Buttigieg, the husband of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, wrote on X.\n\nMarlow Stern, who teaches at the Columbia Journalism School, posted, “‘You should eat prison meals’ prob not the best message.”\n\n“One whole tortilla?!” Democratic strategist Jennifer Holdsworth sarcastically said.\n\nFred Wellman, podcast host and Democratic Congressional candidate, wrote, “They hate so much of America. They just hate them.”\n\n“Are they doing Monte Carlo simulations to create the most affordable r/depressionmeal,” Tyson Brody, who identifies as an opposition researcher, posted.\n\nWhile inflation held steady in December at 2.7 percent, grocery prices remained high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Uncooked ground beef was up 15.5 percent, and frozen fish and seafood increased 8.6 percent year-on-year.\n\nHealth experts Lauren Ball and Emily Burch weighed in on the new dietary guidelines’ lack of attention to socio-economic issues when it comes to food.\n\n“Access to affordable, healthy food remains limited across the US, especially for people in low-income communities, rural areas, or those working long and unpredictable hours,” the two wrote for The Independent. “People choose food based on whether it’s affordable, accessible and culturally relevant – but the guidelines overlooked these structural drivers.”",

    "fullText": "The United States is considering whether to strike Iran as turmoil intensifies for the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nThe Iranian government is at its weakest point in years, destabilizing yet another OPEC nation less than two weeks after the United States toppled the government of Venezuela.\n\nProtests have erupted in the streets across Iran, and the government’s deadly crackdown on protesters crossed a red line President Donald Trump had drawn. Trump has signaled that his administration is weighing an attack – although on Wednesday, Trump said the United States will continue to “watch and see what the process is” to determine whether to take action against Iran.\n\nIran controls the third-largest proven oil reserves on Earth and one of the world’s most important oil shipping lanes. Those factors will shape the country’s future, regardless of whether the US intervenes.\n\nIran produces about 3.2 million barrels of oil per day, on average, according to OPEC, accounting for roughly 4% of global crude production. That makes Iran the world’s sixth-largest oil producer – an impressive feat, considering Iran faces burdensome worldwide sanctions that have severely limited its potential customers .To skirt sanctions, Iran operates a shadow fleet of vessels to export oil at a steep discount.\n\nBut Iran’s potential far outweighs its actual output. The country is sitting on 209 million barrels of oil in reserve, behind only Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And its daily production is less than half the 6.5 million barrels per day Iran produced in the mid-1970s before revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.\n\nLike Venezuela, China is by far Iran’s biggest customer: It buys 89% of Iran’s oil, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The similarities don’t end there: Iran also nationalized the country’s energy infrastructure after expropriating foreign oil companies’ assets in past decades.\n\nBut Iran is a much more important for global energy than Venezuela.\n\n“Iran is significantly larger than Venezuela for oil markets,” said Luisa Palacios, a former Citgo chairwoman and current managing director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “Developments for Iran matter much more for oil markets in the near term, because of the risk of oil supply disruption.”\n\nThe price of oil has already risen sharply because of the threat of disruption to Iran’s oil. Crude rose above $61 a barrel Wednesday in response to threats of an attack on Iran – just a week after oil fell to $56 a barrel when Trump promised US oil companies would ramp up production in Venezuela.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — More than a year before an American military operation deposed Nicolás Maduro, a senior aide to President Donald Trump argued that the Venezuelan leader had been dispatching gang members into the United States.\n\n\"If you’re a dictator of a poor country with a high crime rate, wouldn’t you send your criminals to our open border?” Stephen Miller told reporters in the closing stretch of Trump's 2024 comeback campaign.\n\nMiller now serves as the White House chief of staff for policy, where he plays a prominent role in promoting Trump's policy agenda. His bombastic style and zero-sum worldview have made him a lightning rod within the administration. Critics argue that Miller’s rhetoric about foreign nations and immigrants echoes racist and imperialist ideas that have undergirded military actions by the U.S. and other nations for centuries.\n\nA joint statement from the governments of Spain and five Latin American countries following the Venezuela operation called for countries in the region to engage in “mutual respect, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and nonintervention,” while Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the administration's Venezuela policy “old-fashioned imperialism.”\n\n“Advocating for policies that put American citizens first isn’t racist. Anyone who says so is either intentionally lying or just plain stupid,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson.\n\nHere's a look at how Miller laid the rhetorical groundwork for this month's attack on Venezuela and what his comments say about the administration's broader worldview.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations’ aid to developing world was ‘reverse colonization’\n\nShortly after the U.S. operation that captured Maduro, Miller wrote on social media: “Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have already made them far wealthier and more successful). The West opened its borders, a kind of reverse colonization, providing welfare and thus remittances, while extending to these newcomers and their families not only the full franchise but preferential legal and financial treatment over the native citizenry. The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world.\"\n\nMiller argues that Venezuelan oil was stolen from US oil industry\n\nTwo weeks before Maduro's arrest, Miller in December echoed arguments by Trump that the Venezuelan oil industry was stolen from American oil companies:\n\n“American sweat, ingenuity and toil created the oil industry in Venezuela. Its tyrannical expropriation was the largest recorded theft of American wealth and property. These pillaged assets were then used to fund terrorism and flood our streets with killers, mercenaries and drugs,” Miller wrote on social media.\n\nMiller says Venezuelan government is in service to US\n\nMiller in January claimed to reporters that U.S. military power had ensured compliance from the Caracas government.\n\n“We have an oil embargo in Venezuela for them to do any kind of commerce. They need our permission. We have our massive fleet or armada still present there. This is an active and ongoing U.S. government military operation, and so, of course, we set the terms and conditions,\" Miller said.\n\nHe added: “Our conversations are that we are very much getting full, complete and total cooperation from the government of Venezuela, and as a result of that cooperation, the people of Venezuela are going to become richer than they ever have before. And of course, the United States is going to benefit from this massively in terms of economic, security and military cooperation, counter-narcotics, counterterrorism and every other dimension of our security.\"\n\nMiller calls for a world order based on strength, says US military occupation of Greenland would not be opposed\n\nDuring a wide-ranging January interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Miller repeatedly argued for the primacy of American power and criticized the international order the U.S. once led.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller also dismissed concerns that Trump's vows to take Greenland from Denmark, a fellow member of the NATO military alliance, may trigger a military conflict with Europe.\n\n“Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,\" said Miller.\n\nMiller argues that Western nations engaged in ‘groveling’ to former colonies\n\nIn the same interview, Miller said it would be “absurd and preposterous” and “not even a serious question” to propose the administration support Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's bid to lead the country because the military would not back her.\n\nTapper then asked whether the South American country should hold elections.\n\nMiller replied: “The United States is using its military to secure our interests unapologetically in our hemisphere. We’re a superpower, and under President Trump, we are going to conduct ourselves as a superpower. It is absurd that we would allow a nation in our own backyard to become the supplier of resources to our adversaries, but not to us, to hoard weapons from our adversaries, to be able to be positioned as an asset against the United States, rather than on behalf of the United States.”\n\nThe anchor pressed Miller on whether sovereign countries had the right to conduct their own affairs.\n\nMiller explained the administration’s stance: “The Monroe Doctrine and the Trump Doctrine is all about securing the national interest of America. For years, we sent our soldiers to die in deserts in the Middle East to try to build them parliaments, to try to build them democracies, to try to give them more oil, try to give them more resources. The future of the free world, Jake, depends on America being able to assert ourselves and our interests without apology.\" He called for an end to \"This whole period that happened after World War II, where the West began apologizing and groveling and engaging in these massive reparations schemes.”\n\nHe also defended the administration's operation and echoed his past claims that Maduro had sent criminals into the U.S.: “We’re not going to let tinpot communist dictators send rapists into our country, send drugs into our country, send weapons into our country.\"\n\nMiller criticizes anti-ICE protests following immigration crackdown in Minneapolis\n\nMiller has returned to promoting the administration's stance on domestic issues like immigration and partisan politics.\n\nOn Tuesday, following nationwide protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minnesota, Miller wrote on social media: “Americans voting overwhelmingly for mass deportation. Congress passed laws requiring it and then passed new legislation to fully fund it. The response of the Democrat Party and its activists has been to support and orchestrate violent resistance against federal law enforcement.”\n\nHe later added in a separate post, “In case it isn’t clear by now, if Democrats won they would have made every city into Mogadishu or Kabul or Port-au-Prince.\"",

    "title": "Why this legal expert says the Minnesota and Illinois immigration lawsuits ‘are close to completely meritless’",
    "description": "Illinois and Minnesota sued the Trump administration over its immigration crackdown. But they have a tough road ahead of them in court, one legal analyst says.",
    "fullText": "Over the last several months, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen a dramatic escalation in federal immigration enforcement along their chilly streets, with agents arresting thousands – including some US citizens – in neighborhoods, shopping centers, schools and at protests.\n\nThe surge is the result of the Trump administration’s commitment to cracking down on immigration, concentrated in Democratic-led cities, and follows weeks of growing tensions between the federal government and local Midwestern officials who have long implored for an end to the operations.\n\nIllinois and Minnesota, joined by their city counterparts, are now separately pursuing legal action against the administration, filing lawsuits Monday in federal courts over immigration enforcement they call unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nA judge decided not to issue a temporary restraining order in the Minnesota lawsuit during a status conference Wednesday morning, but said her decision “should not be considered a prejudgment.”\n\nThe lawsuit presents “somewhat frontier issues in constitutional law,” US District Judge Katherine Menendez said. A hearing has not yet been scheduled in Illinois.\n\nThe road ahead for both suits appears dim, with their likelihood for success small, one expert says.\n\nElie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN senior legal analyst, has closely followed the turmoil in Chicago and the Twin Cities. Here, he breaks down the lawsuits, their merits and what’s next in the courtrooms.\n\nSome of the answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCNN: What are Illinois and Minnesota asking for from judges in their lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Fundamentally, both of these states are asking federal judges to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement from enforcing immigration law in their states and cities. There are variations between them, but that’s the core ask. As a backup, both states ask the courts for some sort of ruling or declaration that some of the tactics ICE is using are unconstitutional.\n\nCNN: What are the key differences between the lawsuits?\n\nHonig: The main difference is that Illinois asks to block all ICE activity in the state, whereas Minnesota phrases its ask as seeking to stop this “surge” of officers. But pointing to the surge is legally irrelevant, because whether you’re talking about a group of ICE agents who are already there, or who were added after some point, the fundamental ask is still the same. You’re still asking a judge to block ICE from doing its job as it sees fit in your state.\n\nCNN: What is the legal precedent for an ask like that?\n\nHonig: None. There is no example, nor does either state cite an example in their papers, of a judge prohibiting a federal law enforcement agent from enforcing federal law in a given state. The reaction that we’ve heard from various Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, when confronted with this lack of precedent and lack of case law, is essentially, “Well, this is really bad, though. Well, this is an invasion.” There is plenty of dramatic language in the complaints, but that doesn’t change the legal calculus. You can’t just take a situation that has no legal precedent and no legal support and say, “Well, yes, but our situation is really, really bad, therefore we get to invent new law.”\n\nCNN: In your opinion, how strong do you think the states’ arguments are?\n\nHonig: I think the arguments that both states are making, that ICE should be blocked, either entirely or just the surge, are close to completely meritless. Fundamentally, what they’re asking for is legally completely unwarranted.\n\nCNN: What do you think is the most likely outcome for each suit?\n\nHonig: It’s so dependent on the judge here. But I think the best, realistic scenario for the states is – if they get sympathetic judges who decide to put ICE through its paces – maybe they call in ICE agents as witnesses, or ICE officials as witnesses, probe into ICE’s training, policies and tactics and issue some sort of declaration that ICE needs to do things differently or better. Some sort of window dressing like that is probably the best realistic outcome. There’s no way a judge is going to say, “I hereby block you, ICE, from carrying out enforcement activities.” And if a judge does do that, it’ll be reversed.\n\nCNN: What are the legal principles at play here on the other side?\n\nHonig: First, it’s the Supremacy Clause, which says that the state and local authorities cannot block the feds from carrying out their federal duties. And also Article Two, which gives the federal executive branch the power to enforce federal law. Those are the legal theories that really are in play here.\n\nCNN: If the states’ chances of winning are close to zero, what can be done?\n\nHonig: I’m not saying there’s nothing to be done. This is just not the way to address any abuses or excesses by ICE. If a person has his or her rights violated, if a search is unlawful, if a person is wrongly detained, if a person is injured or killed wrongly by ICE, they can sue. They can go to court and seek specific redress for their specific injuries. What the courts are not supposed to do, first of all, is prohibit the federal executive branch from carrying out federal executive branch prerogatives and, secondly, issue blanket theoretical advisory rulings about the way the world ought to look or ought not to look. Cases need to be about specific injury and specific redress, and these lawsuits are not that.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October 2025 after it federalized and tried to deploy the Illinois National Guard, also arguing in part that it violated the 10th Amendment. The state was successful in that case and Trump has largely backed off National Guard deployment there for now. What are the key differences between that case and this one over immigration enforcement?\n\nHonig: The National Guard was an entirely different case where Trump used a specific law, Section 12406, to deploy the National Guard. The Supreme Court offered a very specific and nuanced definition of the term “regular forces,” and whether that meant regular law enforcement forces, or regular military forces. So that case was based on the action Trump took that was based on a specific federal statute, and the Supreme Court construed and defined that statute against the Trump administration. Legally, it’s a completely different scenario from what we have here.\n\nCNN: Illinois and Minnesota filed their suits Monday; the latter also filing a temporary restraining order request. What happens now?\n\nHonig: One of two things. One, the judges can just reject these out of hand. I think that’s unlikely. I think the judges are going to want to hear further from the parties. The judges might decide to hold fact-finding hearings, they might decide, “I want to dig into what ICE is doing a bit.” That’s all within the broad discretion of these district court judges. I think those are the next steps, but if a district court judge is to say, “ICE, you can’t go in there, you can’t go into that state, you can’t go into that city,” I think that will get reversed real quick.\n\nCNN: Is there a timeline we can anticipate here for how quickly the judges may act on these lawsuits?\n\nHonig: Judges are in charge of handling their own dockets and calendars. I would assume judges would understand that these are fairly immediate and emergent issues and would want to get the parties in court within days, not months.",

    "title": "Trump Imposes Limited Tariffs on Foreign Semiconductors",
    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "description": "Betting odds for who might succeed Powell have shifted. Bettors also think there's a growing chance Powell stays on as governor past the end of his term.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump could be fighting with the Fed all year.\n\nIn the days since it was revealed that the US Department of Justice is investigating Jerome Powell, a growing view among investors and analysts is that the Fed chair could end up sticking around after his term ends in May.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation relates to Powell's congressional testimony about the Fed's building renovations, and Trump has said he had no knowledge of the probe.\n\nStill, markets have interpreted the move as another attempt to influence the Fed to cut interest rates. They're also increasingly betting that the president's fight with the Fed will probably last beyond the end of Powell's term.\n\nSome say the latest developments have made it more likely that Powell will choose to stay on the Fed's board of governors even after his term as Fed Chair.\n\nOn Polymarket, the odds that Powell will leave the Fed board by the end of May and the end of December both plunged shortly after Powell released his video responding to the probe on January 11.\n\nBettors think there's a 45% chance Powell will leave the Fed by May 30, down from 74% earlier this month. They see a 62% chance he will leave the Fed by the end of the year, down from 85% earlier in the month.\n\nBetting markets have also repriced the odds that Trump ally Kevin Hassett is nominated to replace Powell. Kevin Warsh, a more hawkish name on the list for Fed chair, began to pull ahead of Hassett on Polymarket around the time news of the DOJ probe began to circulate.\n\nAs far as lowering interest rates is concerned, Trump's fight with the Fed could end up having the opposite outcome the president is hoping for, according to Chris Whalen, analyst and chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.\n\n\"You're going to have a more hawkish FOMC as we have now, and then you're going to have Chairman Powell sitting there as a governor for the next two years till the end of Trump's term. That's not what they wanted,\" Whalen told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nThere's a reason markets see the latest pressure on Powell backfiring. The logic goes something like this:\n\n\"I think that Trump is in perilous waters right now when it comes to his Fed appointment,\" Whalen added. \"I think Kevin Hassett may be done.\"\n\nThe investigation into Powell could also delay the confirmation of the next Fed Chair.\n\n\"I always thought there was an informal agreement since last summer between Trump and Powell, that if Powell agrees to leave the Fed when his chairmanship ends in May, then Trump will not bring up the construction project anymore,\" Clifton told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to how Trump criticized the Fed's multibillion renovation before the president cooled criticism of the central bank through the second half of the year.\n\n\"That line was crossed on Sunday one way or another,\" Clifton said. \"It makes it more likely that Powell can stay on a seat as a regular member.\"\n\nIt also means Powell could become a \"shadow Fed Chair\" himself, Clifton suggested, referring to an idea the Trump administration floated about an incoming central bank chief who can influence monetary policy expectations before the end of Powell's term.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump has mishandled the Fed. The way to have dealt with this was to simply say, 'You know, he hasn't done a good job. We're looking forward to getting a new chairman.' That's it,\" Whalen said, adding that he now expected Powell to stay on the Fed's board until his term as governor ends in 2028. \"By attacking Powell personally, continuously, I think they're not going to get what they want.\"",

At least one company has already moved to do so.\n\nBilt Rewards announced a new suite of credit cards on Wednesday called \"Bilt 2.0,\" which will offers new cardholders 10% interest rates for their first year.\n\n\"We want to be on the side of this conversation, for right now, on the side of consumers and affordability,\" Bilt Rewards CEO Ankur Jain told Fox Business on Wednesday. \"On new purchases of the Bilt card, we're going to make sure that our consumers have access to that lower 10%.\"\n\nBilt is known for allowing users to earn rewards on rent and mortgage payments without the related fees associated with other credit cards.\n\nThe company unveiled three cards, including:\n\nAfter one year, interest rates for new cardholders will increase to between 26.74% to 37.47%, depending on the card.\n\nTrump called for the 10% cap in a Truth Social post on Friday, saying that he will \"no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more.\"\n\nFor now, any action taken by credit card companies is voluntary. Trump can't make the change by himself — he'll need an act of Congress in order to do so.\n\nIndependent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a period of five years. Trump also called Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday to discuss the issue.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Mike Johnson has thrown cold water on the idea, saying that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy, including the possibility that credit card companies would \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nBusiness leaders have offered mixed reviews of Trump's proposal, with some making the same argument as Johnson.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Citi's chief financial officer, Mark Mason, said on a call with reporters. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"",

The brief visit was intended to highlight the White House's commitment to rebuilding the US workforce and Ford's focus on rebuilding a blue-collar workforce pipeline.\n\nVideo from the event obtained by TMZ shows Trump gesturing after someone shouted \"pedophile protector\" — which Sabula has since said was him — in an apparent reference to White House's delay in releasing the full Epstein files. The President can be seen raising his middle finger after the remark and mouthing an expletive.\n\nThe White House told several news outlets that Trump was appropriately responding to \"a lunatic\" who \"was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.\"\n\nA source at the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union that represents the Ford plant, confirmed to Business Insider that Sabula was suspended.\n\n\"The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union—the UAW,\" Laura Dickerson, the vice president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), told Business Insider in an email.\n\n\"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nDickerson said the UAW is reviewing Sabula's suspension.\n\n\"Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States,\" she added.\n\nSabula told the Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I don't feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,\" he added.\n\n\"TJ and his family greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time, we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support,\" read an update on both campaigns. \"We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\"\n\n\"TJ Sabula is a patriot,\" said one of the GoFundMe campaigns, which more than 21,000 people donated to.\n\n\"Let's rally and support TJ and help him pay some bills (and force DJT to release the Trump/Epstein Files),\" continues the post, which was published last night.\n\nIn November, Trump signed a bipartisan bill called the Epstein Files Transparency Act that required the release of all FBI materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein by December 19, 2025. While some files have been released, the Department of Justice said it's still scrambling to review around 5.2 million remaining documents weeks after the mandated release date.\n\n\"TJ Sabula, a worker at the Ford Rouge Plant, voiced concerns about President Donald J Trump during the president's visit to the plant. Ford responded by suspending TJ without pay,\" reads a second GoFundMe organized by Diandra Gourlay, which has raised money from over 13,000 people.\n\nGourlay described herself as \"a longtime personal friend of the Sabula family.\"\n\nBoth GoFundMe campaigns list \"Thomas Sabula\" as the official beneficiary of the donations.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump posted a baffling social media post demanding that a U.S. citizen and Democratic congresswoman be “thrown out” of the country.\n\nThe president has been raging against Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for more than a month after news broke that some members of the Somali diaspora had allegedly defrauded the state of Minnesota by billing for social services that were never provided.\n\n“They should be thrown out of the USA. Get it done, NOW! That includes their loser Rep. Omar, who married her brother (gross!),” Trump wrote Wednesday on his platform Truth Social.\n\nHe then shared an interview with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, saying the state’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz “should be in cuffs.”\n\nNeither Walz nor Omar, who fled Somalia’s civil war as a child, has been accused of any involvement in the fraud scheme.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who the president was addressing or how he envisioned “throwing out” Omar, since it’s unconstitutional to deport an American citizen. The 43-year-old spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before being granted asylum and moving to the U.S., becoming a citizen in 2000 at age 17.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Omar, Walz, and the White House for comment.\n\nThe president apparently became fixated on the idea of “throwing out” Omar after he saw a video, which he shared on Christmas Day, of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly calling Omar’s citizenship into question.\n\n“Throw her out of the U.S., Now!” he wrote.\n\nHe also railed against her last month at a Cabinet meeting at the White House and a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people that work. These are people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain,” he told his Cabinet.\n\nLess than a week later, he took the stage at a rally in Pennsylvania and announced a “permanent pause” on migration from “hellholes” like Somalia, and once again raged against Omar until the crowd began chanting, “Send her back!”\n\nThe lawmaker responded by calling out Trump’s obsession with her, which she described as “creepy” and “weird.”\n\n“Trump’s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help,” she wrote on social media. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he’s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment.”",

    "description": "Citi's CFO Mark Mason said Trump's proposed credit card cap would have a 'deleterious' impact on the economy.",
    "fullText": "Citi's top executives warned that President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates could have dire consequences.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on a call with reporters ahead of the bank's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"\n\nMason said multiple times that he did not want to speculate on the impact of the potential cap, given the limited available information. He said that Citi would work with the Trump administration to address the \"important issue\" of affordability.\n\nReporters asked Mason about the cap multiple times, and he repeatedly said it would likely not help customers most in need, as is Trump's stated intention. He said later in the call that, again, it would have a \"very negative impact on the economy.\"\n\nOn the bank's earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser said that \"a rate cap is not something that we can support\" when asked about the news that Bilt Rewards is releasing three cards with interest rates capped at 10%, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\"To be clear, the impact to us and other banks would just be dwarfed by the severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country. These things just don't work out as intended,\" Fraser continued.\n\nMuch like Mason did on an earlier call, Fraser acknowledged the importance of affordability and said she's keen to collaborate with the administration.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates. He argued that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. A cap would have to be approved by Congress, and similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nOther bank leaders, including JPMorgan's CFO, Jeremy Barnum, have warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; however, others in the financial sector have applauded the plan.\n\nCiti's profits fell 13% in the fourth quarter, to $2.47 billion, brought down partly by the sale of its operations in Russia, the bank said in an earnings report.\n\nThe bank saw an 84% surge in financial advisory fees in the fourth quarter. The investment banking unit has been reenergized under its new head, JPMorgan veteran Viswas Raghavan. Investment banking revenues increased by 38%, the bank said, and investment banking fees rose 35%.\n\nCiti said that its \"Transformation\" — a years-long effort to modernize the bank and cut costs— is more than 80% complete, as stated in its earnings presentation. Fraser's attempted turnaround has included layoffs, new hires, and multibillion-dollar investments.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has helped boost a parabolic rally that's pushing gold and silver prices higher.\n\nA slew of geopolitical events and initiatives related to interest rates the president has kicked off in recent weeks has driven investors to gold, silver, and industrial metals like copper and tin.\n\nThe latest spike marks a new leg of the so-called debasement trade, which sees investors scooping up assets like gold and silver on fears that the US dollar and other currencies could be devalued.\n\nMarkets got a glimpse of the trend last year, when Trump's tariffs fueled a bout of panic selling in US stock and Treasurys, and a flight to store-of-value assets like gold.\n\nAfter finishing 2025 with its best performance in decades, gold is up another 5% so far this year.\n\nSilver, which also notched its best run since 1979 last year, is up 25% year-to-date, its best-ever start to the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Dollar Index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined 1% from its latest peak in November.\n\nA brief overview of events this month shows why investors are making the move.\n\nThe \"sell America\" impulse is also evident in how US bonds have sold off while the value of the dollar has declined, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"There are glimpses of the 'sell America' trade that we saw in the first half of last year,\" he wrote in a note on Monday, referring to similar moves in precious metals, bonds, and stocks when Trump first introduced his reciprocal tariffs last April.\n\nThis time, investors appear to be rattled by geopolitical tensions and fears that, if the president puts pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates prematurely, it could stoke inflation down the line,\n\n\"In addition to investors becoming more concerned about potential currency debasement and future inflation, these were supported by the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said of recent moves in gold and silver on Tuesday.\n\nIn a note to clients this week, BCA Research highlighted the recent rally in commodities and said it appeared some aspects of the \"'dollar debasement' trades\" were \"on fire\" this week.\n\n\"Gold and silver prices could extend gains as investors double down on 'Sell America' trades, and alternatives to the dollar might grind higher,\" Karl Schamotta, a chief market strategist at Corpay Cross-Border Solutions, wrote in a note.\n\nThe precious metals rally is getting a boost from other forces at play. Gold has been boosted by strong central bank demand in recent years. That, too, is a part of a broader sell America theme that's seen central banks load up on gold to diversify reserves away from the US dollar.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has been increasingly lumped into the AI trade as investors recognize the metal's use in data centers. Its price is also getting a boost from supply pressures and speculative trading in China.\n\n\"The 'Sell America' theme may be the dominant narrative,\" JPMorgan's market intelligence team said of the broader move in markets on Monday.",

Ives suggested that impeding the industry's progress now could compromise the broader US AI agenda.\n\n\"We believe this will be a continuous back and forth battle between Big Tech players and the Trump administration with data center buildouts an important aspect of fueling the AI Revolution over the coming years,\" Ives added.",

In one clip at his overseas course, Trump is shown in his cart following two men up the fairway when one drops a ball for him to play.\n\nTrump. Rigging the game.

    "fullText": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says he expects Republican President Donald Trump to try to interfere with the midterm elections, and he says raids by immigration agents in major cities are creating a sense of chaos that voters will reject in November.\n\nThe comments were part of a wide-ranging, 20-minute Associated Press telephone interview with the New York Democrat, who argued former Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola's entry into the Senate race gives his party a path to the majority.\n\nSchumer said that economic concerns have begun to cement in the minds of voters and that Democrats have plans to build their campaign around the costs, chaos and corruption they attribute to the Trump administration.\n\nThe White House has called such Democratic statements “fearmongering” to score political points.\n\nThis is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nQ: Some are predicting Trump will try to prevent an open and fair midterm election and would be expected to dispute the results. Do you share those concerns?\n\nA: We share them, and we already have teams of both senators and lawyers looking at every way that Trump could try to screw things up, and we’re fighting against it. We already have a team to make sure that they count the votes fairly. And, remember, still, a lot of the election mechanisms are done by the states. And even in red states, there’s resistance to Trump interfering.\n\nTrump will do whatever it takes, and he has no honor and no credibility and no respect for law. But, we are prepared for it, and we believe we will succeed.\n\nInfluence of ICE raids on election\n\nQ: What impact do you think the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are having on the midterms early on?\n\nA: People don’t like chaos. They see that cities and mayors who were perfectly calm and safe are now undergoing all of this chaos. And, you know, as I said, cost is number one. But it’s costs, corruption and chaos. The people don’t like it. And Trump, at the same time he's saying he wants to protect the protesters in Iran, he is going after protesters and other innocent civilians in Minneapolis. Makes no sense to people.\n\nQ: Does it seem to you like economic factors that are dissatisfying to a lot of the voting public are durable in this election year?\n\nA: Absolutely. The number one thing that bothers American families is they can't pay all the bills.\n\nThe costs is the number one issue. The cost of living, affordability, call it what you will. But it’s the number one issue, and now they realize that Trump is screwing them up on all of this.\n\nOn health care, with not extending the ACA tax credits, on energy, by getting rid of clean energy, wind and solar, raising their electric bills with tariffs, which is making the price of everything go up. So, people now realize that Trump is hurting them.\n\nWe are going to focus on five issues in terms of lowering people’s costs. They are health care, housing, tariffs — you know, costs of goods — food prices, because of food monopolies, and child care.\n\nTrump and the Republicans are in a bubble, and they don't understand it. They are ignoring it, and that's why things keep getting better and better for us.\n\nMidterm congressional environment\n\nQ: If we are looking at, in the House, 25 to 30 seats changing hands, is there a direct correlation to what can happen in the Senate?\n\nA: Look, at the beginning of (last) year, people said, “Well, there's a chance to win the House and no chance to win the Senate.” But because of the issues that I've talked about and because the House and Senate have been largely in sync on those issues and it's resonating with the American people how we're on their side, I think that the difference between the likelihood of winning the House and the likelihood of winning the Senate has greatly decreased.\n\nQ: Yet at this very moment, at the beginning of the midterm year, would you agree that Democrats have a narrow path back to the Senate majority?\n\nA: I say it is a much wider path than the skeptics think, and a much wider path than it was three months ago and certainly a year ago. And it keeps getting better and better, and we think we have a really good chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nYounger, non-white Trump voters\n\nQ: Younger and non-white voters drifted toward Trump in the last election, as you know. What is your plan, and what will it take for Democrats to win them over?\n\nA: The cost issue is really having an effect already. Look at the elections of 2025. Look at how (Democrat Abigail) Spanberger won by 15 points in Virginia and (Democrat Mikie) Sherrill won by 13 points (in 2025 governor's races). But it wasn't just those two states. We won elections in Georgia. We won elections across the country. And that is because voters, young and old, poor and middle class, don't think Trump was serving them well. So, there's been a whole turnaround about Trump.\n\nAnd in large part, we helped make it happen by focusing on costs.\n\nBeaumont reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

    "description": "Critics slammed the top Trump official's remarks as a \"greenlight for abuse.\"",
    "fullText": "White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller drew sharp condemnation Tuesday over a message he sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers during an interview with Fox News host Will Cain.\n\nMiller asserted that ICE agents have “federal immunity in the conduct of your duties” and declared that anyone who touches or obstructs them is “committing a felony.”\n\nLegal experts and commentators pushed back on social media, stressing that prosecuting federal agents is possible, even if it’s often difficult, as a recent HuffPost report explained.\n\nOther critics called Miller’s overall tone “utterly chilling” and a “greenlight for abuse” that amounted to declaring “open season” for ICE agents “on immigrants AND citizens alike” and encouraged officers to “go and spread violence and terror.”\n\nNews: Border Czar Frantically Backpedals After Breaking With Kristi Noem Over ICE Shooting\n\nMiller’s remarks came amid heightened scrutiny of ICE following the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nThe anti-immigration hardliner’s full comments were as follows:\n\n“To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. and anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one — no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist — can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties. And the Department of Justice has made clear that if officials cross that line into obstruction, into criminal conspiracy against the United States, or against ICE officers, then they will face justice.”\n\nREMINDER. “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.

    "description": "While major banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citi, warned that a 10% credit card cap would reduce access to credit, some CEOs applaud the plan.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders have mixed reviews of President Donald Trump's new plan for credit cards.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said on Friday he would call for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card interest rates, arguing that consumers are being \"ripped off\" by rates that he said can be as high as 20% or 30%. Congress, not the president, has the power to implement such a cap. Similar proposals have previously stalled on Capitol Hill.\n\nMajor banks, including JPMorgan Chase, UBS, and Citi, warned that a 10% cap could reduce access to credit; others in the financial sector applauded the plan.\n\nHere is how business leaders have responded so far\n\nKlarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski backs Trump's plan.\n\nSiemiatkowski told CNBC in an interview on Monday that traditional credit cards are built to encourage consumers to put most of their spending on credit, and then carry big balances at steep interest rates. That dynamic, he said, pushes people to borrow more than they should and results in higher losses, especially among lower-income borrowers.\n\n\"I think Trump is wise here and is proposing something that makes a lot of sense,\" Siemiatkowski told CNBC on Monday.\n\n\"Capitalism is great, but anarchy is not,\" Siemiatkowski added regarding consumer protection.\n\nIn another interview with CNN, Siemiatkowski also said that credit card rewards like cash back and airline miles largely benefit wealthier consumers while lower-income cardholders shoulder more of the costs.\n\nJPMorgan's CFO said that Trump's plan could upend the company's business model.\n\n\"It's a very competitive business, but we wouldn't be in it if it weren't a good business for us,\" said Jeremy Barnum during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"And in a world where price controls make it no longer a good business, that would present a significant challenge.\"\n\nJPMorgan said on its fourth-quarter earnings call that debit and credit card sales volume rose roughly 7% year over year and described the business as central to its retail-focused offerings.\n\nThe CEO of JPMorgan also weighed in on Trump's credit card proposal.\n\nJamie Dimon told investors on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call that reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit.\n\n\"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"This is a mistake, President,\" Bill Ackman, the billionaire CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, wrote on Friday on X in a now-deleted post.\n\n\"Without being able to charge rates adequate enough to cover losses and to earn an adequate return on equity, credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks for credit at rates higher than and on terms inferior to what they previously paid,\" Ackman added.\n\nAckman said in another post on Saturday that although Trump's goal is one that's \"worthy and important,\" the rate cap is not the way to achieve it.\n\n\"The best way to bring down rates would be to make it more competitive by making the regulatory regime more conducive to new entrants and new technologies,\" Ackman wrote.\n\nThe SoFi CEO believes that his business and consumers could stand to benefit from Trump's credit card rate cap.\n\n\"If this is enacted — and that's a big if, though part of me hopes it is — we would likely see a significant contraction in industry credit card lending,\" Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X. \"Credit card issuers simply won't be able to sustain profitability at a 10% rate cap.\"\n\n\"Consumers, however, will still need access to credit. That creates a large void — one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto added.\n\nNoto also said that personal loans could be an alternative to addressing debt, though that would make underwriting discipline and borrower education \"even more important.\"",

    "title": "Trump's sweeping proposals for credit cards and student debt could be a big deal for other lenders",
    "description": "With Trump's proposed cap on credit card interest rates and new caps on student loans, more Americans might turn to alternative lenders.",
    "fullText": "More Americans might find themselves turning to personal and private loans this year.\n\nProposed changes to the lending market could impact banks and consumers starting this year, particularly in two of the largest areas of consumer debt: credit cards and student loans. Private and personal lending firms could end up big winners if those changes stick.\n\nOn the student debt side, President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation called for new borrowing caps on graduate and professional loans in an attempt to curb excessive borrowing. It also eliminated the Grad and Parent PLUS programs, which allowed parents and graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nMore recently, Trump proposed a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, which he said would prevent credit card companies from \"ripping off\" consumers.\n\nThe changes to student loan borrowing are set to take effect in July, while it's unclear if Trump's credit card proposal will come to fruition, as its most likely path would be through congressional legislation.\n\nSome policy experts and lenders have said that the caps on rates could mean banks reduce credit card offerings, and caps on student loan borrowing could drive consumers to private loans to help fill the gap.\n\nAs the cost of living continues to rise in the US, personal loans, credit card debt, and student debt are already at record highs. While the benefit of a personal loan is that its flexible terms allow it to be used for a wide range of purposes, interest rates vary depending on credit scores, similar to credit cards.\n\nSimilarly, taking on private student loans could also be riskier than federal financing because their interest rates are often variable, meaning the rate could increase or decrease over the loan's lifetime.\n\nA joint statement from several banking associations said that the cap on credit card interest \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans.\n\nOn Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase's CFO said that if the interest cap were to take effect, it may not be worth it for the bank to be in the credit card business. Similarly, student borrowers without sufficient financing for their programs may turn to private lending.\n\nPersonal lending company SoFi is an example of a company that could benefit from both policies. CEO Anthony Noto wrote in a post on X that, should Trump's credit card cap proposal be implemented, consumers would need access to more credit.\n\n\"That creates a large void—one that @SoFi personal loans are well positioned to fill,\" Noto said.\n\nNoto also said during an August earnings call that the elimination of Grad and Parent PLUS loans could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\" Private lender Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed a similar idea during an earnings call: \"Grad PLUS elimination is a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\"\n\nA SoFi spokesperson told Business Insider that the company prioritizes affordability, \"and providing members with a more accessible and safer path to financial independence.\"\n\nAn analysis by credit reporting firm TransUnion found that unsecured personal loan balances reached record highs in the third quarter of 2025, totaling $269 billion.\n\nThe accumulation of debt is a concern shared by some policy experts and lawmakers, particularly regarding student loans. In August, Sen. Elizabeth Warren led some of her colleagues in sending letters to the major private student-loan lenders asking for information on how they plan to protect borrowers in anticipation of an influx into the private lending market.\n\n\"Student debt places a tremendous burden on borrowers, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy, driving employment, spending, and housing decisions that have long-lasting negative impacts on borrowers' financial health,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Placing a greater share of student loans into the hands of private lenders threatens to make these problems much worse.\"",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Brnovich, Arizona's top law enforcement officer when the state became the epicenter of efforts by President Donald Trump and his allies to find proof that the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has died. He was 59.\n\nBrnovich died after having a heart attack Monday, Katie Conner, a representative of the family, said Tuesday.\n\nColleagues and friends of Brnovich praised him for his work in public service that included stints as a judge, a prosecutor, lawyer and the director of the Arizona Department of Gaming. Former Republican Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey said Brnovich's passion for the law, justice and victims were hallmarks of his career.\n\n“For those of us blessed to call him a friend, his humor, positivity, and happy warrior spirit were infectious. May he rest in peace,” Ducey said on the social platform X.\n\nBrnovich, a Republican, was in his second term as attorney general in Arizona when his office investigated the 2020 election. Arizona was among the states Joe Biden won that year to deny Trump reelection to the presidency.\n\nBrnovich released an interim report in April 2022 that outlined his concerns with some election procedures but did not provide any proof of major issues despite six months of investigation.\n\nAt the time, Brnovich was seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. Senate seat and facing fierce criticism from Trump, who claimed he wasn’t doing enough to prosecute election fraud. Brnovich wanted an endorsement from Trump but didn't get it.\n\nWhen current Attorney General Kris Mayes took office, she revealed that Brnovich suppressed findings from his investigators. Mayes said the records showed the 2020 election “was conducted fairly and accurately by election officials.”\n\nThe documents she released also showed Brnovich withheld a separate memo that systematically refuted election conspiracies that took root on the right, including allegations of dead or duplicate voters, pre-marked ballots flown in from Asia, election servers connected to the internet and even manipulation by satellites controlled by the Italian military.\n\nMayes posted on X that she was saddened to hear of Brnovich's sudden passing and said he dedicated many years to public service. She offered condolences to his wife Susan and their family.\n\nBrnovich lost the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in 2021. In a video launching his campaign, Brnovich described himself as the son of immigrants who fled communism in Yugoslavia. He said he used his post as attorney general to take on “crony capitalists” and government overreach, while promoting religious liberty, border security and election integrity.\n\nIn April, Trump nominated Brnovich to be ambassador to Serbia but withdrew his nomination in October.",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil landed an interview with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and one of the unusual moments came when the president talked of what would have happened if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election.\n\nThe president was claiming Harris would have continued what he called a “mess” of an economy under Joe Biden.\n\nTony Dokoupil’s First Week As ‘CBS Evening News’ Anchor Down Year Over Year; ‘World News Tonight’ Tops Viewers, ‘Nightly News’ Wins 25-54 Demo\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nNew 'CBS Evening News' Anchor Tony Dokoupil To Interview Donald Trump\n\n“You wouldn’t have a job right now, if she got in. You probably wouldn’t have a job right now,” Trump told Dokoupil during the interview, conducted on the floor of a Ford plant in Detroit.\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nThen the president appeared to refer to David Ellison, who became CEO of Paramount last year after his Skydance bought the CBS parent company. Ellison’s father, Larry, is a longtime supporter of the president’s.\n\n“Your boss is an amazing guy,” Trump said. “Might be bust. Okay. Might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn’t have this job. You wouldn’t have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they are paying you.”\n\nDokoupil later said that “I do think I’d have this job even if the other guy won.”\n\n“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump responded.\n\nThe Evening News ran the entirety of the interview, Dokoupil said, and it lasted about 15 minutes.\n\nDuring the conversation Trump talked about taking “very strong action” against Iran if the regime hangs protesters amid the unrest that has spread throughout the country. The president, though, was not specific about what that meant. At other points, Dokoupil let some of Trump’s claims go unchallenged, including that he “ended eight wars.” That has been challenged as hyperbole from the AP and other fact-checking sites.\n\nTrump also claimed that “there’s no inflation,” and later said that he had them “down to a level that they haven’t seen in about nine years.” In fact, consumer prices rose about 2.7% in December, according to the Department of Labor, and inflation was below 2% during points of Trump’s first term. The CBS Evening News anchor noted that “when I travel the country and I go all over the place and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don’t feel it.”\n\n“I’ve only been here for 11 months, okay,” Trump responded, before saying that he “inherited a mess” and that “we have now the hottest country in the world.”\n\nThe most revelatory part of the interview may have been when Dokoupil questioned Trump about the shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent last week.\n\nDokoupil noted that he spoke to Good’s father, who is “a big supporter of yours.”\n\n“He’s heartbroken because his daughter is dead. He’s also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she’s a domestic terrorist. What do you want to say to her father right now?”\n\nTrump answered, “Well, I want to say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side, as you say. He might be on my side.”\n\nDokoupil said, “He’s on your side.”\n\nTrump replied, “And I think that’s great … and I would bet you that she under normal circumstances was a very solid, wonderful person, but pretty tough.” He then went on to defend ICE and blast Joe Biden, before going back to the video of Good’s killing, and acknowledging that the videos are open to interpretation. Soon after the killing, the Department of Homeland Security quickly said that Good was trying to strike the ICE officer with her vehicle.\n\n“When you look at that tape, it can be viewed two ways, I guess,” Trump said. “But when you look at the way that was, that car was pulled away. There are a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States accused Russia on Monday of a “dangerous and inexplicable escalation” of its nearly four-year war in Ukraine at a time when the Trump administration is trying to advance negotiations toward peace.\n\nU.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations Tammy Bruce singled out Russia’s launch of a nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile last week close to Ukraine’s border with Poland, a NATO ally.\n\nShe told an emergency meeting of the Security Council that the United States deplores “the staggering number of casualties” in the conflict and condemns Russia’s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.\n\nUkraine called for the meeting after last Thursday’s overnight Russian bombardment with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, including the powerful, new hypersonic Oreshnik missile, which Moscow used for only the second time in what was a clear warning to Kyiv’s NATO allies.\n\nThe large-scale attack came days after Ukraine and its allies reported major progress toward agreeing on how to defend the country from further Moscow aggression if a U.S.-led peace deal is struck.\n\nThe attack also coincided with a new chill in relations between Moscow and Washington after Russia condemned the U.S. seizure of an oil tanker in the North Atlantic. And it came as U.S. President Donald Trump signaled he is on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Russia.\n\nMoscow has given no public signal it is willing to budge from its maximalist demands on Ukraine. And Russia's U.N. ambassador on Monday blamed the diplomatic impasse on Ukraine.\n\nEurope’s leaders condemned the attack using the Oreshnik as “escalatory and unacceptable,” and U.S. envoy Bruce was equally tough on Monday.\n\n“At a moment of tremendous potential, due only to President Trump’s unparalleled commitment to peace around the world, both sides should be seeking ways to de-escalate,” she said. “Yet Russia’s action risks expanding and intensifying the war.”\n\nBruce reminded Russia that nearly a year ago it voted in favor of a Security Council resolution calling for an end to the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n“It would be nice if Russia matched their words with deeds,” she said. “In the spirit of that resolution, Russia, Ukraine and Europe must pursue peace seriously and bring this nightmare to an end.”\n\nBut Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council that until Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “comes to his senses and agrees to realistic conditions for negotiations, we will continue solving the problem by military means.”\n\n“He was warned long ago, with each passing day, each day which he squanders, the conditions for negotiations will only get worse for him,” Nebenzia said. “Similarly, each vile attack on Russian civilians will elicit a stiff response.”\n\nUkraine’s U.N. Ambassador Andriy Melnyk countered that Russia is more vulnerable now than at any time since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Its economy is slowing and oil revenue is down.\n\n“Russia wants to sell to this council and the whole U.N. family the impression that it is invincible, but this is another illusion,” he told the council. “The carefully staged image of strength is nothing but smoke and mirrors, completely detached from reality.”",

    "description": "Mark Zandi told Business Insider that the idea to cap credit card interest would hurt borrowers, while Trump's mortgage plan could raise home prices.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has floated some big ideas to make life more affordable for everyday Americans in the last week, but one veteran economist has his doubts that they'll make much of a difference.\n\nIn fact, he sees the plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest as potentially doing more harm than good.\n\nTrump revealed plans to bring down mortgage rates and make credit card debt cheaper. For mortgages, he said he had directed \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion of mortgage bonds, while his plan for credit cards entails capping interest at 10% for a year.\n\nThe president framed both plans as being in the interest of US consumers, but Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi thinks that both moves could end up having the opposite effect.\n\nZandi spent much of 2025 sounding the alarm over Trump's policies, which he said could push the US toward a recession, and he's remained pessimistic so far in 2026.\n\nZandi posted on X that the news of Trump's housing market plan has already pushed fixed mortgages down by 10 to 20 basis points. While that sounds like good news for borrowers and is likely exactly what Trump wants to see, the sudden dip in rates could ultimately drive home prices up.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this will do little to make homebuying more affordable, as while the lower rates will support housing demand, given the severe housing shortage, it will also result in higher house prices, all else equal,\" he said.\n\nZandi also warned that Trump's intention to use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pile up mortgage bonds could pose further complications. He said it would effectively weaken a safeguard imposed on the two mortgage giants following the 2008 housing market crash that was meant to keep them from posing a systemic risk to the economy.\n\nZandi also said he had issues with Trump's credit card idea.\n\nHe told Business Insider that while he sees little chance that Trump's plan for a cap on credit card interest rates would clear legal hurdles, the move would ultimately curtail the availability of credit for borrowers who rely on it.\n\n\"Only consumers with high credit scores would avoid having their credit lines reduced or eliminated altogether,\" he said. \"That's because banks and other credit card lenders simply won't be able to profitably extend credit cards at a 10% rate to many Americans.\"\n\nZandi predicted that higher-income households would benefit from lower rates middle and lower income people would be shut out.\n\nAnalysts at UBS echoed Zandi's perspective on credit card rate caps, arguing that caps on credit card interest could harm not just lower-income consumers but the broader economy, as it would mean less spending. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman responded with a similar argument, stating that he thinks such a move would be a mistake.",

    "title": "Trump’s Slash-and-Burn Economy Is Devastating Black Women",
    "description": "Kali...",
    "fullText": "His administration is hitting them with “discriminate harm.”\n\nElections have consequences—and they are, unfailingly, most profoundly visited upon Black women. Donald Trump’s reelection has had the consequence of Black women being pushed out of their workplaces at astonishing rates. Between February and July of last year, Black women lost 319,000 jobs in both the private and public sectors, driven largely by mass layoffs in education, healthcare, and housing. During that same period, white women gained 142,000 jobs, Hispanic women 176,000 jobs, and white men—wait for it!—picked up 365,000 jobs. In February, Black women’s unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent, but that figure had soared to 6.7 percent by August. In September, the most recent snapshot available because of the shutdown, yet another 0.8 percent of Black women lost their jobs—while just 0.2 percent of white women suffered the same fate that month. All in all, according to the gender economist Katica Roy, roughly 600,000 Black women have been “economically sidelined” since February—which was, not coincidentally, this president’s first full month in office.\n\nThis has failed to set off alarm bells in a country that has never cared much about the well-being of Black women. Perhaps that’s why concerned policymakers and economists so often take such pains to emphasize that Black women’s economic distress is a bellwether for everyone else—to underline that their fates, and even their humanity, are connected to the nation’s in the hopes that the country might finally care. And it’s not just that racism and sexism make Black women the first to be let go when the economy stalls—it’s also that Black women power the economy in ways this country often refuses to acknowledge. Nearly 70 percent of Black mothers are the breadwinners in their homes, though they’re paid just 34, 44, or 52 cents of every dollar paid to Asian, white, or Black breadwinner dads, respectively. So when they lose jobs en masse, families are left financially vulnerable and local economies are weakened. Nationally, the cost has already surpassed $37 billion in lost GDP.\n\nBut it’s disingenuous to suggest that Black women are merely hit the hardest during economic slumps when, in fact, they’ve been targeted for harm by a right wing that is openly committed to undoing their progress. This country has—again—chosen to meet gender and racial advancement with aggressive rollbacks, including dismantling institutions that have provided Black women with financial security and career advancement. It’s not a coincidence that the first move of the Trump administration, in partnership with Elon Musk’s DOGE, was to vilify and hollow out the civil service—long an engine of Black middle-class stability—where Black women make up 12 percent of staffers, double their portion of the overall workforce. A National Women’s Law Center study found that women and people of color made up the majority of the workforce in the agencies that sustained the deepest cuts. The Department of Education, with a workforce of 28 percent Black women, lost 46 percent of its staff. The Department of Justice and the Department of Energy, both of which are about 70 percent white? Cut by just 1 percent and 13 percent, respectively, according to a ProPublica analysis.\n\nThe Trump administration has also made a show of pushing out high-profile Black women leaders, including Carla Hayden at the Library of Congress, Gwynne Wilcox at the National Labor Relations Board, and the ongoing effort to oust Lisa Cook at the Federal Reserve. Peggy Carr has described her abrupt dismissal after 35 years of climbing the ranks at the Department of Education as a “tragedy” both personal and professional. “It was like I was being taken out like the trash,” Carr told The New York Times of being escorted out of the building by a security guard, “the only difference is I was being taken out the front door rather than the back door.”\n\nThose public-sector layoffs have been accompanied by attacks on private-sector diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI. NPR reports that roles in DEI plummeted from 20,000 in 2023 to 17,500 in April 2025. Companies too numerous to name have hastily retreated from DEI efforts they had boasted about earlier, and not because they are mandated to, since Trump’s anti-DEI executive orders cannot overturn civil-rights laws or dictate the hiring practices of private businesses. A New York Times investigation found that the number of S&P 500 companies that include DEI language in their financial filings is down 60 percent since 2024. And for the first time since 2017, the majority of new directors hired at S&P 500 companies this year were white men.\n\nBlack women have long worked at rates higher than other American women, including as recently as 2024. But even in the best of times, intertwined sexism and anti-Black racism, or misogynoir, consign them to the most precarious jobs in the least recession-proof sectors. Across industries, they are paid less than white men with the same—and even, in some comparisons, lower—levels of education; are least likely of all women to be promoted; and leave college burdened with the most student-loan debt. Now Trump has launched what Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) rightly calls a campaign of “discriminate harm” against them. History vividly illustrates what the consequences will be. After economic downturns in the early 1980s, the Great Recession of the aughts, and the Covid pandemic, Black women were the last to recover financially. But this time, the Trump administration has scrubbed race-based employment data from government websites—preemptively erasing evidence of the harms it’s inflicting.\n\nWhen Black women voted against this regime, they were fighting for their lives at the ballot box, knowing they’d be the first to bear the brunt of its damages—and fully aware they wouldn’t be the last. It was, of course, not enough to stop a country unwilling to heed their warnings. So once again we’re trapped, forced to inhale the noxious fumes no one else notices are poisoning us all.",

    "description": "The market reaction to Trump's latest attack on the Fed wasn't as sharp this time.",
    "fullText": "Even by his own market-moving standards, President Trump has been on a real tear lately.\n\nIt's been just over a week since he sent oil stocks surging by imploring US drillers to invest in the revitalization of Venezuela.\n\nAnd it's only been a few days since he stirred up volatility in defense stocks by first demanding they stop buybacks and dividends, then smoothing things over by pledging $1.5 trillion in military spending.\n\nThe Trump administration's latest major market disruption started on Sunday, on news the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to the Fed over a testimony from Jerome Powell on building renovations.\n\nIf there's one thing the market has shown in recent years, it's that it doesn't like any sort of challenge to Fed independence. The standard rebellious response to this, over time, has been the \"Sell America\" trade, which sees traders dump US stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar.\n\nWhat transpired on Monday was hardly the most drastic \"Sell America\" event we've had (and we've had a few at this point). But it still sets high stakes for the three asset classes in question:\n\nAfter an initial knee-jerk reaction sharply lower, major US indexes finished the day slightly higher. It was a more muted reaction than we've seen after past Fed attacks.\n\nPerhaps investors are already invoking the TACO trade, and expecting Trump to \"chicken out\" and temper his stance. It's also possible that, at this point, they're simply used to Powell brushing off Trump and forging ahead. Plus he also only has four months left in his term.\n\nA client note from the JPMorgan Securities trading desk stressed caution around stocks in the wake of the DOJ subpoenas. The firm said the latest threats make the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on Trump's ability to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook even more important.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose as much as 4 basis points on Monday before paring the increase. This is a common reaction under the \"sell America\" trade as investors dump US-denominated debt. Still, like with stocks, the reaction was minor.\n\nGiven the lack of reaction, attention is instead focused on last week's December jobs report. The data prompted JPMorgan's chief US economist to adjust his rate-cut forecast. He now expects zero cuts in 2026, and a rate hike in 2027.\n\nIf the \"Sell America\" narrative persists in any form — and if the market eventually agrees the Fed's rate-cut voyage is truly over — expect yields to rise again.\n\nThe dollar index — which assesses the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — fell as much as 0.5% on Monday. Divesting from the dollar is a core element of the \"Sell America\" trade.\n\nThe dollar is fresh off being the worst-performing major currency of 2025. While a weak currency comes with some positives — like a nation's exports being worth more — it can also reflect a lack of faith in its financial system.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump isn't backing down from his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, even as an increasing number of fellow Republicans express a desire to cool tensions.\n\n\"Well, he's billions of dollars over budget,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday morning before departing for a trip to Michigan. \"So, he's either incompetent or he's crooked. I don't know what he is, but he certainly doesn't do a very good job.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Powell released an extraordinary video statement, confirming that he is under a criminal investigation for testimony he gave before Congress about renovations to the Fed's headquarters. Powell said that the probe was being conducted in retaliation for his repeated defiance of Trump's wishes regarding the independent central bank's setting of interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a nearly two-minute video released by the Fed.\n\nPowell and the Fed have repeatedly denied that there is anything untoward about the cost overruns for the $2.5 billion renovations. In July, Powell accompanied Trump on a tour of the site where the pair sparred in front of reporters about the project.\n\n\"You just added in a third building is what that is,\" Powell said in July after Trump cited a figure that was higher than other estimates. \"It was built five years ago.\"\n\nAn FAQ on the Fed's website said the project has been costlier than expected due to a number of factors, including changes to the design, a larger-than-expected amount of asbestos, and the increase in the cost of materials.\n\nTrump told NBC News he had no knowledge of grand jury subpoenas being sent to the Fed. Amid a firestorm, US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said that the Justice Department had no alternative but to subpoena the information.\n\n\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro said in a statement posted on X on Monday night.\n\nIn 2017, Trump nominated Powell, who was already a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, to lead the central bank. Since then, Trump has soured on Powell and at times has mused about firing the Fed chair, though legal experts have disputed whether any president would have the power to do so.\n\nThe criminal probe into Powell could prove costly for the White House. Powell's term as chair is up in May. For months, Trump has conducted a public search for his replacement. In a closely-divided Senate, Trump cannot afford to lose Republican support for any potential nominee.\n\nAfter Powell's statement was released, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said he would not support any Trump nominee until the investigation \"is fully resolved.\" Tillis serves on the Senate Banking Committee, where Republicans hold a 13-11 majority. If Tillis remained opposed, the committee could deadlock — likely stalling the nomination or, at the very least, requiring Republicans to take the rare step of changing the chamber's rules.\n\nBeyond Tillis, a handful of other Republicans on Capitol Hill have also decried the criminal probe. All three living former Fed chairs, including Reagan appointee Alan Greenspan, have lined up behind Powell, as have the current leaders of central banks around the world.",

    "fullText": "MS NOW host Rachel Maddow taunted President Donald Trump over a series of recent failures and rebukes from courts and even some Republicans on a variety of issues.\n\nThe second term of Trump’s presidency has seen a steady erosion of support over issues like the Epstein files and rebukes from federal courts over a raft of policies. But those rebukes have picked up pace recently.\n\nOn Monday night’s edition of MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, the host ticked through the latest of them. She then gloated that Trump “is losing all the time and everywhere now”:\n\nYou might not have seen the headline today that today a federal court blocked the Trump administration from cutting energy funding just for blue states. This is billions of dollars Congress appropriated for clean energy projects of various kinds all over the country.\n\nTrump administration decided, and they admitted this — they decided that just in blue states, just in states that didn’t vote for Trump, they would cut all of that funding. They’d leave the funding in place in states that voted for Trump. They would cut it in states that didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nA federal court today ruled that that is illegal and stopped the Trump administration from doing that. That ruling today came after another federal court today stopped Trump from shutting down a big offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Trump’s shutdown of that project, according to the courts today, was also illegal.\n\nAnd so, yet another federal court blocked Trump on that as well. So that work on the wind farm will be able to go ahead. Both of those rulings today follow.\n\nLast night, yet another federal court blocking Trump, this time from cutting funding to the American academy of pediatrics. This is a doctor’s group of pediatricians group that criticized the flock of ducks level insane quackery at Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services under RFK Jr.\n\nTrump responded by canceling federal grants for the American Academy of Pediatrics. A judge has now ruled that that was illegal retaliation. And so, Trump is blocked from doing that. That funding has to be reinstated.\n\nThat ruling comes after another federal judge just blocked Trump from cutting off federal election funds to states in retaliation for them not changing their election rules in ways that Trump wants. The judge said, quote, “the Constitution assigns no authority to the president over federal election administration.” And so, Trump got blocked on that one, too.\n\nShall I keep going? I could keep going. Another federal court just blocked Trump from freezing billions of dollars for childcare and social services for kids, again, in Democratic run states, as some kind of punishment against those states for electing Democrats, punishing them for that by cutting off the temporary assistance to needy families program.\n\nBecause, you know, you know, what would Jesus do? Trump was also just blocked from a — from doing that by yet another federal court.\n\nIt`s almost like he is losing all the time and everywhere now. There may still be people in America who are shocked that Trump keeps breaking the law over and over again, blatantly and insistently. The courts no longer appear to be shocked by that, and the courts now are just telling him no very bluntly, every single day, and often multiple times a day.\n\nAnd it’s not even just the courts, as I know you are aware, last week in one 48-hour stretch, we had a Senate vote for a War Powers resolution to block Trump from any further military adventurism. In Venezuela, five Republican senators crossed over to side with Democrats to pass that War Powers resolution. It was enough to advance that it’s going to get another vote in the Senate this week.\n\nThat came right on the heels of 17 Republicans in the House breaking ranks with Trump and siding with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act to try to, at least temporarily, undo the disastrous decision Trump and Republicans made in their so-called big beautiful bill. The decision to send tens of thousands of American families’ health insurance rates through the roof.\n\nSeventeen Republicans crossed over, defied Trump and joined with Democrats to pass that health care matter in the House.\n\nNow it`s going to come to the senate. Trump is now whining about how he might have to veto it if and when it passes in the senate as well, because he definitely wants to make sure that people’s health insurance premiums double or triple in cost for nothing other than something that he personally did. He apparently wants that.\n\nI mean, what we’ve just seen in Congress is one of the worst rebukes Trump has had from congressional Republicans since he has been back in office this whole disastrous year.\n\nWatch above via MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nThe post MS NOW’s Rachel Maddow Taunts Trump Over Blizzard of Defeats: ‘Losing All the Time and Everywhere!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Sources in touch with Bondi told the Journal that she was growing increasingly concerned about Trump’s complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department has brought charges against several Trump antagonists, but prosecutors have faced substantial setbacks.\n\nThe government is appealing November’s dismissals of its cases against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey after a judge ruled that Trump had illegally appointed Lindsey Halligan, the attorney who obtained those indictments.\n\nSince that ruling, the Trump administration has tried and failed on two separate occasions to persuade a grand jury to indict James.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, was indicted in October for allegedly mishandling classified documents. A trial date has yet to be determined.\n\nYet another investigation was revealed on Sunday. The Justice Department is now probing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about the bank’s building renovation.\n\nAccording to Trump, Bondi is also coming up short when it comes to the Epstein files, which have long cast a shadow over his presidency. That the government has produced less than 1 percent of its files, despite a law requiring their release last month, has only intensified scrutiny over the Trump-Epstein relationship and the president’s handling of it.\n\nThe Journal cites two officials who said that Trump agreed with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles’ assessment to Vanity Fair that Bondi “whiffed” on the issue.\n\nTrump’s obsession with the 2020 election has also led him to demand more from the Justice Department, according to the report.\n\nLast month, Trump resorted to issuing a symbolic pardon of Tina Peters, the former Colorado county elections clerk convicted of seven state charges, including tampering with voting machines. Peters remains in prison serving a nine-year sentence.\n\nTrump has occasionally confronted Bondi directly about his list of grievances, officials told the Journal.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House provided statements from Trump, Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—all praising Bondi.\n\n“Pam is doing an excellent job,” said Trump.\n\n“She has been my friend for many years,” he added. “Tremendous progress is being made against radical left lunatics who are good at only one thing, cheating in elections and the crimes they commit.”\n\nThe Justice Department, in a brief statement, did not address the substance of the Journal’s report, telling the Daily Beast merely that Bondi “is focused on executing President Trump’s directive to Make America Safe Again.”",

    "fullText": "As the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement nationwide, a wave of high-profile arrests — many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video — has pushed one legal question into the center of the national debate: When can federal immigration agents lawfully enter private property to make an arrest?\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency in cities like Minneapolis, where thousands of federal agents are operating on the streets amid protests, confrontations and a fatal shooting, sharpening scrutiny of the legal authority immigration officers rely on when they arrive at the front door.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is a legal distinction largely unfamiliar to the public but central to immigration enforcement.\n\nMost immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only criminal warrants signed by judges carry that authority. Legal experts say the administration’s aggressive enforcement push, combined with public awareness of those limits, is increasingly turning door-knock encounters into flashpoints, fueling confrontations that are now playing out in cities across the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the limitations on the warrants that authorize most immigration related arrests.\n\nImmigration warrants typically don't authorize entry onto private property\n\nAll law enforcement operations — including those conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means law enforcement is required to have a warrant before searching one's private property or arresting someone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nBut not all warrants are the same. Typically, arrests carried out by Department of Homeland Security agencies are authorized by administrative warrants — sometimes known as immigration warrants — not judicial warrants.\n\nJudicial warrants are issued by a court and signed by a magistrate or a state or federal judge. These warrants allow a relevant law enforcement agency to apprehend a specified individual in any context — regardless of whether the person is on public or on private property. In other words, law enforcement is legally allowed to enter and search a home or business to make the arrest without the consent of the property owner once a judge signs off on the arrest.\n\nThat means people can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant.\n\nThere are limited exceptions, some of which include if someone is in immediate danger, an officer is actively chasing a suspect or if someone is calling for help inside the residence. But those exceptions don't apply in routine immigration arrests, legal experts say.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former ICE acting director, said officers are trained on what circumstances legally justify forced entry. But as the scope of ICE's work has expanded, and more Border Patrol agents have begun conducting the work of ICE officers, there is a greater chance that agents will misapply the rules, he said.\n\n“Your risks of all of these types of incidents increase dramatically when you take officers out of their normal operating environment and ask them to do things that they have not been trained to do, because it’s not part of their core missions,” Sandweg said.\n\nMounting tensions in Minneapolis\n\nThe thorny legal distinction between judicial and administrative warrants came to the fore on Sunday when immigration law enforcement raided a private home to make an arrest in Minneapolis, after clashing with protesters who confronted the heavily armed agents. Documents reviewed by The Associated Press revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge that authorized the raid on private property.\n\nWhen asked, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin didn't provide a legal justification for the forced entry and arrest of the man, who is a Liberian national with a deportation order from 2023. She said his arrest was part of the administration's efforts to arrest “the worst of the worst” and added that he had that a criminal history including “robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.\"\n\nMcLaughlin didn't specify whether he was convicted of any of those crimes, or whether his arrest was related to any criminal activity.\n\nVice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, Heidi Altman, said she couldn’t comment on that specific raid, but said that generally an officer entering a home without consent or permission could result in serious consequences.\n\n“That is not just an illegal arrest. It’s numerous illegal actions by the officer themselves that could open up liability, not just for being sued, but potential criminal actions under state law as well,” she explained.\n\nBut in the current political climate, Altman said, it isn’t clear if there are any realistic avenues for accountability since the federal government would be responsible for investigating such a breech.\n\n“There are layers of federal laws and regulations and policies prohibiting this kind of behavior. But then the second layer is: Is the federal government going to impose consequences?\" she said.\n\nOn top of that, immigrants have less recourse after an illegal arrest or search, since the illegally obtained evidence can still be used in immigration court. It’s called the exclusionary rule, Altman explained, and the consequences that the officer may face would not undo the immediate consequences immigrants could face if they are quickly deported.\n\n“As those legal challenges come and people are facing very, very quick detentions and deportations on the basis of these illegal arrests, there’s very little recourse in actual immigration court proceedings that allows people to have a judge disregard evidence or the actual arrest, even if it was done in this very violent, illegal manner,” Altman said.\n\nICE has long relied on “knock and talks\" to make apprehensions, informally requesting residents to leave a home without giving any indication they plan to make an immigration arrest. As outlined in a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal, officers tell their targets that they need them to step outside to answer a few questions. In one case, they told a woman that they were probation officers looking for her brother.\n\nIn response, activists, lawyers and local governments have launched “know-your-rights” campaigns around the country, attempting to educate people on the legal nuances of the extremely convoluted legal framework that is supposed to govern immigration law enforcement.\n\nMany groups have published fact sheets and infographics on social media, while others facilitate meetings that go over constitutional protections that immigrants have — regardless of legal status — in interactions with federal agents.\n\nOften groups will instruct immigrants to request to see a warrant before opening the door if an immigration officer knocks. The trainings also typically emphasize that an immigrant can refuse to open the door if law enforcement only has an administrative warrant.",

    "description": "Americans' debt loads are at record highs, resurfacing a decadeslong debate on how to prevent companies from maximizing profit at consumers' expense.",
    "fullText": "Americans are racking up credit card debt, and it's costing them even more to get rid of it.\n\nIt's a piece of the affordability debate that has caught the attention of both parties.\n\nIn a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. He wrote in a Truth Social post that he would call for the cap to begin on January 20.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen.\n\nWarren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she \"told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"\n\nHowever, beyond the mechanics of the proposal, the underlying sentiment — that credit card companies have \"ripped off\" consumers by charging excessive interest — is an issue that has plagued the US for decades as debt loads continue to rise.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nTrump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move.\n\nIn February 2025, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that \"working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon.\"\n\nEven as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances.\n\nIt's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said.\n\n\"Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that,\" Rust said.\n\nAt the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nThere's limited legal recourse for consumers. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.\n\nOversight over the industry is lacking, especially after the Trump administration moved to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB conducts oversight of the industry and found, in a 2023 report, that credit-card companies charged consumers over $105 billion in interest in 2022, helping to boost their profit margins from 4.5% in 2019 to 5.9%.\n\nSome credit-card companies took issue with Trump's proposal. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the \"cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans. Banks typically use higher interest rates to compensate for customers who might not be able to pay back their loans.",

    "description": "The criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to further complicate Donald Trump's timeline for naming his replacement.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's search to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has taken a major turn in the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Powell confirmed an explosive report that he is facing a criminal investigation related to his prior testimony to Congress about the $2.5 billion renovation to the Fed's headquarters.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell said that the probe was in retaliation for his decision to ignore Trump's wishes on rate cuts.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.\n\nTrump told NBC News that he had nothing to do with the grand jury subpoenas sent to the Fed, adding that Powell is \"certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.\"\n\nNews of the probe has complicated Trump's path to replacing Powell, whose term ends in May.\n\nHere's where Trump's search stands and who is on top of his list.\n\nKevin Hassett, one of Trump's top economic advisors, has long been considered a likely pick to replace Powell.\n\nAs of January, Hassett is tied with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, at 40% for the odds of being Trump's pick at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nAsked about the criminal probe into Powell, Hassett said it made sense to investigate why the Fed's renovations overran their initial cost estimates. (The Fed has said costs went up due to changes in design, the increase in cost of materials, and unforeseen complications such as a larger amount of asbestos than anticipated.)\n\n\"I think that it's really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that,\" Hassett told reporters outside the White House on January 12.\n\nBefore joining Trump's orbit, Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020.\n\nIn October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman \"Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.\" Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold.\n\nTrump has long praised Warsh, the other Kevin on his shortlist to replace Powell.\n\nIn December, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Warsh was at the top of his list.\n\n\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both—I think the two Kevins are great,\" he told the publication. \"I think there are a couple of other people that are great.\"\n\nMonths earlier, Trump told reporters that Hassett, Warsh, and current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller were \"the top three.\"\n\nIn leading prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, Warsh's odds surged in mid-December, then shrank, and are now trending higher once again.\n\nBack in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017.\n\nWarsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House.\n\nDrawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street.\n\nFrom the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\n\n\"The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them,\" Warsh told CNBC in July. \"So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.\"\n\nFed Gov. Christopher Waller, who currently serves alongside Powell on the central bank, has previously said that he thought his interview went well.\n\nIn late November, Waller told Fox News he was pleased about his conversation with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led Trump's search process.\n\nIn mid-December, CNBC reported that unnamed senior administration officials said Waller had a \"strong interview\" with Trump himself.\n\nDespite optimism in the press, Waller's odds have collapsed in leading prediction markets. As of January, Waller is under 10% at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nWaller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's.\n\nIn December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times.\n\nIn July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years.\n\nThere's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist.\n\nRick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman was once thought to be a potential contender, but hasn't received the same buzz as other hopefuls in recent months.\n\nIn 2018, Trump appointed Bowman to the central bank.\n\nAfter confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision.\n\nBowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official.\n\nIn September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent.\n\nTrump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names.\n\nCNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James \"Jim\" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention.",

    "fullText": "A picture is worth a thousand words. A video makes a statement.\n\nFacing down the threat of a potential criminal indictment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn't write a press release.\n\nInstead, he turned to the camera, literally, to respond to what he described as the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nThe choice was out of character for Powell, who's known for measured, not reactionary, responses during his Fed tenure. But the video enabled Powell to project calm while also signaling the significance of the moment, communication and leadership experts told BI's Ana Altcheck and Tim Paradis.\n\n(If you need a refresher, here's the backstory on Powell's Senate testimony that's the basis for the DOJ probe.)\n\nPowell's response is worth examining as President Donald Trump continues to pick fights across the business world. Look no further than the oil industry, where Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela after its CEO said the country is currently \"uninvestable.\"\n\nIt's a strategy we've seen before from Trump.\n\n\"Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen,\" writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nIt's also part of a new form of capitalism that Trump is ushering in, including the government sometimes taking stakes in individual companies and leaning on public offices meant to remain independent. We're following it all this year with our series on \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nEven if Trump wins the battle with Powell, he could still lose the war on rate cuts\n\nHeading into the year, investors expected two standard cuts from the central bank in 2026. Now JPMorgan is questioning if we'll even get one.\n\nStrong job and GDP growth, coupled with inflation sitting above 3%, has JPMorgan predicting the Fed will hold rates steady for the entire year. And that's even if Trump installs a Fed chair who's more keen to cut rates.\n\n\"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist.\n\nAs if things couldn't get worse, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has an even starker prediction: a rate hike.\n\nSløk said the massive amount of AI-led borrowing means companies issuing more bonds. The increase in investment-grade bonds could draw investors away from the Treasury market, potentially forcing rates higher.",

    "fullText": "The world's most senior central bankers are rallying around Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after he said the US government was attempting to pressure the central bank on monetary policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, a letter cosigned by the heads of 10 global central banking institutions defended Powell's integrity, calling him a \"respected colleague held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\n\"We stand in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell,\" the letter read.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve. It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "Greenland’s leaders and residents have hit back at President Donald Trump’s takeover talk, saying they are tired of being treated like a prize to be claimed.\n\nGreenlandic MP Per Berthelsen told the Financial Times: “They are treating us as if we were merchandise in a shop. I have difficulties seeing the difference between the way the Americans are acting towards Greenland, and Russia, where you can see that the interest is to make their [territory] bigger.”\n\n“We are not for sale. We don’t want to be Americans, we want to be Greenlanders,” Berthelsen, a former Greenlandic foreign minister, told the Financial Times.\n\n“I don’t want to live in an American empire,” resident Maja Overgaard said in the same report, while fisherman Helte Johannsen dismissed Trump outright: “I don’t think that Trump knows anything about Greenland.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his threats to take over Greenland after the U.S. kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in an unprecedented military move, and said it would run the country during a transition period.\n\nDuring a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Sunday, the president was asked whether he was still planning U.S. military action against Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“If we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will,” Trump said. “And I’m not letting that happen.”\n\nWhen asked if Greenland could “offer” him anything, he said, “Sure, I’d love to make a deal with them, that’s easier. But one way or the other, we’re gonna have Greenland.”\n\nTrump made a similar threat in a speech to Congress in March.\n\nOn Sunday, he clarified his approach: “Look, we’re talking about acquiring, not leasing, not having it short term. We’re talking about acquiring. And if we don’t do it, Russia or China will. And that’s not going to happen when I’m president.”\n\nHe repeated the threat Friday, telling reporters, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and added he would “do it the hard way” if a deal could not be reached.\n\nDenmark and Greenland have consistently rejected the idea, warning that U.S. military action could threaten NATO and emphasizing that Greenland is not for sale.\n\nLast week, Greenland’s government and opposition issued a joint statement: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, home to around 56,000 people mostly near Nuuk, is largely covered by ice but holds strategic and economic importance. Its location makes it vital to U.S. military early-warning systems, and melting ice has opened access to valuable resources, such as rare-earth minerals, drawing growing international interest.\n\n“It’s not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats—if you can call them that—from a giant like the US,” Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, told the BBC last week.\n\n“The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.”\n\nA 2025 Verian poll showed that only 6 percent of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9 percent undecided.",

At the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns.

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "description": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits",
    "fullText": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits different verdicts depending on who views it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have defended the agent and branded 37-year-old Renee Good a domestic terrorist. Local leaders and protesters across ​the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.\n\nSince the shooting last Wednesday, Reuters ‌has spoken to six Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 - part of a group of 20 whom Reuters has interviewed monthly since February - to better understand how they assess an incident caught on video that has been viewed by millions.\n\nEach of these half-dozen voters, ‌who vary in their assessments of Trump's immigration policy and overall performance, came away from the video with the same conclusion: The agent feared for his life and his decision to shoot Good was justifiable.\n\nTheir verdict mirrors that of the Trump administration. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters hours after the incident that Good had refused agents’ orders to move and then “proceeded to weaponize her vehicle.” Trump said on social media that the woman \"ran over the ICE Officer.\"\n\nMany Americans disagree. Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis this weekend to decry the killing and the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, called the Trump administration's assessment \"bullshit.\" Frey said the video showed an \"agent recklessly using power that resulted ⁠in somebody dying, getting killed.\"\n\nBut the video left all six voters convinced that ‌the agent shot Good because he thought she was trying to kill him. All expressed sympathy for the stressful conditions under which ICE and other law enforcement officers work, and many blamed Democratic leaders for inflaming anti-ICE sentiment, thereby making agents fear attacks from members of the public.\n\nAmanda Taylor, 52, an insurance firm employee near Savannah, Georgia, ‍who considers herself \"always pro-police,\" said the agent was \"protecting the community and protecting himself\" when he fired at Good.\n\nTaylor, who voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 and has had mixed feelings about Trump's economic policies and governing style, said the moment in the video when Good defied agents' orders to stop her car showed the agent she was a potential public threat.\n\n\"If they're running from you, what else are they gonna do?\" she said.\n\nThe first videos to widely circulate showed two ​masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at a perpendicular angle on a Minneapolis street. As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed ‌and then began driving forward, turning to the right.\n\nAnother officer, since identified as Jonathan Ross, was positioned in front of her car on the left. He drew his gun and fired three times, with the last shots aimed through the driver's side window. How much contact the car made with the officer, who stayed on his feet, has been widely debated.\n\nSeveral other voters also argued that Good's own actions led to her death. \"When I saw the video only one word came to mind, and that is 'disrespectful': another person failed to respect the law,\" said Herman Sims, 66, a night operations manager for a trucking company in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\"We won't ever know what would have happened if she kept going. Would she have run over someone else in the street blocks away?\" Sims said.\n\nChad Hill, 50, a supervisor at a nuclear power plant near his home in northwestern Ohio, ⁠also said the ICE agent was \"100% correct\" to use deadly force against Good once she had ignored officers' orders to ​stop.\n\n\"Putting a vehicle in drive and moving it toward a law enforcement officer is the same as drawing and pointing a gun,\" ​Hill said. He added that the \"political landscape in liberal cities has demonized ICE agents\" for merely doing their jobs.\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind it was self-defense,\" said Jon Webber, 45, a Walmart retail worker in Indiana who fully supports Trump's immigration crackdown. \"The moment she threw her car in [drive] and revved up, even if she was trying to ‍avoid the ICE agents, she came way too close.\"\n\nEven ⁠voters who had mixed feelings about the administration’s deportation drive felt the agent should not face legal consequences.\n\nDon Jernigan, 75, has previously told Reuters that some footage of ICE raids reminds him of Nazi Germany. But after viewing video of this incident, the Virginia Beach retiree said he thinks the ICE agent who shot Good should not be prosecuted, just retrained.\n\n\"When he was out of the way ⁠and she was beside him, yes, indeed, he shouldn't have shot at her,\" said Jernigan. \"But at that point, he didn't know. All he knew was somebody tried to kill him.\"\n\nAlthough Lou Nunez, 83, shares Jernigan's qualms about the aggressive tactics some ICE agents have ‌used during raids, he said he would not prosecute the one who shot Good. The Des Moines-based veteran said the officers \"work in a pressure-cooker situation\" and that the onus was on ‌Good to follow their orders.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.",

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Trump called for interest on credit cards to be capped for a year. UBS thinks that would end up hurting credit availability for some borrowers.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's idea to cap credit card interest could have far-reaching unintended consequences, UBS said on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was calling for a one-year, 10% rate cap for credit card interest, stating that the industry has been taking advantage of consumers.\n\nThe idea sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.\n\nWhile investors reacted to the latest threat to lenders' bottom line, UBS said that Trump's plan would have a negative impact on Main Street despite its intention to relieve high borrowing costs for many Americans.\n\nUBS analyst Erika Najarian said that the proposed credit card rate cap would likely backfire, as it would likely reduce consumer spending and curtail lending to certain borrower groups.\n\nNajarian said that credit card providers are more likely to dial back the availability of credit to certain borrowers, rather than simply offer cheaper credit.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that a 10% credit card rate cap would cut off credit availability to those that need it most: middle- and lower-income Americans,\" she added.\n\nThe team of analysts at UBS said that while they see a low likelihood of the plan becoming law, the overall impact on credit availability would be felt by both investors and consumers.\n\n\"According to the Boston Fed, the aggregate credit card spend by annual household income was as follows in May '25: 1) <$39k: ~$26bn; 2) $59-83k: ~$37bn; 3) >$121k: $175bn. Based on Boston Fed data, this means 26% of credit card spend, at least, would be at severe risk, implying a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP on average. Additionally, credit card spending accounts for nearly half of Visa's payment volume and more than half of Mastercard's. The kind of pullback predicted by UBS could severely compromise US economic growth.\n\nNajarian isn't the only finance pro to suggest that Trump's credit card rate cap plan could backfire. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman described it as a \"mistake\" and claimed that millions of credit cards could be cancelled as a result.",

Lower courts have found those tariffs to be illegal, and bettors on prediction market sites like Polymarket and Kalshi currently put the odds of a ruling against Trump at around 70%.\n\nIf that happens, the US may have to refund the billions of dollars in revenue that the government has collected from the IEEPA tariffs.\n\nTrump argued that the amount was worth \"Trillions of Dollars\" when accounting for investments that US companies have made to avoid tariffs.\n\n\"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about potential tariff refunds over the weekend, when he told Reuters that it \"won't be a problem if we have to do it.\"",

    "description": "The Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent from the president. The Justice Department investigation into Jerome Powell could change that.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump wants Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to do something Powell doesn't want to do.\n\nNow, Trump's federal prosecutors are now investigating Powell.\n\nThat's the shortest version of the news story that broke Sunday night, when Powell released an extraordinary statement and video, which I urge you to watch and read for yourself.\n\nKey quote from Powell, who Trump picked as Fed chair in 2017: \"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n(Trump told NBC on Sunday that he didn't have any knowledge of the investigation and that the DOJ wasn't trying to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. If you find that hard to believe, you might point to the fact that the investigation was reportedly authorized by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News anchor who is a longtime Trump ally.)\n\nAs Powell notes, using the threat of a criminal prosecution — fueled by a pretext — to pressure the Fed, which is meant to be independent of the White House but accountable to Congress, is unprecedented.\n\nBut the pattern most definitely has precedent in the Trump administration: Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen.\n\nIn this case, it's about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to lower rates. And more broadly, about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to answer to him.\n\nThat's why, prior to investigating Powell, he has also tried to remove Fed member Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee the Trump administration has accused of mortgage fraud. Cook fought Trump in court, and later this month the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case — and eventually rule on whether Trump can remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\n\nIt's easy to see many other examples of Trump trying the same thing. Trump, for instance, insisted that political enemies like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James should be prosecuted for … something. And when a Trump-appointed prosecutor declined to bring charges, Trump had him replaced with another appointee who would. Both of those cases have been dismissed by a federal judge, who said Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-installed US attorney who brought the cases, had been unlawfully appointed. The DOJ is appealing.\n\nOftentimes, the reactions to Trump's pressure campaigns amount to a shrug — Democrats complain, Republicans usually back him (or say nothing), and markets move around a bit before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nMaybe this time will be different: The Fed is supposed to be an institution that investors care about as a steady, guiding hand that doesn't swing wildly with political winds. Markets can ignore a lot of political ugliness; pressure on the Fed is harder to dismiss.\n\nThe broader pattern Powell is underlining goes well beyond monetary policy or even political score-settling. The administration has repeatedly paired aggressive action with a justification that is often strained at best. Prior to the raid that removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump and his proxies repeatedly insisted that Maduro and his country were killing countless Americans by bringing fentanyl into the US — which is not true. Last week, Kristi Noem, Trump's head of Homeland Security, said the shooting of a Minneapolis woman protesting an ICE raid was justified in part because she was a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\nSome of you will look at Trump's behavior and find something in there that you like, in an ends justify means formulation. Maduro was a terrible leader, so maybe you think that making up reasons to depose him doesn't matter much. Maybe you like Trump's deportation agenda, and aren't worried about him using masked agents with guns on city streets to make that happen.\n\nGive it time. We're still just a year into the second Trump administration, and his impulse to act without restraint has yet to find real pushback. \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me,\" he told The New York Times last week, when asked about the relevance of international laws and treaties. A president with an infinite target list and unchecked power is never finished.",

The White House did not provide additional information when reached by Business Insider.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, China and the United Arab Emirates are Iran's major trading partners.\n\nThe Trump administration has been trying to reach a trade deal with China after both countries backed down from a tariff war in 2025. According to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the trade volume between China and Iran reached $13.37 billion in 2024, with China exporting $8.93 billion worth of goods to Iran and importing around $4.44 billion from the country. More recent data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity shows that China exported $456 million and imported $208 million from Iran in October 2025.\n\nTrump's targeting of Iran comes as the country is experiencing mass protests against its government. Iran's crackdown on protesters has left hundreds dead and thousands arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.\n\nTrump has expressed support for the protesters and threatened the possibility of US involvement.\n\n\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"The USA stands ready to help!!!\"\n\nTrump's announcement also comes as the Supreme Court is expected to rule this week on the legality of the tariffs his administration has imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1970s-era law typically used by the President to impose sanctions.\n\nScott Bessent, Secretary of the Treasury, said in a petition to SCOTUS that the federal government could be on the hook to refund $1 trillion in tariffs to American businesses should the duties be ruled unconstitutional.\n\nTrump also wrote in a post on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.\n\nThe approximately 15-minute call came after Sheinbaum said Friday she had requested dialogue with the Trump administration at the end of a week in which he had said he was ready to confront drug cartels on the ground and repeated the accusation that cartels were running Mexico.\n\nTrump has repeatedly offered to send the U.S. military after the cartels and Sheinbaum has always declined, but after the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.\n\n“He (Trump) asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrump “still insisted that if we ask for it, they could help” with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. “We told him, so far it’s going very well, it’s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch.”\n\nSheinbaum said Monday the two leaders agreed to continue working together.\n\nMexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente spoke Sunday with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for “tangible results” and more cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico shared those results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and fentanyl overdose deaths.\n\nExperts still see U.S. intervention in Mexico as unlikely because Mexico is doing what the U.S. asks and is a critical economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to do more.\n\nSheinbaum said the two leaders did not speak about Cuba, which Trump threatened Sunday. Mexico is an important ally of the island nation, including selling it oil that it will need even more desperately now that the Trump administration says it will not allow any more oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba.",

    "description": "Stocks, bonds, and the dollar fell amid the DOJ's investigation into Powell. Credit card stocks plunged after Trump said interest should be capped.",
    "fullText": "The \"sell America\" trade is seeing a revival on Monday.\n\nInvestors were reacting to developments over the weekend, including a proposal to cap credit card interest rates and the Department of Justice's criminal investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nMajor indexes were down in early morning trading, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points as investors took in the news.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Monday:\n\nThe Justice Department's probe relates to the Fed Chair's testimony last year about the renovation of the Fed's office buildings, a project Trump has criticized for its cost.\n\nTrump, who said he has decided on his pick to replace Powell when the Fed Chair's term ends his May, said he had no knowledge of the probe when speaking to NBC Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe market has a complicated reaction to situations when it appears that Trump is applying pressure on Powell. The president has demanded that the Fed chief lower interest rates for years, including in his first term. The concern is that if rates are lowered prematurely, it could backfire and cause inflation to flare up again, which would force the central bank to turn hawkish and potentially hike rates down the road.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction among investors is something markets have seen before.\n\n\"All these moves suggest a possible return of the 'sell America' trade,\" Paul Hickey, the co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, wrote in a note on Monday, referring to the broad sell-off in US assets in 2025 as investors fretted over tariffs and the health of the economy.\n\n\"Investors rushed to cut their exposure to US assets,\" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, wrote in a note, pointing to concerns about the Fed's independence. \"Investors were also rattled by the Fed Chair's robust response,\" he added, referring to the video statement from Powell released on Sunday.\n\nHere were the moves investors saw Monday morning.\n\nTreasury yields were up as US debt securities faced selling pressure. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield climbed two basis points.\n\n\"Treasury yields are higher, and the curve is steeper amid fresh attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence,\" John Canavan, a lead analyst at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nInvestors have shed Treasurys in other times when the president has meddled with the Fed or threatened Powell. Yields spiked last April when Trump first said he could fire the Fed chair, with the president tempering his views following big bouts of selling in the Treasury market.\n\nGold, which acts as a hedge against inflation and a haven during bouts of geopolitical turmoil, soared to records, rising 2% and breaking through $4,600 for the first time on Monday.\n\nThe precious metal is up 4% from levels at the start of the year and just recorded its best-ever annual run since 1979, around the time inflation began to soar in the US.\n\nDemand for safe havens looks \"strong,\" particularly as investors continue to weigh tensions between the US and other countries, like Venezuela and Greenland, Trade Nation's Morrison said.\n\nOther metals that typically rally alongside gold, like silver and copper, were also up.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, declined 0.4% on Monday, a possible sign that investors are reducing their exposure to dollar assets due to concerns about the Fed's independence.\n\n\"The investigation into Mr Powell has raised concerns about the Fed's autonomy, an unfavourable backdrop for the greenback,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The broader fear is that the move could continue to erode Fed autonomy, which may raise long-term inflation expectations and be bearish for the greenback,\" Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, the chief economist at Ebury, wrote in a note.\n\nThe financial sector was rocked after Trump proposed that credit card interest rates be capped at 10% for a one-year period in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration. AFFORDABILITY!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform.\n\n\"Trump's proposal to cap credit card rates at 10% for a year added another layer of uncertainty, particularly for banks,\" Morrison added.",

    "description": "Meta named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman. She previously advised President Donald Trump and worked at Goldman Sachs.",
    "fullText": "Meta has a new president — and she's a former advisor to President Donald Trump.\n\nThe tech giant named Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman on Monday. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April before resigning in December.\n\nBefore joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as a deputy national security advisor to Trump. The president applauded her appointment on Truth Social: \"A great choice by Mark Z!!\"\n\nPowell McCormick is the second former Trump official appointed to a Meta leadership position in 2026. Last week, the company hired C.J. Mahoney, a deputy US trade representative during Trump's first term, as its chief legal officer.\n\nHere are three things to know about Dina Powell McCormick:\n\nPowell McCormick worked as a Trump advisor during his first term, with a focus on the Middle East.\n\nShe had a personal tie to the region. Powell McCormick was born in Cairo, where her father was a captain in the Egyptian army. In 1977, her family moved to Dallas.\n\nDuring her stint with the Trump administration, Powell McCormick oversaw a $200 billion US-Saudi arms deal, spearheaded Trump's Middle East tour, and was considered to take over as Trump's chief of staff or representative to the United Nations.\n\nShe left the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nPowell McCormick also served under President George W. Bush. She started in a personnel role, before rising to senior White House assistant and assistant secretary of state under Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAt the time of her resignation in 2007, Powell McCormick was the highest-ranking Arab American in the Bush administration.\n\nAfter leaving the Bush administration, Powell McCormick went to Goldman Sachs, where she was hired as a managing director.\n\nPowell McCormick shot up in stature, making partner in three years. Her rapid rise sparked some bitterness among Goldman's underclass, according to The New York Times and Vanity Fair.\n\nUnder her leadership, Goldman launched its 10,000 Women program. She also oversaw the 10,000 Small Businesses program and served as the president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nPowell McCormick was popular among some of Goldman's biggest names, including Anne Black, the former president of Goldman Sachs Gives and current managing partner at JP Morgan.\n\n\"She was really a steadfast champion for me and others of us on the team, who were all promoted thanks to her,\" Black told Vanity Fair. \"She elevated my game, inspired me to be creative and bold, and expected us to show results.\"\n\nPowell McCormick left Goldman Sachs in 2023.\n\nWhile Powell McCormick no longer works in politics, she's still involved through her husband: Pennsylvania senator Dave McCormick.\n\nThe couple wed in 2019. Soon after, Dave began eyeing a Senate run, and Dina became involved in the campaign. She made trips to Mar-a-Lago with her husband and appeared in several ads.\n\nDave ended up conceding the Republican nomination to Mehmet Oz — also known as television's Dr. Oz — in the 2022 race. Oz lost the general election to John Fetterman and was later appointed by Trump to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nIn 2024, Dave ran again, narrowly winning a Senate seat and beating incumbent Bob Casey. Dina accompanied him to his swearing-in.",

    "description": "Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen said the probe into Jerome Powell is akin to how \"emerging markets\" set financial policy.",
    "fullText": "All three living former chairs of the Federal Reserve rushed to Jerome Powell's defense after the current Fed chair said he is under criminal investigation.\n\nThe former chairs, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Janet Yellen, led the central bank under presidents of both major political parties, dating back to Greenspan's first appointment by President Reagan in 1987.\n\nThe statement is also signed by five former Treasury secretaries, including former Secretary Hank Paulson, who was President George W. Bush's final full-time leader of the department. Three other Treasury secretaries, Yellen, Jack Lew, and Timothy F. Geithner, served under President Obama. Former Treasury Secretary Richard Rubin served under President Clinton.\n\nThe entire statement is included below:\n\nOn Sunday night, Powell said that the Federal Reserve had received grand jury subpoenas related to his testimony before the Senate in the summer. A subpoena is not an indictment, but it does demonstrate the extent to which the Justice Department is willing to pursue the case.\n\nFor months, Trump and the White House have argued that Powell misled Congress in his discussion of the renovations to the Federal Reserve building. In July, Powell led Trump and reporters on a tour of the $2.5 billion renovation, although the episode did not end the tensions between the pair.\n\nIn his statement, Powell said that the criminal investigation was \"not about Congress's oversight role\" but rather retaliation for the Fed's repeated decisions to hold interest rates steady before voting to lower rates in September.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell (a power that no president may have over the central bank chair) and has engaged in a very public search for Powell's replacement. Powell's term runs through May.",
