    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "title": "Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump",
    "description": "The DOJ removed already-public Epstein files in defiance of a disclosure statute, prompting bipartisan outrage and impeachment talk from the law’s authors.",
    "fullText": "(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Justice Department is now engaged in an open cover-up carried out in direct violation of federal law.\n\nOver the weekend, the department quietly removed 16 photographs from the Epstein files website it created to comply with a disclosure statute passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. The removals came without notice or explanation. Among the deleted images was one of the few photographs that even indirectly featured Trump, a picture of a credenza drawer inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan home containing other photographs, including at least one of Trump. Twelve others depicted Epstein’s third-floor massage room, a central crime scene in the federal investigation. Some images of the same room remain public. Others disappeared.\n\nWhen Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked whether the Trump-related image had been taken down, the Justice Department declined to respond.\n\nWhat followed made matters worse.\n\nIn a post on X quoting Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department claimed that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Blanche’s original post asserted that the department had released Epstein materials “under the Epstein Files Transparency Act” and that additional disclosures would follow “as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”\n\nThat explanation fails under the statute the department invoked.\n\nCongress did not authorize a rolling review. The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related materials in its possession. The law imposes a mandatory disclosure obligation and permits only limited redactions to protect victims. It grants no authority to retract, revise, or curate records after release. Once the department published those materials, the law required that they remain available to the public.\n\nRemoving them placed the department in direct conflict with the statute Congress enacted.\n\nThat conflict was immediately recognized. Blanche’s post received a community note stating that the law requires the release of all files and allows only narrow redactions to protect victims, adding that the department’s partial release and extensive redactions violated the statute. The Justice Department’s own post received a community note citing the statute directly and stating that retractions and redactions to protect politically exposed persons are not permitted. Community Notes appear only when users with differing political viewpoints agree on their accuracy, underscoring how broadly that conclusion was shared.\n\nThe department’s own explanation confirms it is violating the law it claims to follow.\n\nThe sequence exposes motive. The files went live. Political reaction followed. The department then altered the public record. Compliance held only until presidential exposure appeared, then gave way to erasure.\n\nIn November, I described the Trump Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein files as a cover-up. Last week, I wrote that the administration’s delay in disclosure created a political problem rather than an immediate legal one. That assessment reflected weak enforcement mechanisms and an approach built on delay rather than open defiance.\n\nRemoving already released material that implicates the president converts a credibility crisis into a statutory violation and a far larger political emergency. Congress passed the Epstein disclosure statute precisely to eliminate executive discretion. Lawmakers acted because the Justice Department repeatedly demonstrated it could not be trusted to manage politically sensitive material involving powerful figures. The law mandated disclosure to prevent executive self-protection.\n\nThe department seized that discretion anyway.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had lawful options. She could have sought judicial review. She could have consulted Congress. She could have acknowledged that the statute permits no removal authority and sought amendment. Each path would have preserved institutional legitimacy. She chose concealment and false justification instead.\n\nThis erasure differs from earlier Trump-era document fights in a crucial way. Prior disputes centered on whether materials must be disclosed. This episode involves evidence already released to the public under statutory standards. The department determined the images satisfied the law’s requirements, then removed them once the political cost became apparent.\n\nEvery disclosure statute now faces the same test: compliance survives only until it threatens the president. Months of delay, sweeping redactions, and staged releases already convinced much of the public that the Justice Department prioritized Trump’s standing over transparency, victims, and the public interest. The image removals confirm that conclusion decisively.\n\nA Justice Department that edits evidence to shield the president forfeits legitimacy. Oversight collapses when obedience ends at political inconvenience. The rule of law depends on statutes binding the executive even when compliance proves costly.\n\nCongress wrote a law to prevent exactly this abuse. The president signed it. The attorney general is now violating it to protect him. That meets any reasonable standard for impeachment.\n\nThe backlash on Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who forced the House vote compelling disclosure, both said the Justice Department failed to comply with the law. Khanna has confirmed that he and Massie are drafting impeachment and contempt measures against Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nCongress now faces a choice. It can accept that disclosure laws apply only when politically painless. It can normalize the disappearance of already public evidence. It can allow executive power to override legislative command.\n\nOr it can enforce the law it wrote.\n\nThis is a cover-up enforced through executive defiance. The question now is whether Congress will enforce its own laws.\n\nThe post Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — When Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest convention reached its halfway point, Erika Kirk tried to put a smiling face on things.\n\n“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk, who has led the influential conservative organization since her husband Charlie was assassinated in September. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”\n\nSome of the biggest names in conservative media took turns torching each other on the main stage, spending more time targeting right-wing rivals than their left-wing opponents.\n\nThe feuds could ultimately define the boundaries of the Republican Party and determine the future of President Donald Trump's fractious coalition, which appears primed for more schisms in the months and years ahead.\n\nHere are some of the most notable moments from the four-day conference.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, set the tone with the first speech after Erika Kirk opened the convention. He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

    "description": "From tariff rebate checks, to bonuses, to Trump accounts, to DOGE dividends, here's all the free money Trump has floated giving to Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump really wants to send you a check.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has pledged to send Americans money in various ways, including tariff rebate checks and bonuses to select government employees.\n\nSome of that free money is becoming a reality: Congress created \"Trump Accounts\" as part of the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which will provide tax-free federal grants of $1,000 to children born in the next few years.\n\nOthers remain elusive, or have fallen by the wayside. Remember the DOGE dividend?\n\nTrump also sent out checks during his first term, but under much different circumstances. As part of two successive COVID-era stimulus bills, the federal government sent Americans $1,200 in the spring of 2020 and $600 in the winter, shortly before the president left office.\n\nTrump's signature appeared on those checks, which was a source of controversy during a presidential election year.\n\nIn February, investor James Fishback floated the idea of sending $5,000 \"DOGE Dividend\" checks to almost 80 million taxpaying American households.\n\nThose checks would be paid for by spending cuts achieved by DOGE, the government efficiency office led by Elon Musk at the time.\n\nThe idea quickly caught Musk's attention, and Trump eventually said that they were under consideration.\n\nBut there were some problems. For one, the $5,000 figure was based on Musk's original estimate of $2 trillion in savings, which never materialized.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also balked at the idea, saying they preferred to see a reduction in the national debt.\n\nThe idea eventually faded, though Trump's political operation has continued to float the idea in fundraising emails.\n\nWhile defending tariffs in a November Truth Social post, Trump said his administration would pay \"everyone\" except \"high income people\" a dividend of at least $2,000.\n\nAlthough Trump's Truth Social posts are not actual government orders, the statement drew attention from citizens and his colleagues in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published an analysis the following day, stating that there would not be enough tariff revenue to support the idea.\n\n\"With our national debt quickly approaching an all-time high and annual budget deficits approaching $2 trillion per year, it is imperative that policymakers focus on actually reducing deficits and putting debt on a downward path,\" the committee wrote.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent also pushed back on Trump's dividend remark during an ABC News interview, saying there were no plans to spend tariff revenue.\n\nTrump would also need approval from Congress to pass such an order, which seems unlikely given the lack of enthusiasm from Republican members.\n\n\"We're facing a deficit this year around $2 trillion,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters. \"I think whatever revenue we get, from whatever source, ought to go to try and bring down those deficits.\"\n\nThe longest government shutdown in US history began on October 1, spanning 43 days while Democrats and Republicans in Congress negotiated a new budget.\n\nThe fallout forced the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others — such as air traffic controllers — had to continue working without pay ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday rush.\n\nAir traffic controllers received their first $0 paychecks in late October. Some of them stopped showing up for work, sparking a staffing shortage and an onslaught of flight delays and cancellations.\n\n\"They're confronted with a decision: Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions,\" Duffys said. \"I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, criticized the air traffic controllers who had not shown up for work during the shutdown in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe said air traffic controllers who didn't take time off during the shutdown were \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for each of them.\n\nDuffy shared more details in an X post, writing that 776 air traffic controllers would receive $10,000 bonus checks in early December.\n\n\"Santa's coming to town a little early,\" Duffy wrote.\n\nTrump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" into law on July 4, implementing new tax policies and changes to federal programs, including SNAP.\n\nThe bill also introduced so-called Trump Accounts, which are specialized retirement accounts for US children. They were previously referred to as \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or MAGA accounts.\n\nThe Trump administration said children born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, who open Trump Accounts, would receive a one-time $1,000 tax-free federal grant. US children with a valid Social Security number are eligible. Friends, family, and others are allowed to deposit another $5,000 tax-free into those accounts.\n\nThe White House said several CEOs agreed to invest in Trump Accounts, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell pledged to invest $6.25 billion to support Invest America, the federal program that spearheaded Trump Accounts.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio has also pledged to deposit $250 into the Trump Accounts of 300,000 Connecticut children. Some large companies, like BlackRock, have offered a $1,000 match for the children of eligible employees.\n\nDuring an economic address to Americans in December, Trump said his administration would provide bonus checks to members of the military before Christmas.\n\nIn a subsequent news release, the newly rebranded Department of War said Trump is giving service members bonus checks to \"thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the US military has been defending the nation.\"\n\nThe checks, dubbed the \"Warrior Dividend,\" are each worth $1,776.\n\n\"Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill. Approximately 1.28 million active-duty and 174,000 reserve component military members will receive the dividend as a nontaxable supplement to their regular monthly housing allowance,\" the Department of War said.\n\nThe department said eligible service members can expect to see the payment before December 20.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "description": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ.",
    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

He first brings up Trump by mentioning the strikes on the alleged Venezuelan drug boats.\n\n“There’s little evidence to support their actions,” he says in the video. “And pretending its all the fake drugs but really it’s a way to claiming a war against Venezuela so we can steal their oil.”\n\nHe also says the evidence of that is the full pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who helped funnel cocaine into the United States.\n\n“If you’re fighting drugs, I don’t know if you should be forgiving the guy who brought 10 flat beds of cocaine into the country,” Matthews said.\n\nMatthews also brings up Hilary Clinton, Israel’s actions against Gaza and Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\n\n“The attacks on immigrants and different populations seems pretty racist,” he said.\n\nHis final remark is on how Trump reacted after the murders of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner.\n\n“What a disgusting human being Donald Trump is. What a shallow, horrifying selfish, greedy, cruel little pig he is,” Matthew said.\n\nMatthews rock band, Dave Matthews Band was formed in 1991 and is expecting to have four performances in Cancun in January.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Several key Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Josh Hawley, have been outspoken against federal AI preemption.",
    "fullText": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

    "title": "Trump Announces Pricing Deals with Nine Drugmakers",
    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

    "description": "The Kennedy Center added Donald Trump's name to its facade on Friday. Here's a look back at how it came to be and how it has changed under Trump.",
    "fullText": "With his White House renovations already underway, President Donald Trump is now leaving his mark on the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe day after the Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted to change the name, new signage appeared on the building's facade on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nOriginally established by Congress in 1958 as an \"artistic mecca\" for the performing arts in the nation's capital, the National Cultural Center was officially renamed in memory of President John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963. Since its opening in 1971, the center has hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as a range of events and exhibits across genres.\n\nSince the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, changing its name requires congressional approval. That hasn't stopped the Center's Trump-appointed board from implementing the change on the building as well as its website. Whether the name sticks remains to be seen.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the Center came to be and its changes under Trump's leadership so far.\n\nOriginally named the National Cultural Center, the act authorized the construction of the building and established it as an independent institution with a mission to host arts and culture events, as well as educational programming.\n\nKennedy Onassis and Mamie Eisenhower served as honorary co-chairwomen of the project.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act in January 1964 to change the name and provide $23 million in federal funds for its construction.\n\nAfter signing the bill, Johnson handed the pen to Edward Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's brother.\n\n\"As this center comes to reflect and advance the greatness of America, consider then those glories were purchased by a valiant leader who never swerved from duty — John Kennedy. And in his name I dedicate this site,\" Johnson said at the groundbreaking ceremony, held in December 1964.\n\nDesigned by architect Edward Durell Stone, the Kennedy Center was built on the banks of the Potomac River using 3,700 tons of marble gifted to the US from Italy.\n\nFor its opening event, the Kennedy Center hosted a performance of \"Mass\" by Leonard Bernstein, which was commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe first Kennedy Center honorees included Fred Astaire, Marian Anderson, George Balanchine, Arthur Rubinstein, and Richard Rodgers.\n\nBeyoncé brought the Kennedy Center to its feet with a fiery tribute to Tina Turner in 2005, and President Barack Obama shed tears while watching Aretha Franklin perform \"Natural Woman\" to honor Carole King in 2015.\n\nTrump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, but has taken a much more active role in shaping the institution in his second non-consecutive term.\n\nAfter taking office earlier this year, he fired the president and Biden-appointed members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, replacing them with allies and members of his administration. The board went on to elect Trump as its chairman.\n\nWhile visiting the performance venue in March, Trump told board members that the building was in \"bad shape\" and said he planned to renovate the space.\n\n\"We're going to make a lot of changes, including the seats, the décor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nAt the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 7, honorees received newly designed medallions from Tiffany, featuring blue ribbons instead of the traditional rainbow colors.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that the board had \"unanimously\" voted to change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center, and the website was updated to reflect the change.\n\nTrump's name was added to the building's signage on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"honored,\" while Democratic lawmakers and members of the Kennedy family criticized the president.\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, contested the White House's claim of a unanimous vote, writing on X that \"microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,\" while Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, wrote on X that the change is not acceptable.\n\nSix Democratic lawmakers said in a statement that Trump was \"attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for New York governor and will not seek reelection to Congress, abruptly bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Bruce Blakeman, a county official in New York City’s suburbs. But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court sided with immigration judges on Friday, rebuffing the Trump administration for now in a case with possible implications for federal workers as the justices weigh expanding presidential firing power.\n\nThe decision is a technical step in a long-running case, but it touches on the effects of a series of high-profile firings under President Donald Trump. The justices let stand a ruling that raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of the federal workforce, though they also signaled that lower courts should move cautiously.\n\nImmigration judges are federal employees, and the question at the center of the appeal is about whether they can sue to challenge a policy restricting their public speeches or if they are required to use a separate complaint system for the federal workforce.\n\nTrump's Republican administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene after an appeals court found that Trump’s firings of top complaint system officials had raised questions about whether it's still working as intended.\n\nThe Justice Department said the firings are within the president’s power and the lower court had no grounds to raise questions. The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to quickly freeze the ruling as he pushes to have the immigration judges’ case removed from federal court.\n\nThe justices declined, though they also said the Trump administration could return if the lower courts moved too fast. There were no noted dissents. The court has allowed most of Trump’s firings for now and is weighing whether to formally expand his legal power to fire independent agency officials by overturning job protections enshrined in a 90-year-old decision.\n\nA union formerly representing immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department, first sued in 2020 to challenge a policy restricting what the judges can speak about in public. They say the case is a free-speech issue that belongs in federal court.\n\nRamya Krishnan, an attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who argued the case on the union's behalf, applauded the high court's Friday decision. “The restrictions on immigration judges’ free speech rights are unconstitutional, and it’s intolerable that this prior restraint is still in place,” Krishnan said.\n\nIn recent months, the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has included firing dozens of immigration judges who are seen by his allies as too lenient.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment Friday.\n\nWhile the order is not a final decision, the case could eventually have implications for other federal workers who want to challenge firings in court rather than the employee complaint system now largely overseen by Trump appointees.\n\nThe decision comes after a series of wins for the Justice Department on the high court’s emergency docket. The court has sided with the Trump administration about two dozen times on issues ranging from immigration to federal funding.\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorneys for President Donald Trump urged a federal judge on Friday to rule that Trump is entitled to presidential immunity from civil claims that he instigated a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta didn't rule from the bench after hearing arguments from Trump attorneys and lawyers for Democratic members of Congress who sued the Republican president and allies over the Jan. 6. 2021, attack.\n\nTrump spoke to a crowd of his supporters at the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House before the mob’s attack disrupted the joint session of Congress for certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.\n\nTrump's attorneys argue that his conduct leading up to Jan. 6 and on the day of the riot is protected by presidential immunity because he was acting in his official capacity.\n\n“The entire point of immunity is to give the president clarity to speak in the moment as the commander-in-chief,” Trump attorney Joshua Halpern told the judge.\n\nThe lawmakers' lawyers argue Trump can't prove he was acting entirely in his official capacity rather than as an office-seeking private individual. And office-seekers aren't entitled to presidential immunity, they contend.\n\n“President Trump has the burden of proof here,” said plaintiffs' attorney Joseph Sellers. “We submit that he hasn't come anywhere close to satisfying that burden.”\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee, sued Trump, his personal attorney Rudolph Giuliani and members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers extremist groups over the Jan. 6 riot. Other Democratic members of Congress later joined the litigation.\n\nThe civil claims survived Trump's sweeping act of clemency on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned, commuted prison sentences and ordered the dismissal of all 1,500-plus criminal cases stemming from the Capitol siege.",

    "description": "I spent a month in her head. I was surprised by what I found.",
    "fullText": "When I started to listen to the much-hyped new podcast from Katie Miller, I’d hoped to learn something, anything, to justify the many irreplaceable hours of my life I had already committed to it. I wanted a salacious tidbit or quote from one of the nearly 20 episodes that have dropped since August. I wanted moments that might help me understand the kind of person who would be married to Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of many of the Trump administration’s harshest and darkest policies.\n\nI did not get any of these things. The podcast, I’m afraid, is eye-wateringly boring—void of a single revelatory moment. House Speaker Mike Johnson is asked why he recently changed his style of glasses. Vice President J.D. Vance is asked to settle a debate as to whether a hot dog can be considered a sandwich. “Secretary of War” Pete Hegseth, appearing alongside his wife, is asked whether he prefers drumsticks, flats, or boneless wings. Sen. Katie Britt is asked how she passes time on airplanes. (Spoiler: she works.) And on it goes with Elon Musk, with “MAHA” influencer Vani Hari aka “Food Babe,” with actress Cheryl Hines, who is married to RFK Jr., and even with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Miller has access to a who’s who of high-profile MAGA figures, and she uses that time to ask them the most banal questions imaginable.\n\nSo that’s it? Skip the podcast and close this tab? Not so fast.\n\nYes, the podcast is dull in the extreme, and it seems to hinge in part on a bizarre assumption that the public is desperate for an inside glimpse of these people’s lives, in the vein of “Stars: They’re just like us.” But there’s something fascinating about it too: a bigger project with massive political and cultural ambitions, and one that we can’t afford to ignore. And the key to understanding that project is understanding Miller herself—where she came from and where she wants to go. In between listening to episodes of the show, I was talking to people who knew Miller growing up in Florida, and that’s when it all started to make more sense.\n\nAt a time when the military is bombing Venezuelan boats, National Guard troops are patrolling the streets of Washington, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are snatching parents off the streets in front of their children, Miller’s podcast—and her persona—is aimed at adding a patina of softness over a hard-right policy agenda. Surely the administration could not be as extreme or evil or fascist as its critics say if its members are chatting casually about raising their own children and picking new eyewear. The obvious audience for the podcast is white women, considered a swing demographic. (They favored Donald Trump by 4 points in 2024, according to Pew research, while white men went for Trump over Kamala Harris by a full 20 points. The divide is even larger among young women: Miller shared a graphic on her X account showing the widening partisan gulf between young men and women. “We aren’t talking to conservative women,” she wrote.)\n\nSo Miller announced her podcast in a video shared to X in August. In the video, Miller sits cross-legged in a gray armchair, wearing jeans and a white tank top, surrounded by soft lamps and plants, a copy of The Great Gatsby peeking out from a bookshelf behind her. “As a mom of three kids, who eats healthy, goes to the gym, works full time, I know there isn’t a podcast for women like myself,” Miller tells the camera. Bringing white women closer in line to their male counterparts would sharply reorient our politics and, if durable, could lead to something that looks like a permanent MAGA majority.\n\nOn some level, Miller is a strange choice for America’s trad-wife in chief. She married Stephen in 2020 at the Trump International Hotel, with the president himself in attendance. She too was a political player: She fell in love with Stephen over family-separation policies while she was working as a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security. (During her tenure at DHS, officials sent her to the southern border in the hopes that what she saw there might make her a little more compassionate. By her own telling, speaking to journalist Jacob Soboroff, “it didn’t work.”) Following her stint at DHS, she joined Vice President Mike Pence’s office as a spokesperson, later making it clear where her loyalties lay amid the bitter fallout between Pence and Trump over the Capitol riot. Earlier this year, she worked for DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, under Musk.\n\nAnd so Miller’s new position—in which she emphasizes her role as a wife and mother to three young children—has entailed a bit of a rebrand, shedding the image of a government attack dog in favor of a softer archetype. “When society told women that our value was derived from our ability to make an income instead of derived from the joy of motherhood we all failed,” Miller wrote online in October. “Make babies. Raise those babies. It’s our highest and best value.”\n\nWhen I started talking to people who knew Miller before she was a retrofitted, would-be MAGA icon—before she ever met Donald Trump—they described a person with some altogether different ambitions. Through their eyes, the entire public project of the Millers takes on added dimensions. And it all helps explain why, if you look closely, it’s clear something has gone awry with the fantasy Katie Miller is trying to sell.\n\nBefore she was the bride of Stephen Miller, Katie Miller was 15-year-old Katie Waldman, attending the first debate class for the 10th grade of Cypress Bay High School, in Broward County, Florida. During the class, which was held in a portable trailer due to overcrowding, students were tasked with a graded assignment to give a short speech about themselves.\n\nMiller’s address was particularly memorable: “She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’ ” one former classmate told me. “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud.”\n\nMiller was raised in Weston, a suburban fever dream spread across 10,500 acres of what, before being drained for development, was once Everglades wetland. Weston was built by Arvida, the same company that designed Disney World and Celebration, the Disney-owned planned community. It’s meticulously organized perfection: Its various neighborhoods, gated communities, parks, and street are pristine and feature shallow lagoons and golf courses, palm trees and hibiscus, blue skies and backyard swimming pools. One comparison kept coming up when I interviewed people for this story: It was like The Stepford Wives, a place where rich dads go to work and hot moms pick up the kids in nice cars.\n\nWeston was developed all at once in the 1990s and quickly cemented a reputation as a haven for “white flight,” only instead of white people fleeing Black people in inner cities, they were escaping the influx of immigration from Latino and Caribbean countries into Miami. In an interview with the Washington Post in 1998, Weston’s developers described the new suburb as “Our Home Town.” “It’s more like America,” one of them said.\n\nGlenn J. Waldman and his wife, Sheryl, left their 2,000-square-foot home in northern Miami in 1994, after their daughter Katie was born, and bought a property in the neighborhood of Weston Hills, one of the most prestigious gated communities in Weston, where homes are painted in mandatory hues such as Champagne Dance and Grandma’s Linen. The Waldmans, who are Jewish, had three children in total, and Katie was the middle. Glenn Waldman was a longtime donor to Republican lawmakers, bucking the overwhelming liberal slant in Weston, which is currently represented in Congress by Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nAs for Miller, former classmates remember her as having broadly conservative politics, but they say she was fairly liberal on social issues. Ryan Terrell was the captain of the debate team at Cypress Bay High School and coached her in debate for a semester. Terrell was one of the few openly gay kids at Cypress Bay. “When she got married to Stephen Miller and got more involved in conservative circles, I thought it was interesting, because we had this whole social culture-war issue and I never saw Katie advocating for banning it,” Terrell said. “We had political discussions back then, and she never seemed to be homophobic or having issues with the LGBTQ community.”\n\nMiller was popular in the sense that she was part of a clique and had social status, but her former classmates said that popularity shouldn’t be confused with being well liked. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.” Former classmates remember her as wearing Juicy Couture tracksuits over a white top, poker-straight hair tied up in a ponytail. “She was very Valley Girl–ish,” Terrell said, “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighborhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”\n\nShe worked as a photo editor for the award-winning student newspaper the Circuit, which was featured in an MTV reality show, The Paper. She left there with plenty of critics: “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” said Emmi Weiner, who was an entertainment editor at the Circuit.\n\nMiller was apparently happy to court controversy even as a teen. A 2020 feature in Vanity Fair about the Millers’ engagement resurfaced an incident involving Katie and a widely respected English teacher, Simone Waite—one of the school’s few Black faculty members. Waite had been teaching Toni Morrison’s Beloved, which provoked discussions about slavery. When Waite said that one of the many sins of slavery was that it erased Black people of their history, Miller objected. “Couldn’t they just tell each other about their history?” she asked, according to the Vanity Fair report. She wouldn’t let it go and, after Waite suggested they “agree to disagree,” left the class and drafted a petition accusing Waite of psychological damage, calling the teacher “sickening.” The issue was eventually resolved following a meeting involving Miller, her father, and Waite—during which they agreed to take Miller out of the class.\n\nThe world that shaped Miller’s early years was one of suburban perfection and sheltered artifice, a nostalgic ideal so far removed from reality that it shares a developer with Disney World. In many ways, it’s a fantasy that’s not far from the promises of MAGA.\n\nAug. 11, 2025, was a difficult day to soften the Trump administration’s rough edges. It was the same day that the president announced a de facto takeover of law enforcement in the District of Columbia, complete with National Guard troops in the streets and armored vehicles parked in front of Union Station. Although executed under the auspices of fighting “rising crime,” despite violent crime rates having decreased in D.C. since 2023, the maneuver also functioned as a declaration of MAGA dominance over a blue city.\n\nAug. 11 was also the airdate of Miller’s podcast’s first episode, featuring none other than Vice President J.D. Vance. The lighting in the video version was soft, and the topic was domestic bliss. Vance, an unapologetic apostle of Trump’s far-right agenda, spent much of the 45-minute interview playing a jolly sitcom dad who impersonates an “ogre” at Disneyland, makes cheesecake on weekends, and insists upon the whole family gathering for dinner at the dining table each night. Other topics mentioned included Vance’s fandom of Magic: The Gathering, his opinions on cargo shorts, his “dad icks,” his preferred memes, and his “secret to keeping his marriage solid.” (He and Usha read the same book and discuss it.)\n\nThe interview is utterly anodyne, a doddering exchange of pleasantries and carefully selected humanizing anecdotes. If you were to watch it in a vacuum, you’d have no sense of a country in a time of mass transformation. There’s no probing of Vance’s real views on domestic life, including his position that well-educated women who prioritize careers over starting families are choosing a “path to misery.”\n\nMiller likes to conclude her interviews by asking her subject which three people, living or dead, they’d invite to dinner. Vance’s answer: Isaac Newton, Abraham Lincoln, and Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Weston, Miller went to the University of Florida, her father’s alma mater, and pledged to the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She joined the ruling party of Florida’s student government, which presided over some 60,000 students, in an initial foray into politics that was, to say the least, eventful.\n\nBack then, Florida’s student government had a reputation of operating a little like an autocracy. The governing party—which has changed its name over the years but was known as the Unite Party at the time Miller joined—was ruled by the iron fists of privileged frat boys and sorority girls, who controlled the school’s spending and were tapped for access to the exclusive Florida Blue Key society. After graduation, they were funneled into elected office and law clerkships.\n\nMiller, typically seen on campus in the sorority girl’s uniform of Nike shorts and a sorority-branded raincoat, quickly established herself as a power player in this world and operated like a “henchman” for the ruling party, said one former student. Members of opposing parties in student government typically were collegial with one another, socializing together despite disagreements. Not Miller.\n\n“Katie’s a very tenacious, self-assured individual,” recalled Jordan Ball, who was a senator for the opposition party. “She looked down on people she didn’t agree with.” Another former member of the student government described Miller’s approach to politics as “tribal.” “Most people in student government would be cordial and nice and would try to work together,” they said. “I feel like it was Katie’s whole life. She took it all very personally.”\n\nMultiple people I spoke to said that the Unite Party, which was overwhelmingly white, had a pattern of punishing Black and Hispanic affinity groups financially if they didn’t rally behind them during campaigns. “It was an open secret, but it still seemed strange on the outside, like, Why are these groups kowtowing to sororities and frats which were mostly white?” recalled one former member of student government. “Those groups would end up endorsing a bunch of frat bros.” (In 2016 those claims were among the many grievances that drove the student-led #NotMySystem movement, which called out the elitist and even corrupt practices of majority student government.)\n\nIn 2012, her sophomore year, while serving on the rules and ethics committee of student government, Miller was embroiled in a scandal. The head football coach had endorsed a candidate from the opposition Students Party, and the Independent Florida Alligator, the college paper, ran a front-page story publicizing it. Two people—later revealed to be Miller and former Student Government President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier—were spotted dumping 268 copies of the newspaper on the eve of student elections.\n\n“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, who was a senator for the opposition party. Some people who knew her told me that they were a little scared of her back then, pointing to what they saw as a vindictive streak. Despite this reputation, Miller continued to rise through the ranks of the Unite Party, acquiring more and more power and responsibility, including being appointed to chair the allocations committee.\n\nHer ascent after all this was the subject of numerous editorials in the Independent Florida Alligator, including one with the headline “Katie Waldman Should Resign.” “Sen. Katie Waldman’s appointment to the position of allocations chairwoman is an affront to the students of UF,” wrote Max Stein, who was part of the opposition party. “I do not question her qualifications, passion or work ethic. I question her ethical and moral fiber.”\n\nThe paper’s editorial board didn’t pull any punches either. “With the recommendation that Waldman head a committee, bad behavior is being rewarded and the corruption continues to seep deeper into the fabric” of student government, the board wrote.\n\nThe Unite Party went on the attack against the student newspaper. “They have thrown away journalist integrity,” candidate TJ Villamil said in a video posted to YouTube. “Misrepresenting facts, inaccurate quotes, and completely falsified stories are just some of the few ways they’ve attempted to skew my message to the voters.”\n\nAfter a tenure in the senate that was defined by scandal, Miller was not invited by party leadership to run for her seat again. Departing senators are typically invited to get up and give goodbye speeches, and Miller’s was, by all accounts, memorable. She was bitter about not being asked to run again and felt betrayed. She delivered a glowering, chaotic speech that was full of tacit threats. “The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding party leadership’s decision to ultimately remove her from power in 2013 remain a mystery and were subject to much speculation and gossip, particularly as those leaders were seen as her closest friends. But Miller’s fiery speech also got people talking: “It left a very big impression,” Dwyer said. “I think she felt like a victim.”\n\nNarratives of victimhood, disenfranchisement, and persecution have been foundational to the collective identity of the MAGA movement. Trump has regularly cast himself as the ultimate martyr, routinely claiming that the system is rigged against him and his supporters by all manner of nefarious forces. “There has never been a president who was so evilly and illegally treated as I,” Trump declared after a New York judge scheduled sentencing for his criminal hush money conviction on Jan. 10, 10 days prior to his inauguration.\n\nAnd Trump’s disciples, including Katie Miller, insist they are being persecuted by the very same forces.\n\n“Victimhood is currency for women on the far right,” said Seyward Darby, author of Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism. “Women in this space hide when they play the victim. They hide their complicity. They play the ‘I’m just a nice woman or wife or mother or all of the above’ card and suggest that criticism of them is unwarranted because of that. They try to make themselves untouchable.”\n\nMiller has played that card herself. During a panel appearance on Piers Morgan’s show this fall, she got into an argument with Turkish American commentator Cenk Uygur after he criticized her husband for lying. “Piers, quite frankly, I’m really sick and tired of this racist bigoted rhetoric that can come from people like you against my husband, against my family and my children,” Miller said in a raised voice. “I am raising Jewish children in this country.”\n\nShe continued: “You better check your citizenship application that everything was legal and correct,” she said. “Because you’ll be just like Ilhan Omar coming next.”\n\nAfter college, Miller rose quickly through the ranks of the Republican Party, working for senators and the first Trump administration, where she met her future husband. The pair married in 2020. During the Biden years, Miller served as a senior adviser for P2 Public Affairs, a firm linked to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. At the time that Miller joined the firm, DeSantis was Trump’s main competitor for the 2024 Republican nomination. “It was not lost on others in Mr. Trump’s circle that the Miller family seemed well hedged for any outcome,” a report in the New York Times noted. After Trump clinched victory in the 2024 election, Miller came aboard his transition team as the media contact for Health and Human Services nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She told Politico that she had no plans to join the Trump administration and would remain at P2.\n\nThat soon changed. Elon Musk, who credited himself for Trump’s win, had become a near-constant fixture at Mar-a-Lago (much to the chagrin of Trump insiders) and was mapping out an expansive role for himself in the new administration. That role ended up being the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. The president wanted Miller involved. “Katie Miller will soon be joining DOGE!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She has been a loyal supporter of mine for many years.” Miller became Musk’s henchwoman, and Musk regularly spent time at the Millers’ residence. When Trump and Musk’s relationship inevitably imploded—their high-profile breakup playing out over a string of caustic posts online—Miller reportedly demurred from taking sides, and even had plans at one point to continue working for Musk in his private projects after he left the government.\n\nShe never followed through with those plans. But she did have Musk on her podcast earlier this month. Though it’s a low bar, the Musk episode is perhaps the most compelling of the bunch. He’s without question her biggest-name guest, someone whose daily habits, internal life, and personal tastes could be of genuine interest to the viewer. They discuss a range of subjects, such as Musk’s frustration that fashion isn’t evolving quickly enough, his views on DOGE’s legacy, and A.I.\n\nBut before long, Miller’s interview style arrives to once again flatten the proceedings. “Cheeseburgers are amazing,” Musk declares at one point. “A genius invention.”\n\nThe paradox of many content creators in the womanosphere is that they promote traditional gender roles—telling women that their main priorities should be to take care of their families—all while pursuing lucrative careers of their own. Miller is no exception: She may be out of politics, but her own effort to ascend in the right-wing media complex is plenty ambitious.\n\n“There is an imperative on the far right that women, even ones who are successful in business, politics, or other worldly spaces, must be traditionally feminine and care about traditionally feminine things,” said Darby. “They must purport to believe that their highest calling is being a wife and mother. They must embrace that calling as not just a personal one but also one in service of a nationalist agenda. Katie Miller is playing her part—or trying, anyway.”\n\nThat part was on full display when Miller hosted Katie Britt, the 43-year-old Republican senator from Alabama. Britt is, by any standard, ambitious and accomplished. In 2022, at age 40, she became the youngest GOP woman elected to the Senate—and the first female senator from Alabama. She has a law degree, which she got while a mother to two young children. She was elected president of the student’s government association while at the University of Alabama. She was invited to deliver the GOP rebuttal to Joe Biden’s State of the Union last year—and did so from her kitchen, of all places. “This is where our family has tough conversations,” Britt said. “It’s where we hold each other’s hands and pray for God’s guidance.”\n\nBut the podcast episode with Miller seems to be an opportunity for Britt to downplay her ambition, to remind everyone that she’s a mom and a wife first and foremost. It’s filmed in Britt’s home, and the two women sit on white floral armchairs in a Southern-style sunroom. Britt is, by her own description, a “Patriot wife” because she’s married to Wesley Britt, whom she met at the University of Alabama and who was a tackle for three seasons for the New England Patriots.\n\nBritt tells Miller that her decision to run for Senate was a religious calling, and that when her son was 10 years old, he came to her and asked to speak privately. He then presented her with a list of reasons for why she needed to run. “I want people to know how much you love Jesus,” he told her. “I want them to know what a good mom you are.” Then he added: “Mom, I definitely think they need to know about your passion for small business.”\n\nMiller talks to Britt about her weekly schedule, which generally requires senators to be in D.C. Monday through Thursday. “Do you cook Sunday nights for family dinner?” Miller asks Britt. Britt stammers in response: “I don’t always—you know, yes, I cook Sunday nights for dinner, but I was about to say, I don’t always crush it.”\n\nThere is one more thing to know about Miller’s podcast, and that is that so far it’s a flop.\n\nThe podcast was supposed to be soft-lit counterprogramming to the second Trump administration’s daily horrors. And Miller keeps bagging major guests—veritable Trump-orbit superstars, such as Pete Hegseth and Mike Johnson and their spouses, to say nothing of Musk. And yet, despite it all, its numbers have flatlined. Most of her YouTube episodes get mired in the 10,000-view mark, with a couple of exceptions. (The Musk interview racked up half a million views.) At least for now, her metrics put her far behind the likes of other conservative women podcasters: Influencers like Brett Cooper, Pearl Davis, and Allie Beth Stuckey easily get hundreds of thousands of views on their YouTube videos. Unlike Miller, they’ve been toiling in the proverbial content mines for years, and they now have the audience to show for it.\n\n“Despite what she said when she launched the show, she isn’t filling a gap in the cultural space,” said Darby. “There is already plenty of content out there for MAGA moms.”\n\nIf I’ve learned anything about Miller through talking to the people who’ve known her throughout her life, it’s that she cannot be happy about all this. (Miller did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nWhere is she going wrong? Why, with her pick of MAGA world for a guest list, is Miller finding a relatively puny audience?\n\nIt’s hard to say for certain. As is probably clear by now, Miller herself is neither a particularly compelling interviewer nor one who produces the types of viral moments that political podcasts thrive on in the current era. But the project’s faults may run deeper than that. The podcast seems engineered around highlighting the softer side of this administration’s figures. And that task may be impossible for half of Miller’s potential audience and not desired by the other.\n\nFor right-leaning MAGA skeptics, who could be won over by Hegseth’s wing choices at a time when he’s reveling in obliterating small ships off the coast of Venezuela? Who’s going to believe that Bondi is an aggrieved figure at a time when her Justice Department is openly, proudly serving as Trump’s personal score-settler?\n\nAnd for the MAGA faithful, are they really looking for these figures to be softened? What about this movement, born of mass rage and now on a four-year vengeance tour, suggests that the base is looking for any sort of cover?\n\nIt is, after all, a podcast aimed at making MAGA approachable to the center—and in Trump’s America, it has long been clear that the center cannot hold.\n\nThe most recent episode of the podcast features FBI Director Kash Patel and his girlfriend, country-music artist Alexis Wilkins. It begins with the disclaimer that the episode was recorded prior to the mass shooting at Brown University that left two dead, nine injured, and the shooter at large. The episode is full of idle chatter: Wilkins explains that she’s had to change her posting habits since getting booed up with the head of the FBI. Patel defends using a private jet to go see her, and discloses their shared love of a “surf and turf” night of lobster and steak.\n\nOne viewer left a comment: “We are not a serious country.”",

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.

    "fullText": "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Federal regulators will allow tech companies to effectively plug massive data centers directly into power plants, issuing a long-awaited order Thursday, as the Trump administration urges it to help the U.S. lead the world in artificial intelligence and revive domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's unanimous order is designed to clear up pressing issues around so-called “colocation” agreements in the nation's largest grid territory, which stretches across mid-Atlantic states to parts of Illinois and Indiana.\n\nBut it could become a blueprint for how FERC handles an October request from Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, to ensure that data centers and large manufacturers get the power they need as quickly as possible.\n\nIt also comes amid concerns that the mid-Atlantic territory covering some 65 million people will face electricity shortages in the coming years, as the build out of data centers outpaces the speed of new power sources coming online.\n\nLaura Swett, FERC’s chair, told Thursday's meeting that clearing the way for massive energy users — like data centers — to get electricity straight from power plants was a “critical step to give investors and consumers more certainty on how FERC believes we can solve the problem of meeting historic surging demand and realize our greatest potential as a country.”\n\nIt would, she said, also protect regular ratepayers, even as evidence mounts in various states that regular ratepayers are bearing the cost of new power plants and transmission lines to feed energy hungry data centers.\n\nPower plant owners applauded the step, as their share prices rose steeply in Thursday's trading. Advanced Energy United, whose members provide solar and wind power, said the FERC order should help clarify how big power users can set up their own power sources.\n\nThe Edison Electric Institute, which represents for-profit utilities, said only that it would “continue to work” to support rapid data center connection, protect ratepayers from cost-shifts and strengthen the grid for everyone.\n\nJeff Dennis, executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance, said the order showed that FERC is trying to address looming issues around fast-growing power demand and underscored the urgency to reform grid policy.\n\nThursday's order grew out of a dispute between power plant owners and electric utilities over a proposed colocation deal between Amazon’s cloud-computing subsidiary and the owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.\n\nFor tech giants, such arrangements represent a quick fix to quickly get power while avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.\n\nBut utilities protested that it allows big power users to avoid paying them to maintain the grid. Some consumer advocates maintained that diverting energy from existing power plants to data centers could drive up energy prices without an answer for how rising power demand will be met for regular ratepayers.\n\nFERC's Thursday order sets up a couple new regulatory tracks.\n\nIt requires the operator of the mid-Atlantic grid, PJM Interconnection, to develop rates and conditions for different colocation scenarios involving new power plants or sources.\n\nThat could mean allowing a big power user to pay for only the transmission services they use, considerably less than they might otherwise pay to connect to the grid through a utility.\n\nThe order also could require a big power user that colocates with an existing power plant to pay the cost to replace the energy that it diverts away from the broader electric grid.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "fullText": "A cardiac expert has warned he is “seriously concerned” about President Donald Trump’s health after watching his “manic” address to the nation.\n\nDr. Jonathan Reiner, a medical analyst for CNN who served as the late Vice President Dick Cheney’s cardiologist for over 30 years, posted a series of alarmed statements on X as Trump delivered his accelerated address.\n\nTrump sped through the 18-minute address, often taking an angry tone, and occasionally shouting the words he was reading off a teleprompter.\n\n“The pace of this address is manic,” Reiner wrote, noting that the tone of the speech also did not match the Christmas decorations displayed behind Trump.\n\nThe president squeezed in a brief festive greeting at the end, without cracking a smile.\n\n“I’m seriously concerned about the health of the president,” Reiner said of the 79-year-old, adding that, “No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nTrump’s health has been an ongoing concern this year, from his bruised hand to nodding off in Cabinet meetings.\n\nEarlier this month, Reiner fact-checked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when she announced that Trump’s second health check in a year included a “preventative MRI” to examine his heart and abdomen.\n\n“Well, there really is no preventative cardiac MRI,” Reiner said.\n\n“This is not a standard test for an 80-year-old man to undergo advanced imaging,” Reiner continued, saying the White House’s messaging had a “weird and defensive, evasive tone” to it.\n\nHe also pointed out that “preventative” abdominal imaging was especially peculiar.\n\n“This obviously was performed in response to some clinical concern, which is fine. Things happen to people as we all get older, and the president is almost 80,” said Reiner, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in D.C. “So, instead of this kind of evasive, almost laughable kind of note, just spell out what happened.\n\n“I hope the imaging is normal and great; that would be excellent news,” Reiner added. “But this kind of piece-by-piece, drip-by-drip release of information is just concerning.”\n\nThe breakneck pace and loud volume of Trump’s speech was also discussed on CNN’s NewsNight on Wednesday.\n\nOne theory is that CBS factored in a maximum 22-minute presidential interruption for Trump’s speech as part of the three-hour Survivor finale, which is always a ratings hit.\n\n“He was loud, he was forceful, he was fast,” author and journalist Terry Moran said of Trump.\n\n“The networks only gave him 15 minutes, supposedly. And that is a problem for him because he likes to ramble, he likes to improvise, and he sounded like a man shouting at the nation that entire time.”\n\nMoran said while Trump listed off “great things” he had done for the economy, “the facts of people’s own lives will refute you.”\n\n“I thought that was a huge mistake,” Moran said. “People think this economy is very bad for them personally and he’s shouting at them.”\n\nCNN political analyst and co-host on The View Ana Navarro said the speech was “18 minutes of their lives” people would never get back.\n\n“It was an angry old man shouting from the hills, shouting at the kids to get off their lawn,” Navarro said.\n\nShe said, “He interrupted the finale of Survivor, which has 4.5 million viewers. There’s a lot of Survivor fans for this old man to come and scream about how everything is great.”",

He was found dead Thursday evening from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.\n\nNeves Valente had studied at Brown on a student visa beginning in 2000, according to an affidavit from a Providence police detective. In 2017, he was issued a diversity immigrant visa and months later obtained legal permanent residence status, according to the affidavit. It was not immediately clear where he was between taking a leave of absence from the school in 2001 and getting the visa in 2017.\n\nThe diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the U.S., many of them in Africa. The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges.\n\nNearly 20 million people applied for the 2025 visa lottery, with more than 131,000 selected when including spouses with the winners. After winning, they must undergo vetting to win admission to the United States. Portuguese citizens won only 38 slots.\n\nLottery winners are invited to apply for a green card. They are interviewed at consulates and subject to the same requirements and vetting as other green-card applicants.\n\nTrump has long opposed the diversity visa lottery. Noem’s announcement is the latest example of using tragedy to advance immigration policy goals. After an Afghan man was identified as the gunman in a fatal attack on National Guard members in November, Trump’s administration imposed sweeping rules against immigration from Afghanistan and other counties.\n\nWhile pursuing mass deportation, Trump has sought to limit or eliminate avenues to legal immigration. He has not been deterred if they are enshrined in law, like the diversity visa lottery, or the Constitution, as with a right to citizenship for anyone born on U.S. soil. The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear his challenge to birthright citizenship.",

The TikTok chief executive officer, Shou Zi Chew, said in the memo that ByteDance and TikTok have signed binding agreements with the three investors.\n\nThe new TikTok US joint venture will be 50% held by a consortium of new investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX with 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance, according to the memo.\n\nWhite House officials have said Oracle, which was co-founded by Donald Trump’s supporter Larry Ellison, will license a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm as part of the deal, in a partnership that will expand on Oracle’s existing management of TikTok’s trove of data collected about its US users.\n\nEllison’s role in the new ownership of the most popular social media platform in the US has raised concerns about the decreasing share of media firms not under the control of pro-Trump billionaires, with Ellison’s son David now driving wholesale changes at CBS, Elon Musk in control of X, formerly known as Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg overseeing both Instagram and Facebook, and Jeff Bezos owning the Washington Post.\n\n“First Paramount/CBS and now TikTok,” Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Bluesky in response to the news. “Trump wants to hand over even more control of what you watch to his billionaire buddies. Americans deserve to know if the president struck another backdoor deal for this billionaire takeover of TikTok.”\n\nRush Doshi, who coordinated US government policy on China and Taiwan as a Biden National Security Council official, noted that there were “still some questions about who controls the algorithm. They say it will be trained on US data. Great, but has the algorithm been transferred, licensed, or is it still owned and controlled by Beijing – with Oracle merely providing ‘monitoring?’”\n\nThe agreement comes after a long delay. Trump said in September that he had spoken with China’s president over the phone about the deal and he had “a very good talk with president Xi” and “he gave us the go ahead”.\n\nIn October, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, announced that the US and China had “reached a final deal on TikTok”.\n\nIn 2020, during his first presidency, Trump had threatened to ban TikTok in retaliation for China’s handling of Covid.\n\nCongress later passed a ban of the app over security concerns that was signed into law in April 2024 by Joe Biden. The ban was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but implementation was pushed back multiple times by Trump while his administration worked to develop a deal to transfer ownership.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "A new poll indicates that support for President Trump is dwindling. Shockingly, that decline seems to be chiefly among MAGA and party-line Republicans. Support for the MAGA movement has also declined, with more Republicans identifying with the party rather than with Trump.\n\nThe new NBC News poll shows that the number of Americans who “strongly approve” of Trump has dropped from 26% in April to 21% now. The same survey also found the number of MAGA Republicans dropped from 78% to 70% in the same period.\n\nOn the flip side, the number of people who “strongly disapprove” of Trump increased from 42% to 44% from April to now. MAGA itself has also seen a decline since April, with the number of Republicans viewing themselves as part of the movement falling from 57% to 50%.\n\nMany of those surveyed cited financial concerns, particularly those surrounding food, affordable housing, and health care, as being the most critical issue to them. Many households are tightening their belts by cutting back on groceries, entertainment, and holiday spending.\n\nWhile overall inflation is down to 3%, costs have decreased for only a few goods, and wages haven’t increased meaningfully for most workers. As a result, some economists fear that stagflation might be a risk heading into 2026. Trump’s promise to end inflation and revitalize the economy has rang hollow for many voters. After a year, the majority of those surveyed found themselves in the same or worse position than a year ago.\n\nThe erosion is subtle but notable. Republican voters are not necessarily moving left, but they are showing fatigue with personality-driven politics. The poll suggests a growing desire for stability, predictability, and concrete economic relief. Whether that sentiment translates into lower turnout, primary challenges, or quiet disengagement could shape the party’s strategy heading into the 2026 midterm election cycle.\n\nThe post Poll Shows Shocking Trump Approval Number Change appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is already facing backlash for his so-called “warrior dividend” he announced during his national address on Wednesday night.\n\nTrump announced that 1.45 million military servicemembers will be receiving a $1,776 check ahead of Christmas as a result of tariff revenue and his “big beautiful bill” signed earlier this year. But skeptics immediately questioned how Trump was able to authorize sending out individual checks to service members without approval from Congress.\n\n“1,450,000 military service members will receive a special, we call warrior dividend before Christmas, a warrior dividend. In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776. Think of that. And the checks are already on the way,” Trump said during his speech.\n\n“We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more than our military. And I say congratulations to everybody. And by the way, we now have record enlistment in our military, and last year we had among the worst recruitment numbers in our military’s history. What a difference a year makes,” he added.\n\nHowever, online publication Defense One first reported that the funding for those checks actually comes from reconciliation funds that were approved by Congress to subsidize housing allowances for service members.\n\nA senior administration official told Defense One that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon “disburse $2.6 billion as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement” to all eligible service members.\n\n“Congress appropriated $2.9 billion to the Department of War to supplement the Basic Allowance for Housing entitlement within The One Big Beautiful Bill,” the senior official told Defense One in a statement. “Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 Reserve component military members will receive this supplement.”\n\nOVERNIGHT: President Trump’s $1,776 checks for 1.45 million troops announced Wednesday night come from Congressionally-allocated reconciliation funds intended to subsidize housing allowances for service members, a senior official confirmed to @DefenseOne.https://t.co/mGWski9Exl\n\n— Thomas Novelly (@TomNovelly) December 18, 2025\n\nThe report immediately sparked criticism on social media platform X.\n\n“I was wondering how Trump found his troop pay money without a congressional authorization/appropriation. He found it by taking it away from troop housing money. Always a con artist,” The Atlantic’s David Frum wrote on X.\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Walsh wrote: “Classic Trump. Everything he does is a lie, everything he does is just bullshit repackaging.”\n\nMeidasTouch editor-in-chief Ron Filipkowski posted: “Trump is taking money out their housing allowances approved by Congress and giving it to them in a ‘bonus’ so it looks like it came from him. It’s just a shell game with military pay from the ultimate con man.”\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D) said the “warrior dividend” is “no more than rebranded military housing allowances.”\n\n“Trump isn’t giving our brave service members a bonus, he’s just shuffling around money so he can claim he is. The level of disrespect for the intelligence of our troops is staggering,” she wrote on X.\n\nU.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), a veteran, also bashed Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Gee thanks, Donald. Your $1,776 ‘warrior checks’ aren’t Christmas bonuses—you’re just stealing money out of a fund meant to help our troops find affordable housing. Once a conman always a conman,\" Duckworth wrote.",

    "title": "Trump Is Doubling Down on His Disastrous A.I. Chip Policy",
    "description": "National security shouldn’t ever have a price.",
    "fullText": "President Trump announced last week that he would allow China to buy an advanced artificial intelligence chip, the H200, from the American company Nvidia, doubling down on a misguided decision he made over the summer to sell China another advanced chip, the H20. The H200 is about six times as powerful and will be an even greater boon to China’s military and A.I. development.\n\nMr. Trump explained that in return, the U.S. government will charge a 25 percent fee on all sales of the H200. But U.S. national security and technological dominance shouldn’t ever have a price — let alone such a low one.\n\nFor years, both the Trump and Biden administrations had successfully sought as large a lead as possible over China in A.I. In 2018, the first Trump administration wisely cut off key companies in China from the most advanced chip-making equipment. In 2020, Mr. Trump helped reverse the deployment of nonsecure Chinese 5G telecommunications networks by Britain and other allies by banning the sale of advanced chips to the Chinese tech giant Huawei. The Biden administration substantially expanded those controls and added new ones. Both administrations said that China would use American-made chips to develop more sophisticated A.I. and modernize its military.\n\nHampered by those policies, China has struggled to make advanced A.I. chips, despite a push of around $200 billion starting in 2014. None of China’s chips are close to matching the capacity of the H200. Huawei, a leading Chinese chipmaker, projects that it will not be able to match the H200’s performance until the end of 2027 at the earliest — and even that estimate sounds optimistic.\n\nIn addition to making less capable chips, China struggles to make them in large quantities. Trump administration officials testified in June that China will make just 200,000 chips per year — not even enough for a single data center. By contrast, Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the democratic world will produce more than 10 million far-superior chips per year. All told, China will produce a total computing power that is a mere 1 percent to 3 percent of what U.S. companies will produce.\n\nThe chief executive of DeepSeek, a prominent A.I. company in China, admitted in 2024 that access to chips was the company’s biggest impediment. In the summer of 2025, DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to train a new system on Chinese chips. When DeepSeek released its latest model several weeks ago, it acknowledged that the system still lags behind U.S. versions and cited computing limitations as the key reason.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump’s announcement last week, Chinese companies jumped at the chance to buy the H200 — more evidence that America’s chip advantage is real.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that selling chips to China will keep China “addicted” to American products and undermine its efforts to improve production. But China knows better. In the days since Mr. Trump announced his decision to sell the H200, there have been reports that China will invest an additional $70 billion to improve its domestic production of chips. According to a report on Sunday in the Global Times, which is controlled by China’s ruling party, Nvidia’s advanced chips would be used only until Chinese tech companies can transition to domestic alternatives.\n\nIt’s all part of the same pattern, whether the product is solar panels, electric vehicles or telecommunications: China imports Western technology until its own production catches up; then it cuts out American companies. President Xi Jinping has long said that relying on others for core technology “is like building a house on someone else’s foundation.”\n\nIt should be obvious that the United States should not sell China advanced technology that China could use to target American troops and intelligence officers. Advanced A.I. will improve China’s cyber operations, intelligence analysis and weaponry. According to reports, the Trump White House has concluded that Alibaba, one of China’s biggest A.I. companies, provides technology support for the Chinese military, including some of its operations against U.S. targets. (Alibaba has denied this claim.) Other reports suggest that DeepSeek evades U.S. export controls and aids Chinese military and intelligence operations. Chinese procurement documents show that the People’s Liberation Army is also trying to get its hands on advanced U.S. chips.\n\nThe bipartisan House committee on China was right when it said last week that China will use the H200 to “strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,” and when it recommended tightening export controls rather than loosening them.\n\nThe Trump administration is well aware of how much A.I. matters to national security, which makes its decision even more baffling. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, last week proclaimed, “The future of American warfare is here, and it’s spelled ‘A.I.’” And when the Department of Justice recently announced charges against two individuals accused of smuggling H200s to China, it underscored the national security issues: “These chips are the building blocks of A.I. superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control A.I. technology; the country that controls A.I. technology will control the future.”\n\nFor now, that country is the United States. In 2017, Li Keqiang, China’s premier at the time, told Mr. Trump during a meeting in Beijing that China would come to dominate all technologies, including A.I., and that America would export little more than soybeans and corn. Last week’s decision helps make that unlikely dream a reality.\n\nBen Buchanan is an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an adviser to A.I. and cybersecurity companies.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is easing some federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday that will reclassify marijuana to a Schedule III drug, putting it on par with drugs like ketamine and anabolic steroids.\n\n\"We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain,\" Trump said during an event in the Oval Office, flanked by several doctors.\n\nThe order falls short of fully legalizing marijuana, but it will make it easier for researchers to study the drug.\n\nTrump said that he had been lobbied to make the change by people with extreme pain, incurable diseases, and seizure disorders, among others. The president noted the substance's medical uses, including as a \"substitute for addictive and potentially lethal opioid painkillers.\"\n\nThe move could also bring tax relief to marijuana businesses operating in states that have already legalized the substance.\n\nMarijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug, a category for substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\" according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nSchedule III drugs, on the other hand, have a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\"\n\nMarijuana stocks surged last week amid widespread rumors of Trump's impending order. Most of the sector's most prominent names continued trending upward with this week on mounting speculation for the pro-cannabis policy decision.\n\nNews of Trump signing the executive order continued to boost the industry's biggest players. Tilray Brands, typically seen as a leader among cannabis stocks, jumped 6% today while Aurora Cannabis rose 9% and Canopy Growth Corporation spiked 11%.\n\nThese cannabis stocks are all relatively small cap and are prone to price swings, but the signing of an executive order is a highly bullish catalyst for the industry.\n\nAs he campaigned for a third time in 2024, Trump signaled that he would take a friendlier approach toward marijuana than he did during his first term.\n\n\"I promised to be the president of common sense, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" Trump said on Thursday.\n\nHe said that he would vote for a ballot measure in Florida aimed at legalizing marijuana for recreational use in the state. That measure garnered 56% of the vote but ultimately fell short of the 60% required for passage.\n\nTrump also said in 2024 that he supported enacting laws to make it easier for marijuana businesses to operate.",

Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who sits on the center’s board, posted a video to X after the announcement making it clear that she was on the call when the decision was made and was muted so she could not voice her dissenting opinion.\n\n“What you may hear is that there was a unanimous vote to rename the Kennedy Center the Trump Center,” Beatty said. “Be clear, I was on that call and as I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions, and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted. Each time I tried to speak I was muted. Participants were not allowed to voice their concerns who were online yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.”\n\nFor the record. This was not unanimous. I was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this  move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda. This was not consensus.

He hinted at the name change in October in a Truth Social post.\n\nThe proposal to change the name of the center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was also lambasted online by members of President John F. Kennedy’s family on Thursdasy.\n\n“Perhaps the board isn’t aware that the Kennedy Center is the memorial to the president of the United States, John F.

It is not.”\n\nJoe Kennedy III added that altering the Kennedy Center could “no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.”\n\nIn July, House Republican’s introduced a bill that aimed to strip former President Kennedy’s name from the center, turning it into the Trump Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe center’s name change was part of legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Onder (R-Missouri) called the Make Entertainment Great Again (MEGA) Act. Onder noted in his bill proposal that Trump was intended “to preserve the integrity of the fine arts by ending woke programming and rebalancing the Kennedy Center’s $234 million budget” since being elected chairman.\n\nThe post Kennedy Center Board Member Says Opposition to Trump Renaming Was Censored as JFK Family Condemns Move: ‘An Insult’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "title": "Trump Was Slammed For Leveling This 'Disgusting' 3-Word Phrase — And It Might Reveal A Lot",
    "description": "People were outraged by the president's recent use of this particular expression. Experts in political science and mental health say the term tells quite the story.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump recently leveled one of his commonly used terms in a statement attacking iconic actor and director Rob Reiner shortly after he and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead at their home on Sunday.\n\nThe president took to his Truth Social platform on Monday to seize on the opportunity to slam Rob Reiner, who was a critic of Trump, and for baselessly attributing the Hollywood filmmaker’s death to “Trump Derangement Syndrome” — a phrase Trump and his supporters often use to attack those who criticize the president, his policies and his rhetoric.\n\nLife: Psychologists React To THAT Post From Trump About Rob Reiner's Death\n\n“Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS,” Trump wrote in part on the social media platform.\n\nTrump’s vile post about Reiner garnered wide condemnation, with many on social media describinghis remarks as“disgusting.” Rocker Jack White took to Instagram to slam the president, writing: “Trump you disgusting, vile, egomaniac, loser, child. Neither he nor any one of his followers can defend this gross, horrible insult to a beautiful artist who gave the world so much.”\n\nThe president also garnered a rare rebuke from many MAGA supporters and a number of the president’s most loyal advocates. He was further criticized when he doubled down on his attacks on Reiner while speaking to reporters at the Oval Office hours later.\n\nThe concept of a so-called “derangement syndrome” has been used against critics of past presidents before. But Trump has a history of frequently using the phrase against his naysayers himself. He had also used the expression against those who opposed him during his first term as president.\n\nLife: How To Do That 'Defying Gravity' Riff Without Murdering Your Voice\n\nAlexandra Cromer, a licensed professional counselor with Thriveworks, believes that Trump’s habit of leveling the phrase “Trump Derangement Syndrome” reveals a lot about his leadership style.\n\n“It reveals that he is not a leader that values, welcomes, or is willing to receive feedback,” she told HuffPost. “This also is a behavior pattern that we see in people with narcissistic tendencies; projection of perceived criticism onto someone else.”\n\nCromer explained that by Trump calling his critics “deranged,” he’s essentially seeking to undermine “the authenticity of the feedback.”\n\n“This reveals that his leadership style is very rigid and very one-dimensional. He is the one to give directions and all others must comply,” she said. “This is a tremendously unhealthy way to receive criticism or any other form of feedback. Psychologically, we know that feedback is critical to not only growth [and] prosperity, but overall health and wellness.”\n\nLife: The Funniest Posts From Women This Week (Dec. 6-12)\n\nShe later continued, “shutting down criticism by engaging in stereotyping and blaming of the source can also be viewed as abusive behavior — that is, behavior that attempts to inflict psychological harm and maintain power structures.”\n\nHallie Kritsas, a licensed mental health counselor and therapist with Thriveworks who specializes in self-esteem, workplace issues and anxiety, told HuffPost that she believes the term “Trump Derangement Syndrome” is “polarizing and emotionally activating.”\n\n“It comes across as a threat and will more than likely increase stress and divide groups in two different ones versus unifying them,” she said.\n\nJacob Neiheisel, associate professor of political science at the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences, told HuffPost that he thinks Trump’s frequent use of the phrase is “meant to be dismissive of his opposition” and intended to “give his followers cover for dismissing similar criticisms that they might hear.”\n\nLife: The Most Popular Dog Names Of 2025\n\n“I think his use of the term reflects his deep-seated disdain for dissent,” he said. “Trump’s leadership style is certainly not one that is welcoming of a ‘team of rivals’ type of approach, but rather one that demands loyalty and a willingness to do political combat on his behalf.”\n\nNeiheisel thinks that the “Trump Derangement Syndrome” phrase has caught on with so many Trump supporters because it “allows them to adopt a similar orientation toward dissent in their own social environments.”\n\n“Simply dismissing the opposition as having a form of mental illness allows them to protect their own attitudes and beliefs, inoculating them against any negativity directed toward Trump,” he added.\n\nNeiheisel thinks that Trump’s attack on Reiner after his death hit “a new low.”\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\n“Republicans had the moral high ground in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder and were able to use the negative things said about Kirk after his death to attack Democrats,” he said. “With Trump’s response, that high ground is gone. I think that’s why we saw a number of Republicans condemning Trump’s remarks.”\n\nKritsas believes that Trump’s statements about the iconic director “violated what some might view as a time to grieve and have decency in a moment of loss.”\n\nCromer said that Trump’s harsh words for Reiner was likely particularly upsetting to so many people because the filmmaker was a “universally liked person.”\n\n“While Rob was not a perfect person (because nobody is), he demonstrated consistent prosocial behavior patterns and centered his personal values at the forefront of his personal and professional life,” she said.\n\n“Further, Trump’s remarks state a belief that someone was murdered because they didn’t like Trump; an assertion that can be viewed as narcissistic by inserting himself into a situation that had nothing to do with him in any contextual way,” she continued.\n\nCromer later added that overall, Trump’s remarks about Reiner “communicates a lack of respect for psychological and personal boundaries for those affected by this incident.”\n\nMedical Examiner Report States Rob And Michele Reiner’s Cause Of Death\n\n2 Of Rob Reiner's Children Release Statement On Parents' Deaths\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says the U.S. is on the cusp of something “this country has never seen” — and he’s crediting his much-discussed tariff policy.\n\nSpeaking at a White House Christmas reception, Trump argued that tariffs are driving a manufacturing revival, pointing to the auto industry as a prime example (1).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\n“Our car industry … went to Europe, they went to Mexico, Japan — they went all over. They went to South Korea,” Trump said. “And now it’s just the opposite. They’re all coming back. We have an age that’s coming up, the likes of which this country has never seen.”\n\nTrump pointed to Toyota, which recently announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in its U.S. operations over the next five years (2). According to Trump, companies are increasingly choosing to build in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\n\n“So they’re coming from Germany, they’re coming from Japan, they’re coming from Canada. Many factories are coming in because they don’t want to pay tariffs — very simple. They’re coming in and they’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars,” he said.\n\nThe result, Trump says, could be a historic economic upswing.\n\n“We have a country that potentially is geared to have the most incredible golden years ever,” he said, adding that when factories open up “by the thousands,” it would mark “the golden age of America.”\n\nTo be sure, that manufacturing boom has yet to materialize. According to the Institute for Supply Management, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month in November (3).\n\nStill, Trump insists the turnaround is coming soon.\n\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year. I think you’ll see results — we’ve never had anything like it,” he said.\n\nWhile Trump’s tariff policies have drawn criticism, major companies continue to view the U.S. as one of the most dependable places to build and grow. That confidence is showing up in the scale of capital they’re committing — across multiple industries.\n\nFor instance, Apple has announced a sweeping $600 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and workforce training (4). Johnson & Johnson plans to put $55 billion into U.S. manufacturing, research and development and new technologies (5). Hyundai, meanwhile, is investing $26 billion in the U.S. to boost automotive production capacity, localize key components and accelerate work on future industries (6).",

    "fullText": "Former model Stacey Williams said Donald Trump groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 while her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein watched on in what she described as “some sort of twisted game.”\n\nAs the clock ticks down to the Friday deadline to release the remaining Epstein files, the 57-year-old former Sports Illustrated swimsuit model opened up to The Daily Beast Podcast about her brief relationship with the late sex offender when she was in her twenties and he was in his forties.\n\nWilliams told host Joanna Coles that she met Epstein at a dinner party with other models, “and that’s how I started dating him, which led to, obviously, months later, him walking me into Trump Tower to be groped, assaulted by Donald Trump while the two men stood there and walked and talked as it was happening.”\n\nEpstein and Trump were close friends for many years until a bitter falling-out, supposedly over Epstein poaching Trump’s staff.\n\nIn retrospect, Williams said, it made sense why Epstein kept directing her toward Trump Tower while they were out on a walk and convinced her to “just drop by and see him.”\n\n“I do remember little snippets of Trump saying, ‘Oh yeah, her career is on fire.’ You know, that thing that he does: ‘Everything’s the best,’” she said. “And Jeffrey just kept—he didn’t intervene. He watched it, and then he raged at me in the elevator and on the way down that I allowed it to happen. You know, either it was some sort of twisted game, and he didn’t get the result he wanted. Maybe it was a bet. I don’t know, but I’m confident that that is what occurred.”\n\nShe ended her romance with Epstein soon after.\n\n“I just said, ‘Jeffrey, you are extremely mentally ill and you need to get help. There’s something deeply wrong with you. And stop calling me. I don’t want anything to do with you.’ And he, oddly enough—this is hard for people to understand—but he got weepy. He was very sad.”\n\nThe model previously told The Daily Beast Podcast that Trump “came out of his office right outside of, in sort of the waiting area, and started groping me while the two of them continued having a casual conversation… He’s just moving his hands sort of up and down my body and, like, smiling at him. And Jeffrey smiling back.”\n\nWilliams first went public with her allegations against Trump on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call last year. Though she told NBC News at the time that she had no communications with the Kamala Harris campaign team, that didn’t stop the White House from accusing her of having political motivations.\n\n“These accusations were unequivocally false when they were first contrived and nothing has changed. Democrats and the mainstream media are desperately trying to use this hoax as a distraction to talk about anything other than President Trump’s tremendous successes,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt similarly said, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris Campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false.”\n\nUnder the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Trump’s Department of Justice must release the federal investigation files related to the disgraced financier by Friday.\n\nThe co-author of the law, California Democrat Ro Khanna, warned that Justice Department officials “could be subject to prosecution given the federal law” and “hauled in front of Congress, the Oversight Committee” if they fail to release the files on time.\n\nNew episodes of The Daily Beast Podcast are released every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday.

    "description": "Trump was applauded by MAGA allies for his economic-focused primetime address, despite polls showing that most voters are feeling the opposite.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump was showered with praise by GOP lawmakers and MAGA allies as he insisted that the economy is stronger than how most Americans feel in a primetime speech from the White House.\n\nDuring an 18-minute address, Trump attacked his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, and touted his record on immigration, tariffs and culture issues, arguing that the “Golden Age” he proposed on the campaign trail is building momentum. He also announced his administration will be sending $1,776 bonuses, which he called “warrior dividends,” to nearly 1.5 million U.S. service members before Christmas.\n\n“I inherited a mess, and I’m fixing it,” Trump said Wednesday night.\n\nThe speech came as Trump has oscillated on his messaging on the economy, boasting it as the “best” to repeatedly labeling affordability as a “hoax” — all while polls show that voters need convincing.\n\nAn NPR/PBS News/Marist poll released hours before he spoke found that the president’s economic approval hit a new low at 36%. A new Fox News poll revealed similar, with most voters believing the economy is in bad shape.\n\nBut while his address was ruthlessly ripped by Democrats, his supporters were singing an entirely different tune.\n\n“He very clearly said to the American people, ‘I see you,’ and look at the things we’ve done,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) said on Fox News. “What he has accomplished in just these first 10, 11 months is remarkable, but I think more is yet to come.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich dubbed Trump’s address as “worthy of Ronald Reagan.”\n\n“That was a good speech. It was an important speech,” Gingrich said on Fox News. “Someday, people will say it was one of the most important speeches of his career because it set the table for the entire debate over the next year.”\n\nIn a post on X, Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) supported the president’s attacks against the Affordable Care Act, as subsidies are set to expire by the end of the month.\n\n“Republicans will fix what Democrats broke!” he wrote.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) also weighed in on X: “High energy, great delivery, grand slam, home run on making the case that the best is yet to come.”\n\nA popular MAGA account posted that Trump “just shows up and performs under pressure.”\n\n“We’ve never seen anything like this in our lifetimes,” the user wrote. “I couldn’t feel more secure with him steering the ship.”\n\nIn the background, the economy remains one of the top concerns of voters heading into the 2026 midterm elections, which could be seen as a litmus test for Trump and the GOP as they look to maintain control of the House and Senate.\n\nAfter Democrats scored sweeping victories in November, Trump has since increased his focus on the key issue.\n\n“I have no higher priority than making America affordable again,” Trump said during a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania last week. “They caused the high prices and we’re bringing them down.”",

    "fullText": "The move: Trump Media & Technology Group stock surged as much as 34% on Thursday. The parent company of Truth Social has struggled in 2025, with shares down 60% year-to-date.\n\nWhy: Trump Media is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in an all-stock deal worth $6 billion.\n\nThe combined company is expected to complete a utility-scale fusion power plant in the coming year, creating one of the first publicly traded fusion energy companies to date.\n\nThe announcement from TAE casts the deal as a part of the push to advance US interests in the AI space, in addition to energy security.\n\n\"Trump Media & Technology Group built uncancellable infrastructure to secure free expression online for Americans, and now we're taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations.\"\n\n\"Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant, and dependable electricity that would help America win the A.I. revolution and maintain its global economic dominance,\" the statement added.\n\nWhat it means: President Donald Trump has been focused on advancing US AI dominance over rivals like China. The deal is being viewed as an AI play as much as an announcement in the energy space.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said investors should view the deal as a positive signal for both the tech and energy sectors.\n\n\"We expect Big Tech to focus on partnering/looking to acquire future energy sources over the coming years to fuel their AI ambitions as energy remains the biggest constraint in my view,\" he said. \"This is an arms race both between US Big Tech and more broadly between the US and China heading into a key 2026 which will further define the winners in this AI Revolution.\"",

June 14 was also Donald Trump's 79th birthday.\n\nMelania Trump escorted Donald Trump onstage for his remarks at the event, but did not issue any statement of her own. She wore a pinstriped ivory skirt suit by Adam Lippes.\n\nThe first couple watched the July Fourth fireworks display from the White House. They also hosted a military family picnic on the South Lawn earlier in the day.\n\nAlso that day, Donald Trump signed his tax and spending bill, which he dubbed his \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" after it was passed by the House of Representatives on July 3.\n\nShe wore a white shirtdress by Thom Browne.\n\nThe first couple visited Texas a week after the Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes as rain battered the region, leaving more than 130 dead. The Trumps met with families of victims, first responders, and local officials.\n\n\"It's a horrible thing, it's a horrible thing,\" Donald Trump told the press as he departed the White House on July 11. \"Nobody can even believe it — that much water that fast.\"\n\nAt a press conference in Texas, Melania Trump said, \"My deepest sympathy to all of the parents who lost beautiful young souls — deepest sympathy from all of us to the community, to everybody who lost a loved one. We are grieving with you. Our nation is grieving with you.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Melania Trump watched Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.\n\nDonald Trump, who received both cheers and boos at the game, called it \"a great match.\"\n\nMelania Trump watched the game from behind her bright-white Dior sunglasses, which resembled the Vuarnet glasses worn by Sam Altman at Sun Valley just days earlier.

It will certainly be impactful.\"\n\nThe couple welcomed the prince, who had met with Trump earlier in the day, to a state dinner at the White House.\n\nThe first lady wore a floor-length Elie Saab gown in what The New York Times dubbed \"Saudi green,\" noting it was a similar hue to the green of Saudi Arabia's flag.\n\nMelania Trump and Usha Vance stopped by DeLalio Elementary School on the Marine Corps Air Station New River, part of the Camp Lejeune Community Schools system.\n\nThe Official White House Christmas tree, an 18-foot concolor fir from Sidney, Michigan, was displayed in the Blue Room as part of the first lady's White House Christmas decorations.\n\nMelania Trump wore a cream Christian Dior coat with red gloves and Manolo Blahnik heels in holiday plaid.\n\nDonald Trump pardoned two turkeys named Gobble and Waddle.

    "fullText": "Exclusive: UK government’s ‘naive belief’ that Trump is a good faith actor ‘could cost UK taxpayer billions’, says health select committee chair\n\nMinisters and senior MPs have warned that the UK’s agreements with Donald Trump are “built on sand” after the Guardian established that the deal to avoid drug tariffs has no underlying text beyond limited headline terms.\n\nThe “milestone” US-UK deal announced this month on pharmaceuticals, which will mean the NHS pays more for medicines in exchange for a promise of zero tariffs on the industry, still lacks a legal footing beyond top lines contained in two government press releases.\n\nConcerns over the basis of the agreement have been heightened by Washington’s decision to suspend the £31bn “tech prosperity deal”, which had been hailed as “a generational step-change in our relationship with the US”. The deal was paused after the US claimed a lack of progress from the UK in lowering trade barriers in other areas.\n\nIt has also emerged that concessions to British farmers made in the first tariff deal with Trump, which were hailed as “historic” by Keir Starmer in May, have yet to be signed off by the US despite a looming January deadline.\n\nThe health department said that negotiators were now thrashing out the detailed agreement on the pharmaceutical deal. Asked to provide the headline terms, the department shared its press release hailing the “landmark UK-US pharmaceuticals deal” and a link to the equivalent US government announcement of an “agreement in principle” on pharmaceutical pricing.\n\nCritics have noted that the two releases describe the deal in sharply different terms. The British release describes the UK as “the only country in the world to secure a 0% tariff on pharmaceuticals to the US”, while the American one largely focuses on how the NHS will have to pay 25% more for new medicines.\n\nDavid Henig, a trade expert, said: “There is a serious risk that the UK government has made commitments to raise drug prices in return for nothing more than a verbal promise from President Trump around zero tariffs, when we know he has form for not honouring his word.\n\n“The role of private companies in possibly working with the US administration to coerce the UK government by threatening to withdraw investments is also a big worry. None of this is normal in international trade policy and the government needs to explain both this deal and how such things will be avoided in the future.”\n\nOrdinarily, negotiators would sign a provisional legal text, which would then go through detailed checks on both sides, but none exists yet with the US on pharmaceuticals.\n\nMinisters privately told the Guardian there were concerns that the government’s agreements with the US were flimsy and unreliable.\n\nOne said there was a concern that the UK’s series of agreements with the Trump administration were “built on sand”. Another said this instability was the “new normal now in our relationship across the pond” with “additional layers of volatility and unpredictability in the system”.\n\nLayla Moran, who chairs the health select committee, said: “The only thing more surprising than Trump’s tween-level temper tantrums is the UK government’s naive belief that his administration is a good faith actor. The NHS is too precious to be gambled with and the concern now is whether the deal that could already cost the UK taxpayer billions could end up costing a lot more if it collapses in chaos.”\n\nLiam Byrne, who chairs the business and trade select committee, said ministers had to focus on getting the tech prosperity deal “back on track”.\n\nGovernment figures downplayed the chances of the US reneging on the pharma deal, which took weeks longer to finalise than expected. One source said the US pharmaceutical industry had been pushing for the agreement as they wanted certainty on imports and drug prices, while by comparison the tech prosperity deal “was always quite abstract”.\n\nOfficials admit that, more broadly, volatility is part and parcel of dealing with the Trump administration. But they note that through the deals it has signed, the UK has secured concrete outcomes for businesses.\n\n“The fact we have 25% steel tariffs, and that’s better than the rest of the world, is not flimsy. The same thing with our auto rate,” one official said. “We are in a more competitive position than other major economies.”\n\nIssues have emerged in the implementation of the landmark US-UK tariff deal agreed last May, however, with quotas on beef exports that were due to kick in next month still not formally approved.\n\nTom Bradshaw, the president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our understanding is that the US has not yet signed off the 13,000 reciprocal tariff rate quota. With the US already having access to our beef market for non-hormone treated beef, we are pushing to make sure UK beef producers can access the reciprocal quota from 1 January as agreed.\n\n“This is particularly important as we know there is still great pressure from other sectors of the economy to reopen US negotiations, and that our government is looking at what more can be done with the US. We urge the government to keep pushing to get the reciprocal quota over the line before the end of the year to ensure it can’t continue to be used as a bargaining chip.”\n\nApart from introducing a 10% tariff on most British exports – lower than the rate paid by other countries – the deal was to “remove tariffs on British steel and aluminium, reducing them to zero”. This aspect of the agreement has not materialised, with tariffs on British steel remaining at 25%, although other countries pay a rate of 50%.\n\nOne industry leader said the discussions on steel tariffs “were not going anywhere” but that they considered this week’s bump in the road to be a matter of the “US blustering because of frustration with the UK not moving fast enough in other areas”.\n\nThe US informed the UK it was pausing the tech prosperity deal over wider trade disagreements last week before Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, held meetings with senior US officials in Washington, including commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nSeveral officials said those meetings were “very positive”. The two sides have agreed to resume negotiations in January.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Our special relationship with the US remains strong and the trade secretary held talks last week in the US with counterparts to keep up the momentum on implementing all aspects of the UK-US deal so businesses on both sides of the Atlantic continue to feel the benefits.\n\n“We have already delivered 0% tariffs for the UK pharma and aerospace sectors and cut auto tariffs to 10% within quota, saving hundreds of millions of pounds on UK exports, with the US confirming changes via federal notices.\n\n“The UK is also the only country to have avoided 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, but we are committed to going further to secure jobs and creating opportunities for businesses, and at the state visit we unveiled commercial deals creating more than 7,600 high-quality jobs and accelerating growth.”",

    "description": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.",
    "fullText": "The footage was grainy but unmistakable: US marines fast-roping from a black hawk helicopter onto the deck of an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nSeizing the vessel, one of Caracas’ sanctioned “ghost ships” illegally shipping crude oil, was the prelude to the second act of Donald Trump’s campaign to topple Nicolas Maduro.\n\nWithin days, the US president announced a full naval blockade designed to sever the Venezuelan president’s economic lifeline and compel his loyal inner circle to oust him.\n\n“Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before,” Mr Trump declared on Tuesday.\n\nInsiders see the move as a creative new calculus aimed at starving Mr Maduro’s government, whose survival depends on selling crude oil abroad, while simultaneously forcing his allies in Moscow and Beijing to abandon him.\n\n“The White House is committed to the effort against the regime and seeing Maduro ousted,” a source close to the administration said.\n\nThis is the plan behind Mr Trump’s unprecedented blockade and the campaign the White House hopes rids Venezuela of its global influence.\n\nPerched in his presidential office in Miraflores Palace, Mr Maduro has relied on the export of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves to prop up his country.\n\nBeneath him lies more crude oil than Saudi Arabia, Russia or the United States and the mineral, dubbed “liquid gold”, accounts for about 88 per cent of Venezuela’s $24bn in exports.\n\nSince 2019, Mr Trump has sought to stop that.\n\nIn his first term, the US Treasury sanctioned Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, and threatened secondary sanctions on any entity doing business with it.\n\nTo get around this, Mr Maduro’s government has turned to a clandestine “dark fleet” of tankers to evade sanctions and keep oil flowing to buyers in China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nHundreds of ageing tankers now smuggle sanctioned oil, acting as a financial lifeline to Caracas. As of late November, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions.\n\nIt is a growing phenomenon. Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.\n\nThe tactic appears to be working. Despite international pressure, oil exports rose to some 921,000 barrels per day in November, the third-highest monthly average so far this year.\n\n“What they’re doing is essentially trying to cut off any remaining source of revenue for the government, to try to rattle the government into changing the regime,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n\nIndeed, oil tanker seizures are viewed by experts as the final act in Mr Trump’s chapter of maximum pressure that began with sanctions years before.\n\n“The revenue that is coming in from oil is something that the regime has long since used as a tool to buy influence within the military and maintain what little the government still is able to produce in the form of oil,” Andrés Martínez-Fernández, senior policy analyst for Latin America at the Allison Centre for National Security, explained.\n\n“It’s very quickly going to create instability to a new level within Venezuela and the regime.”\n\nRelations between Washington and Caracas are at a nadir. The US and many of its allies consider Mr Maduro, who is currently serving his disputed third term, as a dictator.\n\nYet thanks to the export of Venezuela’s oil, Mr Maduro has formed a network of loyal military commanders and international allies who keep his reign afloat.\n\nNone have become more important than China, which is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil, taking roughly 80 per cent of its exports. Every day it imports around 746,000 barrels of oil.\n\nBeijing has taken the oil not as a commercial import but as debt repayment towards an estimated $60bn in loans it has poured into Venezuelan oil projects.\n\nThe repayment deal suited both sides. Beijing secured oil while Maduro gained time and a friend on the international stage.\n\nThe blockade now threatens to derail the relationship and turn China against Mr Maduro as the ghost fleet of tankers stop arriving in Beijing’s ports.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil can no longer be delivered reliably, then Mr Maduro ceases to be an asset to China and becomes a legal liability as it chases repayment.\n\n“Once shipments stop arriving at foreign ports, the debts start getting called in. And that’s going to have an immediate impact. Things are going to start breaking down quickly, physical infrastructure, if these payments don’t start to come in,” Mr Martínez-Fernández explained.\n\n“It could get to a point where China says, ‘we would be better off being rid of this headache and being rid of Maduro, then by continuing any kind of active support.”\n\nBeijing has shown little sympathy to similar situations in the past. In Africa and Central Asia, the state has repeatedly distanced itself from leaders it no longer sees as reliable partners.\n\nFor Mr Trump, the blockade is another step in his plan dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, which aims to rid America’s backyard of Chinese influence.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation doctrine long believed to be a blueprint for his second term, calls it “re-hemisphering”. It calls for the capture of supply chains in the region as a requirement of US economic security.\n\nIn that sense, the blockade is not aimed at confronting China head on but at making Mr Maduro persona non grata. If the oil-for-debt deal collapses, Beijing may consider switching horses and abandoning him.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs is Havana, which has long relied on subsidised Venezuelan oil.\n\nCuba, which has been the subject of its own US blockade, has been receiving some 24,000 barrels of crude, gasoline and jet fuel per day from the regime.\n\nMr Sabatini said the blockade will be “catastrophic” for Cuba, a historic enemy of the US, and estimates that exports will drop dramatically.\n\n“This is the moment that people like Marco Rubio [the secretary of state] and Cuban-American hardliners living in Florida have been waiting for,” he said.\n\n“They’re trying to starve the government. By doing that, then they actually starve the people too.”\n\nWhile China has poured millions into Venezuelan oil projects, Russia has been a key enabler in the shadows.\n\nA Russian-linked “dark fleet” of tankers have also helped Mr Maduro avoid sanctions by shipping his oil around the globe. However, Putin, who has sought to curry favour with Mr Trump since his return to the Oval Office, may redirect the vessels, further isolating Mr Maduro.\n\nIndeed, signs of Moscow’s shift in position are already there. Reports from late November suggested that Russia had initiated the evacuation of its citizens from the region.\n\nExperts agree that Mr Trump is attempting to squeeze Mr Maduro economically while testing the resolve of his few remaining allies in the hope they turn against him.\n\n“It does seem to be another way for the administration to ratchet up the pressure against the Maduro government,” said Brian Finucane, a former state department lawyer who is now senior adviser at the International Crisis Group.\n\nThe formation of the armada, the largest US military presence in the region in decades, began with a series of strikes on boats the Trump administration claimed were ferrying illegal narcotics to the US.\n\nFor months, American forces have launched lethal strikes on small vessels skimming through international waters under the banner of anti-drug operations.\n\nUS navy and coastguard units have destroyed around 20 boats since early September, killing over 90 people.\n\nEight warships, including three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship now make up the largest US military presence in the region in decades.\n\nThey are joined by a squadron of F-35B Lightning II jets and a handful of Reaper drones, which are capable of flying long distances and carrying up to eight laser-guided missiles. B-2 bombers have also been spotted flying off the coast.\n\nIt has led many Venezuelans, and many Americans, to believe that Mr Trump is preparing for war.\n\nThe blockade, insiders suggest, is one of the lesser military escalations the president had been weighing with his cabinet in recent weeks.\n\nInstead, they hope to turn the very cartels that military officials say are complicit in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US, against their leader by choking their cash flow, which is used to finance them.\n\nFor the armed forces, oil revenue is the glue that keeps the system intact. Generals control ports, customs and fuel distribution, making the military a pillar of Mr Maduro’s power.\n\nAs long as Mr Maduro can afford to pay his generals, their unfettered loyalty and in turn, his regime, will continue.\n\nThe same logic applies to Mr Maduro’s alleged relationship with organised crime. These groups rely on access to ports and laundering routes, all of which are sustained by the cash generated by oil sales.\n\n“It doesn’t take us yet to the place where we’re going into Venezuelan territory and conducting military strikes. We’re still talking about operations in international waters,” Mr Martínez-Fernández said.\n\nThe formation of the armada, coupled with Mr Trump’s continued threat of land strikes, have led experts to believe that the blockade is part of a slide towards conflict.\n\nTop military officials are said to have presented the US president with options for military intervention in the region which include land strikes. Other options reported to have been drawn up by the Pentagon include direct attacks on Mr Maduro’s security detail or operations to seize the country’s oil fields.\n\nIn each, Mr Trump is said to be against ideas that may place American troops at risk or could turn into an embarrassing failure.\n\nMr Trump and his cabinet have begun framing the blockade as a necessary intervention to reclaim “American oil”.\n\nSo what is stopping him? Perhaps his thirst for the Nobel Peace Prize and the potential blowback amongst his America First base if he started a war.\n\nWhat happens next will be determined by Mr Trump’s blockade. If oil flow continues, Mr Maduro survives.\n\nBut if it is stopped, China may decide the debt is not worth collecting and his cash-poor lieutenants may turn against him.\n\nThe gamble in Washington is simple; regimes do not fall when they are attacked but when they are abandoned.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

In his first stop in Philadelphia, he defended his tariffs and called the Democrats' criticism that his policies are driving up prices a \"hoax.\"\n\nTrump had also promised other checks in the past. He's floated such a $2,000 tariff dividend for every American below a certain income level, though congressional Republicans have balked at the idea. And he announced a $10,000 bonuse to select Transportation Security Administration employees for remaining at their posts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, a move that is sure to infuriate China.\n\nThe State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump’s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China’s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.\n\nThe eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS — similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia — worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nOther sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.\n\nIn separate but nearly identical statements, the State Department said the sales serve “U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.”\n\n“The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,” the statements said.\n\nUnder federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain “sufficient self-defense capabilities” and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense “is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,” the ministry said.\n\nTaiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its “long-term support for regional security and Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities,” which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.\n\nThe arms sales comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.\n\nThe U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Trump is expected to sign shortly.\n\nLast week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor.\n\n“The bill has kept playing up the ‘China threat’ narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China’s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,” Beijing’s embassy in Washington said after the legislation passed the House.\n\n“China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,” it said.\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.\n\nMistreanu reported from Beijing. AP video journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tucker Carlson claimed in a Wednesday interview that a member of Congress told him lawmakers were briefed that President Donald Trump is announcing “war is coming” tonight.\n\nCarlson joined Andrew Napolitano on his Judging Freedom podcast on Wednesday where they discussed growing tensions with Venezuela over strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, as well as Trump’s address to the nation, scheduled for tonight.\n\n“Is Trump going to start a war in Venezuela?” Napolitano asked Carlson.\n\nAccording to Carlson, members of Congress were briefed on Trump’s plans, though he added he does not know the actual contents of Trump’s address.\n\n“Here’s what I know so far, which is that members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war is coming and it’ll be announced in the address to the nation tonight at nine o’clock by the president,” Carlson said. “Who knows, by the way, if that’ll actually happen.”\n\nThe former Fox News host claimed he was told about the briefing by a member of Congress that morning.\n\nNotably, Axios’s Marc Caputo, who is well-sourced inside the Trump White House, reacted to Carlson’s comments, saying, “My sources say this wasn’t briefed & this announcement isn’t happening at 9.”\n\nCarlson is opposed to military action in Venezuela, arguing it would be repeating foreign policy mistakes of the past.\n\n“There’s not been a regime change effort that’s benefitted the United States or the world in 80 years that I’m aware of,” he said.\n\nTrump has repeatedly accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of being at the head of a narco terrorist smuggling operation. Maduro’s election victory has long been contested, with U.S. and global officials casting doubt on the results.\n\n“The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping. For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION,” Trump announced this week.\n\nThe president has also set his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, responding to his criticism of recent boat strikes by warning him he could have “big problems” soon.\n\n“He’s gonna have himself some big problems if he doesn’t wise up,” Trump told reporters. “Did he say Colombia’s producing a lot of drugs? They have cocaine factories that they make cocaine, as you know, and they sell it right into the United States. So he better wise up or he’ll be next.”\n\nThe post ‘War is Coming’: Tucker Carlson Says a Member of Congress Told Him What Trump Is Announcing Tonight first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s government has ordered its Navy to escort ships carrying petroleum products from port, escalating the risk of a confrontation with the United States after President Trump ordered a “blockade” aimed at the country’s oil industry.\n\nSeveral ships sailed from the country’s east coast with a naval escort between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, according to three people familiar with the matter. The vessels departed just hours after Mr. Trump said he intended to blockade sanctioned oil tankers that do business with Venezuela.\n\nThe ships — transporting urea, petroleum coke and other oil-based products — left the Port of José bound for Asian markets, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The Venezuelan government imposed the military escort in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, they said.\n\nVessels traveling with the escort did not appear on a current list of U.S. sanctioned ships, making it unclear whether they could be subject to Mr. Trump’s blockade. Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he was focused on oil tankers that have violated U.S. trade sanctions.\n\nThe third person familiar with the matter, a U.S. official, said Washington was aware of escorts and was considering various courses of action, but declined to provide details.\n\nVenezuela’s state oil company, known as PDVSA, said in a statement on Wednesday that ships connected to its operations were continuing to sail “with full security, technical support and operational guarantees in legitimate exercise of their right to free navigation.”\n\nMr. Trump had announced on Tuesday evening that he was imposing a “total and complete blockade” of tankers to and from Venezuela that had violated U.S. trade sanctions. Roughly 40 percent of the tankers that have transported Venezuelan crude in recent years have been placed under U.S. sanctions, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials last week seized an Asia-bound sanctioned tanker carrying nearly two million barrels of Venezuelan crude, a major escalation of Mr. Trump’s standoff with Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, whose government derives the bulk of its revenues from oil exports.\n\nU.S. officials have said in private in recent days that additional tankers carrying Venezuelan oil may be seized, without providing additional details.\n\nMr. Maduro has reacted to the seizure with anger and vowed to keep the oil exports flowing at all cost, said one of the three people.\n\nNicholas Nehamas and Rebecca F.

    "title": "Trump Administration Aims to Strip More Foreign-Born Americans of Citizenship",
    "description": "An official with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it would prioritize “those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration plans to ramp up efforts to strip some naturalized Americans of their citizenship, according to internal guidance obtained by The New York Times, marking an aggressive new phase in President Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\nThe guidance, issued on Tuesday to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services field offices, asks that they “supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month” in the 2026 fiscal year. If the cases are successful, it would represent a massive escalation of denaturalization in the modern era, experts said. By comparison, between 2017 and this year to date, there had been just over 120 cases filed, according to the Justice Department.\n\nUnder federal law, people may be denaturalized only if they committed fraud while applying for citizenship, or in a few other narrow circumstances. But the Trump administration has shown a zeal for using every tool at its disposal to target legal and illegal immigrants, leading activists to warn that such a campaign could sweep up people who had made honest mistakes on their citizenship paperwork and sow fear among law-abiding Americans.\n\nThe guidance comes as Mr. Trump has spent much of this year closing loopholes in the immigration system and throwing up roadblocks for people seeking to enter and stay in the country. The sweeping campaign, which has gone further than purging the country of unlawful migrants, has included blocks on asylum at the southern border, a pause on asylum applications inside the United States, and a ban on entry for travelers from predominantly African and Middle Eastern nations. Officials say their actions will make the country safer and preserve the country’s values\n\nA targeted campaign to increase the number of American immigrants stripped of their citizenship represents an escalation of an already ambitious campaign.\n\n“It’s no secret that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ war on fraud includes prioritizing those who’ve unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship — especially under the previous administration,” said Matthew J. Tragesser, a U.S.C.I.S. spokesman. “We will pursue denaturalization proceedings for those individuals lying or misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”\n\nIn interviews, some former agency officials expressed concern at the scale of the case goals for denaturalization pushed by U.S.C.I.S. leadership.\n\n“Imposing arbitrary numerical targets on denaturalization cases risks politicizing citizenship revocation,” said Sarah Pierce, a former U.S.C.I.S. official. “And requiring monthly quotas that are 10 times higher than the total annual number of denaturalizations in recent years turns a serious and rare tool into a blunt instrument and fuels unnecessary fear and uncertainty for the millions of naturalized Americans.”\n\nProponents of stricter immigration laws said it was necessary to more aggressively root out people who had been improperly granted citizenship.\n\n“I don’t think we’re anywhere close to denaturalizing too many people,” said Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors restrictive immigration policies. Mr. Krikorian said that the country was “so far from denaturalizing” enough people that such an effort would not pull in people who should not be targeted.\n\nThere are about 26 million naturalized Americans in the country, according to the Census Bureau. More than 800,000 new citizens were sworn in last year, most of whom were born in Mexico, India, the Philippines, the Dominican Republic or Vietnam, U.S.C.I.S. statistics show. Most people stripped of their citizenship revert to being legal permanent residents.\n\nThe new guidance on Tuesday was part of a document laying out U.S.C.I.S. priorities for the 2026 fiscal year, which began in October. Listed alongside such goals as “provide employee feedback opportunities” and “strengthen management of high-risk cases” was “pursue denaturalization.”\n\nThe Justice Department previously also said it would make denaturalization a priority this year. In a memo distributed in the summer, officials laid out their approach, saying they would target individuals in an array of categories beyond committing fraud in obtaining citizenship. Categories of eligible people include gang members, those who committed financial fraud, individuals connected to drug cartels and violent criminals, according to the department.\n\n“The civil division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,” the agency wrote in June.\n\nU.S.C.I.S. is a key player in the process of denaturalization. The agency refers cases to the Justice Department, which must go through a federal court to strip someone of their citizenship. The process can occur either through a civil or a criminal proceeding. During a civil case, government lawyers must have “unequivocal evidence” that someone obtained citizenship illegally or hid a material fact during the process.\n\nBecause the government must go through a challenging court process, denaturalization cases have been rare since the 1990s. A Bloomberg Law analysis found that denaturalization cases brought by the government since then peaked in 2018, when 90 criminal and civil cases were filed. “The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that citizenship and naturalization are too precious and fundamental to our democracy for the government to take it away on their whim. Instead of wasting resources digging through Americans’ files, U.S.C.I.S. should do its job of processing applications, as Congress mandated,” said Amanda Baran, a former senior U.S.C.I.S. official in the Biden administration.\n\nMr. Trump stepped up denaturalizations in his first term as well. In one widely publicized case, a New Jersey man born in India, Baljinder Singh, was stripped of his citizenship after the Justice Department found that he had arrived in the country without travel documents or proof of identity and that he had used a different name.\n\nThis year, the Justice Department has brought 13 denaturalization cases and won eight of them, according to Chad Gilmartin, an agency spokesman. Mr. Gilmartin said in a social media post earlier this year that there had been over 100 cases filed to the courts during the first Trump administration, compared with 24 during the Biden administration. In 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must prove not only that someone had lied during the citizenship application process but that the lie had an impact on the underlying citizenship claim.\n\nExperts said that despite the ramp-up in referrals, the process to actually denaturalize someone would likely remain quite difficult, raising questions on whether the government will actually be able to get many cases through.\n\nStill, some had concerns about what the guidance could portend.\n\n“My fear would be that as we have seen in the arrest and removal context when D.H.S. employees are given arbitrary targets what happens is people who shouldn’t be swept up, get swept up and that you’re going to see that happening to people in this context as well,” said Margy O’Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy organization. “That could incite fear and terror amongst naturalized citizens.”",

    "fullText": "Crypto markets were already on edge heading into President Donald Trump’s 9 PM EST primetime address to the nation from the White House.\n\nOnchain analysts spotted a large Ethereum move into Binance — the kind of transfer traders often associate with potential selling pressure, even when intentions are unclear.\n\nTrump said he would deliver “an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,” in a Truth Social post on Dec. 16.\n\nThe president did not specify a topic for the address, leaving markets to price in uncertainty ahead of the broadcast.\n\nFor crypto traders, high-profile political speeches can act like sudden volatility triggers, not necessarily because of direct crypto policy, but because they can shift expectations around the dollar, rates, risk appetite and market regulation.\n\nThat dynamic can lead some participants to cut leverage or reduce exposure ahead of time.\n\nOn Dec. 17, hours before Trump's 9 p.m. address to the nation, blockchain analytics account Lookonchain reported that a whale wallet “fully exited 10,169 $ETH ($29.7M)” and claimed:\n\n“Over the past 3 years, the whale has made a total profit of $11.36M trading $ETH.”\n\nThe post linked to Arkham Intelligence, where the address page shows a transfer of 10,169 ETH to a Binance deposit destination in recent activity.\n\nAt the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,014, up 1.8% in a day. Bitcoin was trading at $90,051, up 2.51% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLeaked memo shows popular crypto firm may wind down\n\nBitcoin, XRP slide as traders brace for key U.S. data\n\nAnalyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution\n\nLarge holders - often called “crypto whales” - can influence liquidity and short-term price action simply by moving size, especially around major headline events.\n\nIn practice, traders tend to read whale deposits to exchanges as a potentially bearish signal (possible selling), while withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as more bullish (potential long-term holding).\n\nBut those signals can be noisy: whales also move funds for custody changes, collateral management, OTC settlement, or strategic rotation.\n\nWith Trump’s address set for 9 p.m. ET, traders will likely watch two things closely: whether more large wallets send crypto to exchanges in the hours before the speech, and whether derivatives markets show signs of rapid deleveraging.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration intends to increase its efforts to strip some naturalized Americans ​of their U.S. citizenship, the New York Times ‌reported on Wednesday, citing internal guidance.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ‌guidance, which was issued on Tuesday, asks its field offices to \"supply Office of Immigration Litigation with 100-200 denaturalization cases per month\" in the upcoming 2026 fiscal year, according to the ⁠newspaper.\n\nThat would mark ‌a dramatic increase in denaturalization cases, which, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, stood ‍at about 11 per year between 1990 and 2017.\n\nUnder U.S. law, a person can be denaturalized for several reasons, including illegally ​gaining U.S. citizenship and misrepresenting a material fact during ‌the naturalization process.\n\nThe timeline for denaturalization cases varies, but they can take years to resolve.\n\nA USCIS spokesperson said it was not a secret that the agency's \"war on fraud\" prioritized people who unlawfully obtained U.S. citizenship, particularly under the ⁠previous administration.\n\n\"We will pursue denaturalization ​proceedings for those individuals lying or ​misrepresenting themselves during the naturalization process,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has carried out an ‍aggressive immigration agenda, ⁠including imposing travel bans and an attempt to end birthright citizenship, since January.\n\nHis administration most recently paused ⁠immigration applications, including green card and U.S. citizenship processing, filed by ‌immigrants from 19 non-European countries.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump will deliver a live national address from the White House tonight at 9 p.m. EST.\n\n“I look forward to ‘seeing’ you then,” Trump said on Tuesday in a Truth Social post. “It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!”\n\nSpeaking later that day to Fox News’ “America Reports,“ White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump would be discussing “all of his historic accomplishments over the past year, and maybe teasing some policy that will be coming in the new year, as well.”\n\nHere’s what to know about Trump’s unexpected primetime address.\n\nLeavitt said that it’s “going to be a really good speech.”\n\n“He’s going to talk a lot about the accomplishments over the past 11 months,” Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday. “All that he’s done to bring our country back to greatness and all he continues to plan to do to continue delivering for the American people over the next three years.”\n\nTrump’s primetime address comes as the president faces troubling polling numbers on key issues, including the affordability crisis, rising health care costs and an escalating conflict with Venezuela.\n\nAs the first year of his second term draws to a close, only 36% of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the economy, according to the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.\n\nTrump’s hardline immigration policies have drawn similar opposition from voters. According to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 38% of Americans approved of how he was handling immigration, down from 49% in March.\n\nThe AP-NORC poll also found that 68% of Americans believe the economy is in “poor shape,” including 44% of Republicans.\n\nTrump has delivered conflicting messages on the economy. He has referred to affordability as a “con job” and a “Democrat hoax,” while also blaming the Biden administration for inflation and high prices.\n\nAs the Supreme Court considers whether Trump’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs are legal, the president has touted a new “golden age” for Americans driven by his signature economic policy.\n\n“You’re going to see results in six months to a year,” Trump said last Sunday. “I think you’ll see results. We’ve never had anything like it.”\n\n.@PressSec Karoline Leavitt: \"President Trump is going to be giving an address to the nation tomorrow night...it's going to be a really good speech.

    "fullText": "Commons committee monitoring revolving door that gave jobs to George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Tony Blair\n\nWhen the billionaire chief executive of AI chipmaker Nvidia threw a party in central London for Donald Trump’s state visit in September, the power imbalance between Silicon Valley and British politicians was vividly exposed.\n\nJensen Huang hastened to the stage after meetings at Chequers and rallied his hundreds of guests to cheer on the power of AI. In front of a huge Nvidia logo, he urged the venture capitalists before him to herald “a new industrial revolution”, announced billions of pounds in AI investments and, like Willy Wonka handing out golden tickets, singled out some lucky recipients in the room.\n\n“If you want to get rich, this is where you want to be,” he declared.\n\nBut his biggest party trick was a surprise guest waiting in the wings. At Huang’s cue, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, walked out as the crowd whooped at Huang’s pulling power.\n\nStarmer, looking slightly dazed, saluted his host’s “absolutely phenomenal” presentation, told the audience about how he had been “texting away” with Huang and effusively thanked one of the world’s richest men for his “confidence in what we are doing, in your investment, your foresight”. Huang sent him away with a gift: an inscribed AI processing unit.\n\nNot done, Huang called on to the stage Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, followed by Peter Kyle, the secretary of state for business. The parade of British cabinet ministers at this private Nvidia event spoke volumes about how successfully US tech oligarchs have pulled British politicians – serving and former – into their orbit.\n\nThis week, they landed another big fish. The $500bn Chat GPT maker Open AI hired the former chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne, prompting him to gush he was joining “the most exciting and promising company in the world”.\n\nHe was just the latest senior figure to pass through the revolving door between Westminster and Silicon Valley. In October, the former Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak took advisory roles with Anthropic, one of OpenAI’s main rivals, and with Microsoft, which has invested heavily in both AI startups. Liam Booth-Smith, Sunak’s chief of staff, who sits in the House of Lords, also this summer took a senior role at Anthropic after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government.\n\nThey followed the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who spent seven years leading public affairs for Mark Zuckerberg at Meta, which runs Instagram and Facebook. Clegg is now an AI investor who last week predicted “we will move from staring at the internet to living in the internet”. He made tens of millions of dollars at Meta. Some reports said as much as $100m. He would not confirm that but said he was paid “extremely well”.\n\nMeanwhile, Tony Blair, prime minister for a decade until 2007, is becoming increasingly influential on technology policy, lobbying successfully, through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI), for the UK to introduce a digital ID.\n\nTBI is part-funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive of Oracle. A former TBI policy expert, Kirsty Innes, recently became a special adviser to Kendall.\n\nThe Commons science, innovation and technology select committee is monitoring the revolving door situation. Alex Sobel MP, a member of parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which is currently investigating AI, said: “I am deeply concerned tech companies may be using their huge buying power to water down much-needed regulation by hiring those who have served at the highest level of previous governments.”\n\nJobs with the biggest US AI companies can be a good fit for frontline politicians because they also require comfort with risk-taking, said one tech company insider. Another advantage is that tech leaders do not tend to demand polished management skills. Meanwhile, their value is growing as AI companies increasingly target their products at government clients as well as businesses and consumers. Osborne’s task appears to be to wedge his foot in the door of governments to help OpenAI to inject its technology into the bloodstream of public systems. It already has government-level arrangements with Argentina, Australia, Germany, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, the UK, Greece, Estonia and Kazakhstan, but it wants more.\n\nSelling state-level AI is competitive. Palantir, which hosted Starmer at its Washington base in February and signed a strategic partnership with the Ministry of Defence in September, is pushing its systems into health trusts, police forces and local councils in Britain. The company’s UK communications are being led by a former head of strategic communications at Downing Street.\n\nBritain is an important place for AI firms to gain influence: regulations on AI development remain looser than in the EU, its universities foster important innovations, and the UK also has one of the world’s most respected AI safety institutes.\n\nThe revolving door also spins the other way, sending tech industry people into positions of public influence. The UK government last month appointed Raia Hadsell, the vice-president of research at Google DeepMind, as an “AI ambassador”, alongside Tom Blomfield the founder of the online bank Monzo. Blomfield is also a partner at Y Combinator, the San Francisco start-up incubator that used to be led by Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI.\n\nCivil servants from the government’s digital service set up a consultancy called Public Digital, which has since won millions of pounds worth of public contracts. One of its partners, Emily Middleton, last year took a senior director general role in the government’s digital service.",

The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "description": "Trump’s AI “Manhattan Project” will fail if DOGE cuts are kept, critics say.",
    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.\n\nThe move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPeople who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.\n\nAt the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.\n\nAn additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.\n\nThe Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.\n\nIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.\n\nThe Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.\n\nThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.\n\n“This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAdvocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That’s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.\n\nNo One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was “deeply concerned” about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.\n\n“Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nCountries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the “utmost seriousness and urgency” and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the “matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.\n\nThe Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.\n\nThe new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several “U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.” The administration also said the recent war in those areas had “likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n\nAnika Kentish in Saint John’s, Antigua, contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

I should do it for less. I will do it for less. But just in case, I say 400. Otherwise if I go $3 over, the press will say, ‘It cost more.’ I build under budget and ahead of schedule … always. I know how to build under budget. I build good.”\n\n“It’ll be the most beautiful ballroom,” Trump added. “And it’ll handle inaugurations. It’s got 5-inch-thick glass windows. It’s impenetrable by anything but a howitzer. It’s impenetrable. But I will say, if I’m up making a speech one day and I hear, ‘Ding, ding, ding,’ I’m out of there.”\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and T-Mobile have all pledged money for the project. See the full list of donors here. Critics, however, have asked who will finance the maintenance of the venue once it is finished, which is due to be in the summer of 2028.\n\nTrump: $400 million… It will be the most beautiful ballroom and it will handle inaugurations.

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles calling him a conspiracy theorist in a recent Vanity Fair story.",
    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles calling him a “conspiracy theorist” in an explosive new Vanity Fair story.\n\nThe political world was rocked by Wiles’s explosive tell-all with the outlet. In it, she referred to Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought as a “right-wing absolute zealot,” claimed that President Donald Trump had “an alcoholic’s personality,” and even denied Trump’s previous claims that former President Bill Clinton visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.\n\nWiles also called Vance’s support for Trump “sort of political,” and added that the vice president had been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”\n\nHours after the story went live, Vance was at an event in Pennsylvania to speak about the economy. When it was opened up to questions, Vance was asked for his thoughts on Wiles’s characterization of him. The vice president said:\n\nI haven’t looked at the article. I, of course, have heard about it. But, conspiracy theorist — sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true. And, by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time.\n\nFor example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask 3-year-olds at the height of the Covid pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. You know, I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job. And I believed in the conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was trying to throw his political opponents in jail rather than win an argument against his political opponents.\n\nSo, at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it, and that’s my understanding.\n\nQ: Susie Wiles referred to you as a \"conspiracy theorist\" and your transformation into a Trump supporter as \"an act of political expediency.\" Your response?\n\nJD VANCE: Sometimes I am in conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true pic.twitter.com/ySghDjMgDz\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nAlthough Vance downplayed the article, he later suggested the White House will make themselves less accessible to mainstream media outlets because of it.\n\n“And the last thing I’ll say is if any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance continued, “I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews mainstream media outlets.”\n\nJD Vance: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope it's that we should be giving fewer interview to mainstream media outlets\" pic.twitter.com/6d8LoEIXWD\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nHe also reaffirmed his support for Wiles, stating that he had never seen her be disloyal to the president.\n\nVANCE: I've seen so many people who will say one thing to the president's face and then will do the exact opposite behind the scenes–\n\nGUY IN CROWD: They're traitors!\n\nVANCE: They are.

    "description": "The president said he is weighing an executive order on the issue.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reiterated that he is “very strongly” weighing an executive order that would reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he is looking into the move, adding that “a lot of people want to see” it happen.\n\n“It leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “So, we are looking at that very strongly.”\n\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The classification puts the drug on the same level as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the White House is weighing whether to list marijuana instead as Schedule III, which is defined as “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” Examples include Tylenol mixed with codeine, ketamine and testosterone.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll from October 2024, 69% of registered voters back reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category, including 51% of Trump supporters and 86% of supporters of former Vice President Kamala Harris. A Morning Consult poll from August found that roughly three in five voters, or 61%, support reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug under federal law.\n\nTrump’s statement follows his broad declaration of support for changing federal policy on the drug while on the 2024 campaign trail. Two months before the election, he said he intended to vote in favor of an amendment that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration also proposed moving the drug to the Schedule III category, though it did not come to fruition by the end of his term. Last year, the Justice Department recommended shifting cannabis to Schedule III, which prompted a formal review by the DEA.\n\nTrump’s announcement drew reactions from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n“Praying that somehow President Trump does not go forward with [this],” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) told NewsNation on Monday that “I think rescheduling marijuana is wrong.”\n\n“The fact is, marijuana is a gateway drug,” Lawler said. “Most of the people who end up using hard substances start out on marijuana.”\n\nWhile Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) previously urged Trump to loosen restrictions on marijuana, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the president “will try to gaslight everyone into believing he just made pot legal.”\n\n“He has not decriminalized cannabis or expunged the records of black and Latino Americans stuck in prison for minor drug offenses,” Wyden wrote on X. “This is just an attempt to boost his pathetic approval ratings.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump met privately last week with marijuana industry executives, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to discuss a plan on relaxing some federal restrictions on the drug. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) joined via a phone call, the outlet first reported.",
