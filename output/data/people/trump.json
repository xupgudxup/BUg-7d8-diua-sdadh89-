    "fullText": "On Jan. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred ruling on the litigation challenging President Donald Trump's global tariffs\n\nThe new date for the next ruling is set for Jan. 14.\n\nWhen Trump announced sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs targeting countries across the world on Apr. 2, 2025, a day he dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" he invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe administration had argued that trade deficits constituted a national emergency and the president didn't need to consult with Congress to levy global tariffs.\n\nSeveral businesses affected by the decision and 12 U.S. states, mostly Democratic-governed, then went to the Supreme Court to challenge Trump's tariffs.\n\nIf the court rules that the president was wrong in invoking the emergency powers, the Trump administration will have to reimburse importers who already have paid the duties. The reimbursement is estimated to be more than $133.5 billion as per a Reuters report.\n\nBut the administration could get away with only limited repayments if the court decides to grant limited powers to the president under IEEPA.\n\nThe court's decision carries far-reaching implications for not only the global economy but also the crypto market.\n\nThe digital assets market got increasingly tied to Wall Street last year and Trump's tariff announcements frequently rattled the markets throughout 2025.\n\nIn fact, it was Trump's threat to hike tariffs on China on Oct. 10 last year that triggered the crypto flash crash in which more than $19 billion got wiped out in a day.\n\nWealthy trader moves millions ahead of Trump’s ‘big’ economic speech\n\nMysterious trader bets millions ahead of the Fed’s big announcement\n\nMysterious traders are selling ahead of Trump's 9PM address to the nation\n\nAhead of key policy announcements, mysterious crypto traders often place market orders and net millions of dollars.\n\nAs reported earlier, a trader made millions by shorting cryptocurrencies ahead of Trump's China announcement on Oct. 10.\n\nRecently, a crypto trader on Polymarket profited over $400,000 by betting on Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro's ouster.\n\nNotably, the trader had created his Polymarket account only a day earlier, triggering speculations of insider trading.\n\nOnce again, a crypto whale placed an order as markets buzzed with reports of a Supreme Court ruling expected on Jan. 9.",

    "description": "In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that he would impose a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has taken another shot at big business, targeting banks this time.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said on Truth Social that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he added. \"Coincidentally, the January 20th date will coincide with the one year anniversary of the historic and very successful Trump Administration.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The president cannot unilaterally impose such a cap; it would require an act of Congress. Similar efforts that have been advanced in Congress have yet to become law.\n\nWhen contacted by Business Insider, representatives for Chase and Citi pointed to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America. The statement said that the trade organizations \"share the President's goal of helping Americans access more affordable credit.\"\n\n\"At the same time, evidence shows that a 10% interest rate cap would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help,\" the joint statement read. \"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives.\"\n\nTrump's announcement came hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders posted a jab against the president on X for not yet having introduced a proposal to cap credit card interest — a pledge Trump made during his 2024 reelection campaign.\n\n\"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder. Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards,\" Sanders wrote. \"The result? Last year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made $770 million. Unacceptable.\"\n\nIn the first few months of his second term, the Trump administration slashed funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the government agency responsible for protecting consumers by ensuring that financial markets are fair and competitive.\n\nTrump's announcement, made on Truth Social, is the latest in a series of swipes at big business the president has made this week.\n\nEarlier this week, he said that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments. He also said he was barring \"large institutional investors\" from buying up single-family homes and signed an executive order that would limit defense contractors' corporate spending.",

    "fullText": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina has repaid the funds it drew from a $20 billion credit line with the Trump administration, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Friday, in a crucial step for Argentine President Javier Milei to restore confidence in his chronically distressed economy.\n\nIn addition to making payments to bondholders, Milei’s radical libertarian administration had “quickly and fully repaid its limited draw,” Bessent said, without specifying the amount.\n\nThe Treasury’s latest report on the status of the credit line said that Argentina’s central bank had traded pesos for $2.5 billion through the swap as of the end of October.\n\nThe Argentine Central Bank confirmed Bessent's announcement.\n\nThe contentious and largely unprecedented U.S. rescue provided dollar liquidity to the Trump administration's cash-strapped ideological ally and halted a market rout in Argentina ahead of crucial midterm elections last October.\n\nMilei’s libertarian party won a major victory in the vote, cementing support for his harsh austerity program and quelling investor concerns about the crisis-stricken country's ability to repay debts. In another sign of the revived optimism around Milei's reforms, his government issued a dollar bond for the first time in eight years last month, presaging a return to international bond markets.\n\nThanks to Argentina’s deposit, Bessent said, the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund tapped for the bailout holds no more Argentine pesos.\n\nHe praised the payment as a landmark that justified the Treasury’s bailout of Argentina, which raised doubts about the consistency of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy and drew backlash in the U.S. for putting taxpayer funds at risk. Experts have also criticized the opaque and apparently unconditional nature of the loan.\n\n“Stabilizing a strong American ally – and making tens of millions in profit for Americans – is an America First homerun deal,” Bessent wrote. “Setting the course for Latin America, a strong and stable Argentina that helps anchor a prosperous Western Hemisphere is in our clear best interest.”\n\nLuis Caputo, Argentina’s economy minister thanked the Trump administration “for the trust in our economic policy.”\n\n“It is an excellent reality for our country to have been able to build this geopolitical alliance and to know that we have the explicit support of the most important country in the world,” he said.\n\nBut Argentina is not out of the woods.\n\nIts foreign exchange reserves still run perilously low. The country is set to come under further strain in the coming months from repayments on previous International Monetary Fund loans and other private debt.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A judge’s ruling that a Trump administration prosecutor in upstate New York was serving unlawfully has spilled into another case — with the same judge saying he can’t obtain tax return information in a criminal investigation because he lacks authority.\n\nThe ruling Thursday against prosecutor John Sarcone from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield came the same day the judge disqualified Sarcone from overseeing investigations into Democratic New York Attorney General Letitia James. In that case, Schofield ruled that Sarcone was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York and that any “of his past or future acts taken in that capacity are void or voidable.”\n\nSarcone is among the prosecutors around the country found by federal judges to lack authority after the Republican administration used unusual maneuvers to place them or keep them in their posts without U.S. Senate confirmation.\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor of law at the University of Richmond, said Schofield's ruling was consistent with previous decisions.\n\n“It does seem like more and more courts are coming around to this view,” he said.\n\nIn a separate ruling Thursday, Schofield denied Sarcone's application for a court order directing the IRS to disclose tax return information for a limited liability company as part of a criminal investigation. The application remains sealed and it's not clear who filed the tax returns sought in the Oct. 2 request.\n\nApplications for that tax information can only be made by officials holding specific positions, such as U.S. attorneys. The Manhattan judge said Sarcone lacked authority to authorize the application because he was not lawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney — mirroring her reasoning in the case involving James.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to the northern district.\n\nCourts in New Jersey, Nevada and California have held that similarly installed acting U.S. attorneys lacked lawful authority. Trump’s former personal attorney, Alina Habba,resigned as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey in December after an appeals court said she had been serving unlawfully.",

    "description": "\"What are you saying here, Marco?\" the president asked the bashful secretary of state after reading his letter in front of reporters",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump read aloud a private note from Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a Jan. 9 press conference at the White House\n\nTrump, who was meeting with oil and gas executives, read Rubio's instruction to \"go back to Chevron\" in front of the whole room\n\nHowever, the president didn't seem to fully comprehend Rubio's instruction\n\nPresident Donald Trump appeared to embarrass Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a press conference when he read aloud a private note from him on live television.\n\nTrump, 79, was taking part in a meeting with oil and gas executives at the White House on Friday, Jan. 9, when the incident occurred.\n\nThe president was seated between Vice President JD Vance and Rubio, 54, during the press conference. After Trump called on Ryan Lance of ConocoPhillips to speak, Rubio could be seen passing a handwritten note to Trump while Vance, 41, seemed to look on with confusion.\n\n\"Marco just gave me a note,\" Trump told the room of executives. Rubio capped his pen and glanced down, but as the president began reading the note aloud, he immediately looked at him.\n\n\"Go back to Chevron,\" Trump read from Rubio's note. \"They want to discuss something. Go back to Chevron.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Vance was clearly amused, laughing on one side of the president as Rubio smiled in apparent discomfort on the other.\n\n\"Go ahead, I'm going back to Chevron,\" Trump said as he placed the note back down on the table.\n\nHe then patted Rubio on the back as he told him, \"Thank you, Marco.\"\n\n\"Was there a question, Mr. President?\" a voice off camera could be heard asking Trump, who then picked up the paper again as he said, \"Yes, go ahead,\" before asking, \"Marco, what was the, what are you saying here?\"\n\nSecretary of energy Chris Wright then took over, asking Mark Nelson of Chevron to share updates from the company. As Nelson spoke, Rubio took the note back and folded it up before tucking it away.\n\nRubio also made headlines in the fall for another note written to Trump, which he gave the president during an Oct. 8, 2025 meeting with conservative influencers and the press.\n\nThe contents of the note, which were captured by photographers in the room, told Trump he needed to approve a statement on social media about a tentative peace agreement between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRubio signaled for Trump's attention during the meeting before sharing the private update with the president concerning the need for him to \"approve\" a social media post, suggesting Trump hadn't written the post himself.\n\nA photo captured by The Associated Press revealed the message, which read: “You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.” Trump quickly told meeting attendees that he had good news.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” he said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”\n\nAP reported at the time that Trump continued the meeting for 10 more minutes before telling the group he had to \"try and solve some problems in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"Although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows,” he continued. “We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that.\"",

    "description": "Big investors own a small fraction of America's single-family homes. But they're big players in certain Sun Belt markets. Trump wants to ban them.",
    "fullText": "Industry watchers on both sides of the aisle say President Donald Trump's recently announced goal of banning \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes won't address the root cause of high home prices: a shortage of homes.\n\nMajor investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, own hundreds of thousands of single-family homes around the US, which has raised concerns that Wall Street-backed groups are outcompeting individual homebuyers, especially first-time buyers, and driving up home prices.\n\nThese mega landlords own only a tiny fraction of the overall US housing market, although they control a significantly larger share of single-family rental homes in certain markets, particularly in the Sun Belt. Studies have found that they may have contributed to increased home prices and rents in certain areas.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, large investors bought thousands of distressed properties, particularly in Southeastern cities. They correctly predicted that home values and rents in many of the targeted areas would rise over time with population growth.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, and interest rates dropped, investors again snapped up thousands of homes, particularly in cities across the South and Sun Belt. This sparked alarm in communities where individual homebuyers struggled to compete with all-cash offers from major investors.\n\nOverall, large investors own only about 2% of the single-family rental housing stock, according to a 2024 analysis by the GAO. And since 2022, large investors have slowed their purchasing as interest rates have spiked and home prices have remained high. Some major investors have shifted their business model to buying homes in bulk directly from homebuilders, rather than purchasing them one by one.\n\n\"You're seeing this huge increase in debt costs to buy a home, and rents have softened mostly or been flat, and then with prospects of potentially declining home prices, or at least flat home prices, it's just tough,\" said Glenn Hull, CEO of SFR Analytics, which provides software and data tools to real estate investors and others.\n\nInstitutional investors have tended to cluster their purchases, resulting in more concentrated investments in certain neighborhoods in a handful of markets, including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Houston, Charlotte, and Tampa. The 2024 GAO report found that they own 25% of single-family rental homes in Atlanta and 21% of those in Jacksonville. Researchers have found that mega landlords may have contributed to the rise in housing costs, particularly in areas where they're heavily concentrated.\n\n\"The studies reviewed by GAO indicate that institutional investment may increase rents and home prices, particularly in places with high rates of institutional ownership,\" the GAO report said. It added that there are some indications that big investors are more likely to file evictions.\n\nStill, the evidence isn't particularly strong that big investors charge more than smaller landlords, or that they outcompete other buyers.\n\n\"It is unclear whether institutional investors crowd out individual home buyers, and evidence about whether they behave differently than other landlords is thin,\" a 2023 report by the Brookings Institution found.\n\nTo the extent that mega landlords are hurting affordability, it's a local problem in the most affected neighborhoods, industry watchers say.\n\n\"It's not a national story,\" said Jason Lewris, cofounder of Parcl Labs, which tracks institutional investors in housing. \"If you look within those markets, it's a handful of zip codes.\"\n\nMuch remains unknown about what kind of ban Trump intends to pursue. The administration hasn't defined \"large\" institutional investor. Trump said he would ban these investors \"from buying more single-family homes,\" but it's not clear whether they would also be required to sell their current portfolios.\n\nA White House spokesman, Davis Ingle, said in an emailed statement, \"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply, and lowering costs.\"\n\nTrump's proposed ban is part of a recent White House effort to address housing affordability concerns. The president announced on Thursday that he's directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds in an attempt to bring down mortgage interest rates.\n\nHousing economists say that banning major investors from buying additional homes would do little to improve affordability.\n\n\"Targeting a small subset of landlords without addressing underlying market conditions and policy gaps will not meaningfully improve the well-being of renters and prospective homebuyers,\" Jenny Schuetz, a former senior fellow focused on housing at the Brookings Institution, told the House Financial Services Committee during a 2022 hearing on corporate investors in residential real estate.\n\nSchuetz, in an interview with Business Insider, called Trump's proposed ban a \"red herring\" that \"distracts attention from things that actually could be helpful in improving affordability and increasing supply.\"\n\nThat's in part because investors don't change the demand for or supply of housing.\n\n\"The housing demand is the same regardless of whether a household rents or buys a home, and housing supply is the same regardless of whether a landlord supplies the unit or a household owns it,\" researchers at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a 2024 report in which they called institutional investors a \"scapegoat\" that distracts from the supply shortage driving higher prices.\n\n\"Periods of rapid rent increases correspond to periods of greater household formation coupled with supply shortages, not institutional investor buyers,\" they added. \"It is hard to argue that institutional rental operators drive up home prices over any reasonable period.\"\n\nInstead, economists argue that an undersupply of homes is the major underlying reason for rising prices.\n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin.\n\nMom-and-pop landlords and other smaller investors own the vast majority of single-family rentals in the US. Stopping a large investor from buying a home doesn't necessarily mean a first-time homebuyer or other individual would end up purchasing the house, Fairweather said. Instead, many of these homes would be snapped up by the main competitors of big investors: smaller landlords.\n\nFrom the tenant's perspective, having a mom-and-pop landlord isn't necessarily better than renting a home from a large investor. And when it comes to enforcing laws that protect tenants, including fair housing laws, it can be easier to prove a pattern of behavior by larger landlords, Fairweather said.\n\nIf the federal government succeeds in passing a ban, enforcing it could be tricky. Large investors could break themselves up into smaller shell companies to avoid the prohibition, Lewris said.\n\nThere are other ways to stop investors from buying up more homes that could be more effective. One alternative is to discourage the behavior by raising property taxes on homes owned by institutional investors, thereby making the practice less lucrative, Hull and Fairweather said.\n\n\"In general, bans don't really work, because people find a way around them,\" Fairweather said, \"but if you tax something, at least you get tax revenue out of it that could be used to support things like first-time homebuyer programs or building more affordable housing.\"\n\nInvestors often argue that they actually boost quality housing options for lower-income people by offering rentals in neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes. Tenants tend to have far lower incomes and wealth than homebuyers. And the neighborhoods dominated by single-family homes often have attractive amenities, including good schools and jobs.\n\n\"The narrative today is that what my business does is wrong, that buying homes and renting them is a bad thing because I'm keeping people from buying homes,\" Sean Dobson, CEO of Amherst, a single-family rental company heavily invested in the Sun Belt, said at the real estate conference ResiDay in November 2025. \"It couldn't be any further from the truth, but it's a powerful message.\"\n\nInstead, he argued, his firm helps its tenants live in homes that they couldn't afford a down payment for or wouldn't qualify for a mortgage to buy.\n\nFairweather agreed that banning large landlords from owning single-family homes would mean fewer tenants could live in these wealthier neighborhoods. \"In a way, it boxes out renters and exacerbates some of the inequalities that exist in the country,\" she said.\n\nMadison Hoff contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Here's how Trump's plan to load up on mortgage bonds could impact housing affordability",
    "description": "Trump's plan has already pushed mortgage rates down, but industry experts say they're skeptical of a long-term impact on housing affordability.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump this week has zeroed in on an issue that's at the heart of America's affordability crisis: housing costs.\n\nBut it's not clear if his latest proposal, which involves instructing his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities, will move the needle for the housing market in the long run, economists and analysts told Business Insider.\n\nThe mortgage-bond purchasing plan, which Trump announced on Truth Social Thursday night, is a lot to grapple with for people unfamiliar with the mortgage market. But the logic behind how this could make buying a home easier goes something like this:\n\nThe plan could have a quantitative easing-like impact on the market, Oliver Allen, a senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told Business Insider. QE refers to the Fed's bond-buying program aimed at adding liquidity to the debt market and stimulating economic activity by encouraging more borrowing. However, the Fed has generally undertaken QE in times of economic turmoil, while Trump is piling into mortgage bonds while the economy is doing pretty well.\n\nThe president's plan has already moved mortgage rates. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropped from 6.21% to 5.99% on Friday morning, according to Mortgage News Daily. That's the lowest level in about three years, and experts are optimistic that rates could fall further.\n\nZelman & Associates, a boutique housing research firm, estimated that mortgage rates could fall slightly below 6% under the new MBS purchasing plan, down from its most recent mortgage rate forecast of 6.2% for 2026.\n\nJoel Berner, a senior economist at Realtor.com, estimated that the purchasing plan could drive mortgage rates as much as 50 basis points.\n\nBut the move might be a one-time drop, and the plan may not alter the picture for housing affordability in the long run, Berner and Allen said.\n\nIt's unclear what Trump meant when he said he told his \"representatives\" to purchase $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities. The timing and mechanism behind the bond purchases also remain unclear, Zelman & Associates wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nIt's also murky how much of a difference $200 billion will make in the $9 trillion MBS market, analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday. The Fed, for reference, has around $2 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, Realtor.com's Berner said.\n\nThe MBS market is the largest and most liquid in the world after US Treasurys, and buyers are plentiful. Purchasing around 2% of the total outstanding value of bonds in the market might amount to a drop in the bucket a far as impact.\n\n\"Without that same level of scale and credibility, any impact on mortgage rates would likely be modest and short-lived,\" Berner wrote.\n\n\"I don't think this policy on its own can really do very much,\" Allen said.\n\nWhile borrowing costs have been a barrier to homebuyers in recent years, the real issue is supply. A lack of available homes has been the key constraint to truly making housing affordable for more Americans, Berner said. By some estimates, the US is short 5 million homes, or 3.7% of the current supply.\n\nShould rates come down without an increase in housing inventory, that could actually worsen affordability by intensifying competition in the housing market and causing home prices to rise.\n\n\"The long-term real impact is on the supply side. So this demand boost might help in the short run, might boost sales activity, potentially might boost prices or stabilize prices at least, but we don't really see this as a long-run solution,\" Berner told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think even if you can nudge down mortgage rates at the margin, you're still going to have very high home prices and very stretched affordability as a result,\" Allen said.\n\nTaken along with Trump's ban on large investors buying single-family homes, the MBS plan shows that the administration is keenly aware that affordability is an issue for many Americans—and a potential political liability as the midterms approach.\n\nHousing has been a crucial focus for Trump all throughout his second term, but the president's zeal for making housing cheaper appears to have picked up as campaign season approaches, Allen noted.\n\n\"They're throwing a lot of darts at the board right now,\" Berner said, referring to the president's other initiatives, like introducing a 50-year mortgage and banning big investors from purchasing homes. \"I think they're just trying to pull out all the stops.\"",

    "description": "The president uses digital media to get his message across — but he really loves old media like newspapers and cable TV.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, Donald Trump filed a $15 billion defamation suit against The New York Times. That suit is still ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sat down with Times reporters at the White House for a 2-hour interview, where he expounded on his worldview, conducted an off-the-record conversation with the president of Colombia, and showed off new plans to renovate the West Wing.\n\nIf that surprises you, it shouldn't. Trump, and the rest of his administration, love to complain about the Times and other big, mainstream media outfits. They also love talking to them.\n\nEarlier this week, for instance, key Trump advisor Stephen Miller appeared on CNN for a much-discussed interview with Jake Tapper, where he laid out a bellicose view of America's role in the world.\n\nA few days before that, Trump talked to The Wall Street Journal — another publication he's currently suing — for a story about his health and fitness.\n\nAnd last month Vanity Fair published a lengthy profile of Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff, which involved multiple interviews with Wiles and portraits of her and other Trump officials, including Miller, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nTrump has made mainstream media a target since he started running for president in 2015, calling reports he doesn't like \"fake news,\" and labeling journalists \"enemies of the people.\" He's called for a change in US libel law, so he can more easily punish journalists, and he often insists that TV networks that irk him should have their broadcast licenses revoked.\n\nAnd his rhetoric and actions have ramped up in his second term, where he has banned the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office, stocked the White House briefing room with Trump-friendly outlets, and pushed out all mainstream reporters from the Pentagon.\n\nAll of that should worry anyone who cares about press freedom — or in less lofty terms, the ability of the press to accurately tell you what's happening in the federal government.\n\nThe flip of that is quite simple: Trump is a man who grew up in a world dominated by traditional media — newspapers and television — and he still cares very much about what traditional media says about him, no matter what he says. That's why he delights in constant press appearances in the White House, aboard Air Force One, and anywhere else reporters have cameras, microphones, and notepads.\n\nI often think of an AP photo from last spring, shortly after he'd announced his initial, chaotic tariff plan, that shows him perusing the New York Post's coverage of that plan in the back of his limousine. We focus a lot of attention on Trump's ability to use Twitter, YouTube, podcasts, and other digital media to shape public perception. But he's very much an old media guy — print, broadcast, cable.\n\nAnd as long as those things still exist, Trump will want to be in them and flattered by their coverage. Which explains why he can sue them and invite them into his office at the same time.",

    "description": ": Just refreshed to avoid 5G interference? Do it again, FAA tells industry, as Upper C-band auction looms",
    "fullText": "Airlines operating in the US may have to upgrade their aircraft radio altimeters again at a cost of billions of dollars, to avoid potential interference with cell networks following the Trump administration's decision last year to auction off additional spectrum to bidders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a notice of proposed new regulations. If implemented, these will require all radio altimeters to meet specific minimum performance requirements.\n\nThose requirements are for altimeters to able to withstand interference from wireless signals in neighboring spectrum bands, while continuing to provide accurate altitude readings to both pilots and integrated aircraft safety systems.\n\nAnd the cost for all this? The FAA estimates the total bill to retrofit aircraft with interference-tolerant altimeters will be $4.49 billion, or $424 million annualized at a 7 percent discount rate over 20 years.\n\nAccording to the FAA, the blame for this move lies with the Trump administration and its US budget bill signed into law last year that directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to open up more radio frequencies to be auctioned off for commercial use.\n\nThis sell-off must include at least 100 MHz and possibly as much as 180 MHz of the 3.98 to 4.2 GHz band (Upper C-band), which the FCC intends to make available for terrestrial wireless flexible use, as disclosed in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [PDF] last year.\n\nHowever, aircraft radio altimeter (RA) systems operate in the adjacent 4.2 to 4.4-GHz band, and the FAA is clearly worried about the possibility of interference if cellular network operators start using the Upper C-band to deliver services.\n\n\"FAA expects future wireless services in the Upper C-band aligned with service rules in the Lower C-band to cause interference to current RA systems. Existing RA systems are not compatible with this envisioned use, and airworthiness directives issued by FAA in 2023 are insufficient to address the unsafe condition that will result from wireless services in the Upper C-band,\" the agency says in its proposal document.\n\nWireless service providers have already taken voluntary measures in the proximity of airports, the FAA says, but these commitments will hit a sunset date at the start of 2028 unless extended by mutual agreement, and long-term compatibility between Lower C-band wireless services and RA systems has not been resolved beyond that date.\n\nIt believes that a single retrofit of RA systems will be able to address compatibility issues with wireless services in both the Lower and Upper C-band, and says the aviation industry has been working to develop standards for next-generation RA systems for several years now.\n\nThe deadline for making these changes is proposed to coincide with the FCC's date authorizing the initiation of new wireless services in the Upper C-band, which the FAA currently expects to be sometime between 2029 and 2032.\n\nThis isn't the first time this issue has arisen. Back in 2021, The Register reported that the FAA was concerned enough to consider restricting flights once 5G services were up and running. European aviation regulators declared that this wasn't an issue on their side of the Atlantic, however.\n\nThe solution from the FAA back then was also to replace the affected RA systems, and the agency set a deadline of February 1, 2024 for all updates to be carried out. It later declared that, as of the end of September 2023, the entire US airline fleet had upgraded their equipment and the risk of 5G interference had been mitigated.\n\nUntil last year, of course, when the newly installed Trump administration decided to start re-allocating spectrum in order to generate more revenue from license fees.\n\nThe FAA's notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) document is open for comments for 60 days, a period that ends on March 9.\n\nA spokesperson for Airlines for America - a trade association for US passenger and cargo airlines - sent a statement to The Register:\n\n\"We have been working collaboratively with the telecommunications industry, the FAA and the FCC to identify solutions that ensure our nation's airspace remains safe while allowing the spectrum to be used.\n\n\"We were expecting this NPRM, which was published to fulfill requirements included in the One Big Beautiful Bill, and are currently evaluating all of the details in the proposal and will be providing comments.\"\n\nThe Reg also asked International Air Transport Association (IATA) for comment. ®",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's Secret Service code name is \"Mogul,\" and first lady Melania Trump's is \"Muse.\" Here's what other presidents have been called.",
    "fullText": "Secret Service code names, which Secret Service agents use when communicating about the security of the first family, are among the worst-kept secrets in Washington.\n\nThough they're meant to be secret, the code names quickly become public either through government filings, sources who leak them to news outlets, or when agents are overheard at public events. Since new technology has allowed security agents to monitor officials in a variety of ways, the names aren't so top-secret anymore.\n\nThe White House Communications Agency assigns each member of the first family a code name for Secret Service agents to use during their time in the White House. These names come from a list of agency-approved choices that either the president chooses from or agents pick.\n\nOther members of the family are then assigned names that share the same first letter. Sometimes, it's the same letter as the family's last name, but not always.\n\nHere are the Secret Service code names used by the past 12 presidents and first ladies.\n\nKennedy's code name harkens back to Lancelot, one of King Arthur's heroic Knights of the Round Table. After his death, Jacqueline Kennedy popularized the moniker \"Camelot\" in reference to his presidency.\n\nJacqueline Kennedy's code name was fitting for her image as one of the most elegant residents in the history of the White House, who wore lace for her high-profile wedding and during events like a widely covered state visit to France.\n\nJohnson kept the same Secret Service code name that he used as Kennedy's vice president.\n\nLady Bird Johnson was a woman of many names. Her birth name was Claudia Alta Taylor, but a nursemaid nicknamed her Lady Bird, according to the White House Historical Association. To the Secret Service, she was known as Victoria.\n\nNixon's given code name adds an ironic tinge to his legacy in the context of the night raid that set off the Watergate scandal and led to his resignation.\n\nPat Nixon chose the code name \"Starlight,\" corresponding to her husband's choice of \"Searchlight.\"\n\nFord used the same Secret Service code name when he served as vice president under Nixon.\n\nA pinafore is a type of women's dress, but Betty Ford famously wore pants while dancing on top of the Cabinet Room table on her last day as first lady in 1977.\n\nCarter's open devotion to his Christian faith made this codename spot-on. After his retirement from politics, Carter even spent time teaching Sunday school.\n\nRosalynn Carter also used the code name \"Lotus Petal.\"\n\nThe former actor had appeared as a cowboy on-screen, but Reagan's passion for all things Western also shaped his image as president.\n\nThe code name \"Rainbow\" was a nod to Nancy Reagan's affinity for wearing bright colors.\n\nSome of Bush's Secret Service agents served as pallbearers at his funeral in 2018, AP reported.\n\nAfter her death, former Secret Service agent Jonathan Wackrow wrote for CNN that her code name \"exemplified her demeanor and its calming, humanizing and gentle effect on those around her.\"\n\nThough he never reached the rank of Eagle during his time as a Boy Scout, Clinton was given the patriotic code name.\n\nHillary Clinton's codename used during the 2016 presidential election was the same security code name that she had during her time in the White House.\n\nBush originally used the code name \"Tumbler\" when his father was president. It was changed to \"Trailblazer\" when he became president.\n\nThe Bushes' twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, went by the code names \"Turquoise\" and Twinkle.\"\n\nThough the name matched the bold optimism of Obama's campaign, the president reportedly just chose his favorite from an approved list of proposed words that started with the letter \"r.\"\n\nThe Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, were known as \"Radiance\" and \"Rosebud.\"\n\nBiden's Secret Service code name served as a tribute to his Irish Catholic heritage. He also used the code name \"Celtic\" as vice president.\n\nJill Biden also kept her Secret Service code name from her time as second lady.\n\nThough he said in a 2015 candidate debate that he would choose the name \"Humble\" for himself, the one he was ultimately assigned was likely inspired by decades spent in a real-estate dynasty handed down from his father. Trump has used the same code name during both of his terms.\n\nIt's been suggested the first lady's name refers to her career in front of the camera as a model in New York City before she met her mogul husband.\n\nThe name of Melania Trump's production company, Muse Films, is a nod to her Secret Service code name. Muse Films will release the documentary \"MELANIA,\" which chronicles the lead-up to Trump's 2025 inauguration, on January 30.",

Prior to Friday's report, the totals for private and public sector jobs would not have been the same as the ones included in the chart.\n\nOn Friday morning, economists were able to connect the dots following the release of the December jobs report to the public.\n\nThe US added 50,000 jobs in December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly report. The increase was less than expected. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.4%.\n\nHistorically, presidents are briefed a day ahead of the report's publication. By protocol, the president and White House staff are not supposed to comment on the report until it is released.\n\nEconomist Justin Wolfers called the episode \"unprecedented.\"\n\n\"No White House has ever before leaked such important market-moving numbers,\" Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, wrote on X. \"No serious country does this.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nTrump had a similar episode during his first term. In 2018, Trump touted jobs numbers an hour before the report's release. Economists criticized the president at the time, though the White House said Trump had done nothing untoward.\n\n\"I don't think he gave anything away, incidentally,\" Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said in 2018. \"I think this is all according to routine, law, and custom.\"",

    "description": "The U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to issue its next rulings on January 14 as several major cases remain pending including the legality ​of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs.\n\nThe court indicated on its website on Friday that ‌it could release decisions in argued cases when the justices take the bench during a scheduled sitting next Wednesday. The court ‌does not announce in advance what cases will be decided.\n\nThe justices issued one ruling on Friday in a criminal case.\n\nThe challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to ⁠office in January 2025. The outcome ‌will also impact the global economy.\n\nDuring arguments in the case heard by the court on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the ‍legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.\n\nTrump has said tariffs have made the United ​States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ‌ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States.\n\nTrump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address what he called a national emergency related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl ⁠and illicit drugs into the United States as a national ​emergency.\n\nThe challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the ​Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed.\n\nOther important cases are also awaiting rulings at the court, which ‍has a 6-3 conservative majority, ⁠including a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 federal law enacted by Congress to prevent racial discrimination in voting.\n\nAnother involves a challenge on free ⁠speech grounds to a Colorado law banning psychotherapists from conducting \"conversion therapy\" that aims to change an LGBT minor's sexual orientation ‌or gender identity.",

    "description": "White House officials believe that Marjorie Taylor Greene may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Donald Trump's dinner plans last September.",
    "fullText": "White House officials believe that former congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the superfan-turned-intraparty foe of President Donald Trump, may have tipped off a far-left protest group about Trump’s dinner plans last September.\n\nAccording to Axios’s Alex Isenstadt, a “chaotic confrontation” between Code Pink protesters and Trump at Joe’s Seafood, a Washington, D.C., restaurant that Greene had recommended to the commander-in-chief, “embarrassed the president and intensified concerns in the White House about his safety.”\n\nOfficials told the Secret Service that they suspected that Greene may have informed Code Pink of Trump’s intention of dining at Joe’s that evening.\n\nPer Isenstadt, the White House’s theory relies on two pillars:\n\n1. Her suggesting where Trump should dine\n\nOfficials say that after recommending the president go to Joe’s, Greene repeatedly called White House staffers the day of the dinner to confirm he was going.\n\nAfter Trump heard about Greene’s calls, he called her shortly before leaving the White House and confirmed his planned visit, the sources said.\n\nGreene — who was a regular at the restaurant — didn’t show up there when Trump and other officials were there, which struck some Trump aides as odd.\n\n2. Greene’s relationship with Code Pink\n\nWhite House aides note Greene is friends with Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin.\n\nGreene and the organization are aligned in their opposition to the U.S. providing military aid to Ukraine and Israel.\n\nBenjamin last year praised Greene for opposing Trump’s bombing of nuclear sites in Iran and for calling to strip foreign aid from the Pentagon’s budget.\n\nBoth Greene and Code Pink denied the accusation. The former told Axios that the charge is “an absolute lie, a dangerous lie,” and insisted that while she recommended the establishment to Trump, she didn’t know when he might go.\n\n“That absolutely did not happen, to the point it is comical,” commented Code Pink’s Melissa Garriga.\n\nTrump criticized Greene in a November Oval Office Q&A after Greene broke with him on a number of hot-button issues.\n\n“Yeah, so I don’t know what happened to Marjorie. She’s a nice woman, but I don’t know what happened. She’s lost her way, I think,” said Trump at the time. “when somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’s now catering to the other side—I don’t know what, you know, I guess she’s got some kind of an act going—but I’m surprised at her. But when somebody like Marjorie goes over and starts making statements like that, it shows she doesn’t know.”\n\nThe feud only escalated from there.\n\nThe post White House Reportedly Suspects Marjorie Taylor Greene Tipped Off Left-Wing Protesters About Trump Dinner Plans first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "\"It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\"",
    "fullText": "As a neurologist, I care for some of society’s most vulnerable individuals — children with severe disabilities who are often mocked, dismissed or misunderstood. My career is rooted in supporting people with physical and cognitive differences, educating about empathy and respect for human diversity, and applying the principles of science and medicine to improve the lives of those facing challenges of one kind or another.\n\nFrom that perspective, President Donald Trump’s public admonition of a female reporter in November — “Quiet, piggy” — was gut-wrenching and continues to resonate weeks later. To some, it was an offhand, albeit misogynistic, fat-shaming insult. To me, the remark instantly evoked Piggy, the vulnerable and marginalized character in William Golding’s novel “Lord of the Flies” and revealed something far more troubling: a display of dominance, denigration and the subjugation of those deemed less worthy.\n\nAlso Read: After My Baby Died, I Saw 4 Words On A Standard Form At The Doctor's Office That Stopped Me Cold\n\nThe rapid spread of the phrase across media platforms underscored a deeper danger — one that has only grown more unsettling as public displays of intimidation and condemnation increase. It is not just the cruelty of the words but the authority of the speaker, and the delight of many in his audience, that makes them so corrosive.\n\nAs some media outlets bow to Trump, HuffPost won’t back down. We’re committed to relentlessly reporting on his actions and holding power accountable every step of the way. Support fearless journalism — join our membership program today.\n\n“Quiet, piggy” is not a joke. It is an illustration of how normalized bullying has become, and an affront to the people I care for and the values that guide my work.\n\nOthers have drawn parallels between “Lord of the Flies” and our political moment. In 2020, The New York Times published Jennifer Finney Boylan’s essay “President of the Flies,” in which she described feeling cast onto “some cruel and hostile strand ... where people with disabilities were mocked, immigrants ... were reviled, and grabbing women by their private parts was ... A-OK.”\n\nHealth: Therapists Warn This Normalized Trump Behavior Is Causing Real-World Harm\n\nBoylan compared the “Flies” boys’ descent into savagery with a society in which democratic norms erode, expertise is dismissed and cruelty is sanctioned. Her metaphor captured profound moral decay and warned of the danger of unchecked power divorced from reason, science and shared truth.\n\nYet even as Boylan wrote, darker chapters still lay ahead: the attack on the U.S. Capitol; the dismantling of asylum protections; and the normalization of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics stripping primarily people of color of due process. What began as boasts about grabbing women’s bodies metastasized into a broader posture of possession — an expanding sense of what can be seized without consequence: democratic institutions, marginalized populations beyond our borders and — most recently — entire territories and nations framed as objects to be claimed. Golding captured this descent in “Lord of the Flies,” where casual cruelty gradually hardens into loss of restraint and hunger for control.\n\nThese events raise a troubling question: What has become of a society that greets such assertions of entitlement with indifference — or even approval? When the targets are distant, vulnerable or politically inconvenient, outrage seems to dissipate. Increasingly, the United States feels less like a democratic exemplar than a cautionary tale of how quickly ethical bearings can be lost.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, Piggy is intelligent, physically fragile and socially marginalized. He is mocked — and ultimately killed — for the very qualities that make him indispensable. When his glasses, the symbol of knowledge and reason, are shattered, civilization collapses into savagery.\n\nLife: We Asked Actual Historians About Trump's New Plaques — And They Have THOUGHTS\n\nThe parallels today are difficult to ignore. Scientific expertise is ridiculed. Anti-vaccine rhetoric is elevated. Universities are portrayed as threats. Books are banned, history sanitized and facts themselves rendered suspect. Like Piggy’s broken glasses, our collective means of illumination is being smashed.\n\nAs a physician, I see the consequences of this erosion. Public health experts are harassed. Families distrust lifesaving medical advice. Vulnerable children absorb a cultural message that intellect and difference make them contemptible. What makes this moment especially dangerous is not merely who initiates the cruelty but who echoes it.\n\nIn “Lord of the Flies,” it is not Jack, the overt villain, who says “Quiet, Piggy,” but Ralph, the boy aligned with order and conscience. This is the moral creep Boylan warned about: the moment when those who believe themselves principled begin to accommodate degradation. That is what made the aftermath of this remark so disturbing. Piggy memes spread widely — not only among Trump supporters, but among critics and political leaders who claim to reject his politics. The very behaviors we teach children to avoid — mockery, humiliation, ridicule — have become entertainment, modeled by adults in positions of authority.\n\nThis casual embrace of cruelty — and the willingness to look away as acts of intimidation, coercion and lawlessness accumulate — reveals something deeper. “Quiet, piggy” conveys that bullying is acceptable, vulnerability is shameful, intellect is unwelcome and force — not dialogue — is the currency of public life. It is not a passing insult but an alarm bell, reverberating against barriers I have spent my career trying to overcome.\n\nAlso Read: My Parents Wanted To Adopt More Kids — After I Started Having My Own. Here's What I Didn't Expect To Feel.\n\nIn Golding’s novel, the Beast is an imagined external threat, but it is Simon who speaks the most unsettling truth before he, too, is murdered: “Maybe there is a beast. Maybe it’s only us.”\n\nThe greatest danger is not a single leader, but a collective moral drift — a human capacity for dehumanization when norms collapse. Leaders do not invent this darkness; they unlock it.\n\nWe are not innocent bystanders. History shows where dehumanization leads — not through lone tyrants, but through ordinary people who acclimate to the erosion of decency. Like Golding’s boys, we have shown ourselves willing to normalize cruelty, relish humiliation and allow the expanding reach of those in power to go unchallenged. We cannot reclaim innocence, but as professionals, parents, educators and voters, we can resist the further unraveling of our civic soul.\n\nAlso Read: What’s The Secret To A Longer Life?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, don’t spend much time together, but they apparently connect over a shared interest.\n\nIn a People article published on Wednesday, January 7, a source told the outlet that beyond the couple’s joint public appearances, “There is little interaction between them, just what is expected,” noting afterward, “they go back to doing their own thing.”\n\nHowever, the source revealed the Commander-in-Chief, 79, and the First Lady, 55 — who wed in 2005 and share son Barron Trump, 19 — both have a passion for interior design.\n\n“Donald has his own vision for his homes and clubs, and over the years has designed and selected a lot of the furnishings and finishings himself at Mar-a-Lago and the golf clubs,” the source explained. “He and Melania have that in common. They both love interior design.”\n\nWhite House spokesman Davis Ingle responded to People’s reporting, telling the publication: “President Trump and the entire administration work 24/7 for the American people to deliver on the promise to Make America Great Again. The Trump Family is the most successful family of all time.”\n\nThe billionaire has seemingly put his interest in interior design into action, as he’s demolished the White House’s East Wing and is now building a multi-million-dollar, 90,000-square-foot ballroom.\n\nRep.

    "description": "Industry insiders say Trump's call to ban big investors is out of sync with how those players actually buy homes.",
    "fullText": "Trump's pledge to upend Wall Street's 15-year push into the market for single-family American homes raised alarms across the real estate investment industry — and skepticism.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about it,\" said Todd Henderson, the head of real estate for the Americas at DWS, an investment firm that has purchased single-family rental homes.\n\nWhile details of Trump's proposal are unknown, Henderson expects that it will eventually exclude institutional buyers who have purchased newly built homes, which have become the focus of much of the single-family rental (SFR) industry.\n\n\"The fear is that large investors are buying single-family homes and that it's taking out of the sales pool and driving up the cost of housing — that's what is driving this discussion,\" Henderson said. \"We're building this stuff and adding it to supply.\"\n\nIn a message on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump said that he was \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nSome analysts, however, suggested that that view was out of step with the institutional SFR industry's contemporary business model, which has shifted away from the inefficient — and politically sensitive practice — of competing against everyday homebuyers to scoop up properties one by one.\n\nInvitation Homes, a public company that is one of the largest owners of SFR homes, \"has almost exclusively moved to acquiring homes from homebuilders rather than on the MLS,\" according to a research note from RBC.\n\n\"AMH's external growth comes from development rather than acquisitions,\" Barclays wrote in a report, referring to American Homes 4 Rent, another large SFR owner.\n\nTrump's announcement caused shares of Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent to fall by about 7% and 9% respectively, according to KBW.\n\nOther major investors, including Blackstone, also saw an impact on share prices. Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, a non-trade REIT managed by the firm, holds about $11 billion worth of SFR investments totaling about 9% of its portfolio.\n\nJade Rahmani, an analyst at KBW, wrote that the market reaction \"seems excessive and could present a buying opportunity\" in a Wednesday report on the potential ban.\n\nDetails were scant about how Trump's prohibition on Wall Street homebuying would work.\n\nTrump said that he would be \"calling on Congress to codify it\" and that he would \"discuss this topic\" during \"my speech in Davos in two weeks.\"\n\nTrump has walked back policies, such as his tariffs, due to disruptions to the economy and investor concerns.\n\nThe likely need for congressional approval could insert more complexity — and uncertainty — over the process of formalizing an SFR ban.\n\nA Mizuho report said that Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno had proposed a bill to codify Trump's SFR ban, but that it \"doesn't believe\" it will progress \"anytime soon.\"\n\nHenderson said he believes that any rules imposed on the SFR industry would exempt both builders and buyers of new SFR homes and would allow major investors to sell existing portfolios freely. Such caveats would leave the SFR industry basically unchanged.\n\n\"I think it will increase the value of the purpose-built SFR homes and make that strategy even more valuable,\" Henderson said.\n\nThe SFR industry has pointed out that its investors own a comparatively small share of the roughly 80 million single-family homes in the country.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors who own 10 residential units or more held about 3.4% of all single-family homes, and that larger investors with at least 1,000 units controlled just 0.73% of the inventory.\n\n\"Professional single-family housing providers represent a small segment of the overall housing market, and the single-family rental industry remains focused on supporting renters while also supporting pathways to homeownership,\" said a spokeswoman for National Rental Home Council, an industry group that represents SFR owners.",

    "title": "The TUNA trade has stirred up a wild week for defense stocks after Trump's latest flurry",
    "description": "All it took was a pledge for $1.5 trillion in military spending to spark a reversal in the sector.",
    "fullText": "The \"TACO trade,\" short for Trump Always Chickens Out, was one of the great market memes of 2025. Whenever the market would throw a tantrum about a Trump policy — usually related to tariffs — the president would reverse course to stem the bleeding.\n\nA similar story has played out this week within US defense stocks, with a few unique twists. Here's the minute-by-minute recap from Wednesday afternoon:\n\nIt was that last statement, 2 hours and 9 minutes after Trump's first post about defense companies, that sparked a rally in those exact same defense stocks on Thursday. The optimism of a huge spending increase had offset the initial sting of industry criticism.\n\nIt wasn't a precise TACO trade situation. It was closer to something I'd like to coin as the TUNA trade: Trump Usually Negates Announcements. The president didn't outright reverse a prior statement. He countered a bearish opinion with something bullish that counterbalanced it. There's a big difference!\n\nThe volatile episode leaves questions unanswered about the future of the industry. The knee-jerk reaction from investors was to buy/sell first, then ask questions later. What does the longer term look like?\n\nWall Street analysts generally support the idea that the additional military spending will offset any new capital restrictions.\n\n\"The changes are significant but not necessarily draconian,\" said JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman. A \"potential budget increase would support sustained growth, taking some sting out of the executive order.\"\n\nKen Herbert, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, says large-cap defense companies will feel the squeeze more than their defense-tech counterparts, which he sees outperforming.\n\n\"Defense primes will look to de-risk major program investments by securing long-term purchase agreements, where possible,\" he added.\n\nJefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu called Trump's comments an \"overreach\" and said that they catalyzed something that was already bound to happen.\n\n\"The industry has been clear that it is ready to invest on clearer demand signals,\" she said.\n\nFrom a demand perspective, $1.5 trillion in 2027 sounds quite appealing. If all goes according to plan — and that's a big \"if\" — more stock gains could be in store for defense companies.",

    "title": "Trump has a China problem in Venezuela: What to do with Beijing's debt and oil stakes",
    "description": "When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words.  After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — When it comes to claiming that Venezuelan oil is now under his control, President Donald Trump is mincing no words. But no small part of that oil belongs to China under contracts it struck with Caracas years ago, setting the stage for a delicate diplomatic dance in the next few weeks.\n\nSome experts expect Trump to work with China in an effort to stabilize trade relations. After all, Trump is expected to visit Beijing in April as part of an effort to protect the fragile trade truce he reached with Chinese President Xi Jinping late last year.\n\n“The administration appears focused on avoiding unnecessary escalation or new irritants with Beijing while keeping leverage firmly on Washington’s terms,” said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nHe added that he doubted Trump would risk turning Venezuela into a “flashpoint that complicates trade dynamics or Trump’s personal engagement with Xi.”\n\nChina is owed at least $10 billion from Venezuela, according to various estimates, a debt that former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had paid down by shipping oil to China. It is possible that the interim Venezuelan government complying with Washington’s demands could question the legality of those loans-for-oil deals and cease payments.\n\nTwo major Chinese state-owned enterprises — China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec — are entitled to 4.4 billion barrels of oil reserves in Venezuela, the highest for any foreign country, according to a research note by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nU.S. companies also have claims for tens of billions of dollars from when Caracas nationalized the oil industry, and it’s not clear how these IOUs will be honored and in what order.\n\nThe U.S. seized two sanctioned oil tankers this week as part of a plan to assert control over Venezuelan oil shipments. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. will handle the sales of Venezuela’s oil “indefinitely,” depositing proceeds into U.S.-controlled accounts that will ultimately “flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThe administration said this week that the U.S. would kickstart those sales with 30 million to 50 million barrels taken from the South American country’s crude storage facilities. Asked for more detail, a Trump administration official not authorized to comment publicly and speaking on condition of anonymity said U.S. policy was to wind down “adversarial outside influence” in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe U.S. using such leverage over a crucial natural resource comes after Beijing flexed its muscles last year by choking off critical supplies of rare-earth magnets and weaponizing its purchase of American soybeans in the trade war with Washington. When Trump met Xi in South Korea in October, the two men agreed to a one-year truce, backing off from sky-high tariffs and export controls on each other.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, Venezuela was the fourth-largest recipient of Beijing's official credit, having received $106 billion worth of loans from China’s official-sector creditors, according to AidData, a research lab at Virginia's College of William & Mary that tracks Beijing's overseas lending activities. But how much of the total that Caracas has paid off and what is still owed is unclear, said AidData executive director Brad Parks, because Caracas stopped reporting debt details several years ago.\n\nWhile some estimates put the outstanding debt at $10 billion, Parks said the figure could be much higher because U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil might have delayed loan repayments. The loans from China, under an unusual arrangement, were set up to be paid down with proceeds from oil exports.\n\nIn China, the capture of Maduro evoked memories of another leader who had struck deals with Chinese companies and then suddenly lost power: Libya's Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nAfter the 2011 fall of Gadhafi, Chinese businesses had to leave behind billions in investments. Cui Shoujun, professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Chinese news and commentary site guancha.cn that the transition government in Caracas could deem agreements under Maduro unlawful and the debt to China illegal.\n\nAs in Libya, Beijing’s stakes in Venezuela have gone beyond oil. Chinese firms have invested in telecommunications, railways and ports in Venezuela, all now at risk, according to a report by the global financial firm Jefferies.\n\nStill, the firm noted that Beijing will likely manage any disruption because Venezuelan oil counted for only a small percentage of China's oil imports and because Beijing has diversified its energy supplies and pivoted to electrification.\n\nHours before he was captured by U.S. forces, Maduro hosted a high-level Chinese diplomat at the presidential palace and praised the countries' ties that had prospered from the days of his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, and given Beijing a strong foothold in America's backyard.\n\nVenezuela is the only Latin American country that has a high-level strategic partnership with China, on par with close friends like Pakistan, and the ouster of Maduro is expected to curtail China's influence in the Western Hemisphere — in line with one of the goals spelled out in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy.\n\nBeijing's response to the capture of Maduro\n\nSoon after Maduro was captured, Beijing said it was “deeply shocked” by the blatant use of U.S. force against a sovereign state and action against its president and said it “strongly” condemned the U.S. actions. It called for the immediate release of Maduro and his wife.\n\nChinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said Thursday that no nation has the right to interfere with economic and trade cooperation between China and Venezuela, which he said is between two sovereign states and protected by international and domestic laws.\n\n“No matter how the political situation in Venezuela evolves, China’s willingness to deepen bilateral economic and trade cooperation will not change,” He said.\n\nSingleton said Beijing does not wield the clout in the Western Hemisphere as touted.\n\n“Beijing can protest diplomatically,” he said, “but it cannot protect partners or assets once Washington decides to apply direct pressure.”",

    "description": "The Treasury Secretary said that Trump's proposal to keep big players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell current holdings.",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that President Donald Trump's proposal to keep Wall Street players from buying single-family homes would not force them to sell their current holdings.\n\n\"These big institutions buy housing, then rent them out, and they're able to depreciate it. They hide their earnings, pay lower taxes,\" he said on Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota.\n\n\"The idea here is bygones are bygones,\" Bessent added. \"We're not going to have a forced sale here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he would ban institutional investors from purchasing single-family homes in an effort to make housing more affordable for Americans. Single-family homes refer to standalone residential buildings with their own entrance designed for one household.\n\n\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream,\" Trump wrote on a Truth Social post. \"That American dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.\"\n\nShares of asset manager Blackstone fell 5.6% on Wednesday after Trump's post. Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, oversees one of the largest rental housing portfolios in the US, with several hundred thousand single-family homes and apartments. Other stocks similarly fell.\n\nCritics say firms like New York-based Blackstone put pressure on the housing market, reducing the availability of homes and driving prices up. Blackstone closed 1.1% higher at the end of the trading day on Thursday.\n\nThe institutional players, meanwhile, say lack of housing supply — not big-business ownership — is pushing prices up.\n\nIn Minnesota on Thursday, Bessent said that the administration has not decided on the \"exact contours\" of this new proposal.\n\n\"We want to keep the traditional mom and pop owners in. We want to keep families who rent out to their other family members,\" he said.\n\nBessent said that this practice of large firms buying up single-family homes started during the 2008 financial crisis, when private equity companies were among the few parties with the money to buy these homes.\n\n\"They hoovered up the single-family housing stock,\" he said.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office found that in 2022, the five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of single-family rental homes.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration believes you don't have the right to record Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in public. This stance is both factually wrong and an attempt to chill free speech by conflating it with violence.\n\nAt a July 2025 press conference in Tampa, Florida, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"Violence is anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations, encouraging other people to come and to throw things, rocks, bottles.\"\n\nIn September 2025, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin called \"videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online\" a form of doxing. She added, \"We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nThese aren't idle threats. The Trump administration strong-armed Apple into removing an app from its mobile store that tracked ICE activity and threatened criminal investigations into its creators.\n\nThe most aggressive application of this policy has come in Chicago under \"Operation Midway Blitz,\" where ICE officers have relentlessly targeted protesters, reporters, and clergy engaged in protected First Amendment activity.\n\nIn October, a group of journalists and protesters filed a lawsuit alleging \"a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians.\"\n\nIn court filings, the plaintiffs stated that federal officials' own testimony illustrated their point. For example, when ICE field director Russell Hott was asked if he agreed \"that it's unconstitutional to arrest people for being opposed to Midway Blitz,\" he answered \"No.\"\n\n\"Similarly, [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Greg] Bovino testified that he has instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations, even though such statements—which do not constitute true threats—are protected speech,\" the motion argued. (Hott and Bovino's depositions were filed under seal, and those comments were later redacted in a corrected filing by the lawsuit plaintiffs, but not before others took screenshots of them.)\n\nBased on voluminous evidence that feds in Chicago ignored her previous orders to curb their use of force, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction against DHS in early November 2025, saying the government's conduct \"shocked the conscience.\"\n\nEllis found much of the officials' testimony not credible. Bovino, for instance, testified that he never used force against a protester he was filmed tackling, and in another instance, Ellis said, he lied about being hit with a rock before firing tear gas at demonstrators. Nor did evidence support the government's claims that federal officers issued warnings before firing less-than-lethal projectiles at those protesters.\n\n\"Describing rapid response networks and neighborhood moms as professional agitators shows just how out of touch these agents are, and how extreme their views are,\" said Ellis.\n\nThe Trump administration responded by calling Ellis an \"activist judge,\" but it is squarely wrong when it comes to recording and protesting the police. Cato Institute senior fellow Walter Olson points out that, \"While the Supreme Court itself hasn't yet faced the issue squarely, the seven federal circuits that have done so…all agree that the First Amendment protects the right to record police performing their duties in public.\"\n\nLikewise, federal circuits have upheld the right to use vulgar language to oppose police without fear of retaliation, and to warn others of nearby police checkpoints or speed traps.\n\nAs Olson writes, the administration's \"attempt to alter reality by establishing new legal facts on the ground\" ultimately serves as a green light for informal repression. \"If the agents come to believe that they have blanket immunity [for] whatever they do, or that citizens have no right to record them, they are more likely to take aggressive informal action, such as grabbing phones or taking news reporters into custody on charges of obstruction (perhaps later quietly dropped).\"\n\nIt's not hard to find examples of this rotten agency culture in practice. In late October 2025, ICE officers broke out the window of a U.S. citizen's car and detained her for seven hours after she followed and photographed their unmarked vehicles. DHS accused her of reckless driving, attempting to block in officers with her car, and resisting arrest—all claims that she and her lawyer deny. Prosecutors did not charge the woman with a crime.\n\nRecording government agents is one of the few tools citizens have to hold state power accountable. Any attempt to redefine observation as \"violence\" is not only unconstitutional—it's authoritarian gaslighting. When a government fears cameras more than crimes, it isn't protecting the rule of law. It's protecting itself.\n\nThe post The Trump Administration Says It's Illegal To Record Videos of ICE. Here's What the Law Says. appeared first on Reason.com.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he wants to block large institutions from buying single-family homes, arguing that housing should belong to people, not corporations.\n\nThe proposal lands as U.S. home prices and mortgage costs sit near record highs, keeping many first-time buyers locked out of the market.\n\nOne billionaire investor says the idea makes sense, even if the details are still unclear.\n\nIn a post shared on Jan. 7, President Donald Trump said he is “immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single family homes,” adding that he will push Congress to “codify it.”\n\nTrump framed the move as a response to affordability strain, writing that:\n\n“Buying and owning a home” was once “the pinnacle of the American Dream,” but is now “increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans.”\n\nU.S. housing data backs up the pressure.\n\nThe median price for an existing home hit a record high in 2025, while mortgage rates stayed above 6%, pushing monthly payments further out of reach for many first-time buyers.\n\nEven with sales volumes near historic lows, limited inventory and years of underbuilding have kept prices elevated, reinforcing the political appeal of targeting institutional demand.\n\nIn an exclusive response to TheStreet Roundtable, Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban said he supports the idea in principle.\n\n“I’m fine with it,” Cuban said, when asked about Trump’s proposal. “If it has some unintended consequences, they can always unwind it.”\n\nCuban’s reaction carries weight because he sits at the intersection of business, investing and policy debates. He has long argued that affordability issues are shaped by multiple forces, including insurance costs, supply constraints and local regulation.\n\nNew report reveals US may have sold Bitcoin despite Trump exec order\n\nU.S. housing crisis sparks boom in crypto-backed mortgages\n\nVenezuela could hold as much Bitcoin as Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy\n\nWhen pressed on what unintended consequences might look like, Cuban said they are hard to predict in advance.\n\n“Meaning you can’t anticipate everything,” he said, adding “I don’t know what they could be.”\n\nHis answer highlights both the appeal and the risk of blunt policy tools.\n\nWhile restricting large buyers could ease competition in some markets, it does not address the deeper shortage of homes that economists say is the main driver of high prices.",

    "description": "The president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more in a revealing new interview",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said that his only guardrail as he looks to obtain more global power is \"my own morality\"\n\nIn a new interview with The New York Times, he said he doesn't \"need international law\" to dictate his approach to foreign policy\n\nAlso in the interview, the president doubled down on his plans to take military action in Latin America, annex Greenland and more\n\nPresident Donald Trump is making it clear that he won't be constrained by the law as he continues teasing a takeover of the Western Hemisphere.\n\n“I don’t need international law,” Trump said in a new interview with The New York Times. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”\n\nWhen pressed further, the president said he understood that his administration would need to abide by international laws. However, he added, \"It depends what your definition of international law is.\"\n\nThere is, Trump insisted, just \"one thing\" that can curtail his desire for global supremacy: \"My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.\"\n\nThe interview comes less than a week after U.S. forces, under Trump's direction, captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, amid \"large-scale strikes\" on the capital city of Caracas, and brought them to the U.S. to stand trial on multiple charges related to narco terrorism.\n\nThough Venezuela has installed an interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump has stated many times that the United States is now in charge of running the independent nation.\n\n\"It's going to be run very judiciously, very fairly. And it's gonna make a lot of money,\" he previously said. \"You know they stole our oil. We built that whole industry and they just took it over like we were nothing. So we did something about it. We're late, but we did something about it.\"\n\nHe later added, \"We'll be selling large amounts of oil [from Venezuela] to other countries... We're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be.\"\n\n\"We're gonna make sure the people of Venezuela are taken care of... You're going to have peace, justice...you're going to have a real country.\"\n\nHe doesn't plan to stop there. The president is also fixated on his desire to annex Greenland, which is currently controlled by Denmark, a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nTrump admitted that \"it may be a choice\" to preserve the country's relationship with NATO versus taking over Greenland, an important trade crossroads between the U.S., Europe, China and Russia.\n\n“It’s so strategic right now. Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,” he said to reporters aboard Air Force One on Jan. 4. “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.”\n\nTo The New York Times, he insisted that it wasn't enough to have the country controlled by an ally — he wants exclusive, outright ownership.\n\n“Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also has his sights set on Colombia, Cuba, Iran and Mexico.\n\n\"You have to do something with Mexico. Mexico has to get their act together because they're pouring through Mexico and we're going to have to do something,\" he previously told reporters, referring to drug cartels in the country.\n\n\"We'd love Mexico to do it. They're capable of doing it, but unfortunately, the cartels are very strong in Mexico,\" Trump added.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nReferring to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, Trump said his country is being \"run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States, and he’s not going to be doing it very long.\"\n\nPetro spoke with the Times prior to calling Trump to discuss the threats, expressing his concern about the U.S. making a strike in Colombia, similar to the one in Venezuela.\n\n“We are in danger,” the Colombian president said. “Because the threat is real. It was made by Trump.”",

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Mike Pence has issued a dire warning that Donald Trump will be impeached if Democrats win this year’s midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking to CNN’s The Source with Kaitlan Collins, Pence said he agreed with Trump’s assessment that Democrats would find a “reason to impeach” should they retake control of the House, and possibly even the Senate, in November’s nationwide elections.\n\n“I think it’s very likely,” Pence said. “I mean, they impeached the president for a phone call when we were in office, and I expect it in this highly divided, partisan town.”\n\nPence’s relationship with Trump fell apart in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. In the weeks leading up to the riot, Trump repeatedly and falsely suggested that Pence had the power to refuse to certify the 2020 election results.\n\nHe then blamed Pence for the certification of Joe Biden’s win, leading to supporters directing their ire at the outgoing vice president during the Capitol riot with chants to “hang Mike Pence!”\n\nTrump later became the first U.S. president in history to be impeached for a second time after being accused of inciting the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTrump was first impeached in 2019 after allegedly threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was acquitted by the Senate both times.\n\nDemocrats are widely predicted to post significant victories in November’s midterms. Historically, the party in power suffers heavy losses—particularly in the House—and Trump’s turbulent second term, marked by a struggling economy, is expected to fuel voter backlash.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt warning about what could happen if the GOP loses control of the House.\n\n“You gotta win the midterms,” he said. “Because if we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be—I mean, they’ll find a reason to impeach me. I’ll get impeached.”\n\nDuring his appearance on CNN’s The Source, Pence also suggested that Trump’s attack on Venezuela without congressional approval—and the unprecedented capture of its former leader, Nicolás Maduro—could become a liability for the remainder of Trump’s time in the White House.\n\nThe former vice president added that Americans are now longing for a “return to those timeless principles and values that really united the country.”\n\n“The year that Ronald Reagan won 49 states, they were the very same principles that President Trump and I governed on,” Pence said. “And whatever time I have left remaining in the public debate, I’m going to continue to be a consistent advocate for that broad, mainstream conservative agenda.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Defense stocks pay relatively high dividends, but there are alternative areas of the market for investors to consider if they want steady income.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump sent defense stocks on a roller coaster ride this week, and his recent executive orders on defense firms and his calls for more defense spending could impact investors' portfolios.\n\nThe president signed an order aimed at restricting some financial behavior among defense contractors, including an executive order that bans defense firms from issuing dividend payments and doing stock buybacks until they deliver a \"superior product.\" Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that he wants the US military budget could raised to a record $1.5 trillion next year.\n\nBoth developments have implications for investors who have money in the defense sector, which is known for paying relatively high dividends. Lockheed Martin, for instance, has an annual dividend yield of around 2%, compared to about 1% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nHere's the rundown of how investors should be thinking about the latest news — and what it means for their portfolios.\n\nFor the most part, investors shouldn't be thinking about their long-term investments too differently. Trump's push to ban dividend payments seems largely hypothetical, and it's unclear how the president will enforce such a rule, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.\n\n\"It feels as though this was making another random social media announcement that will likely die on the vine,\" Hogan told Business Insider. \"I don't know you need to make a rush to judgment in terms of changing your long-term investment plans.\"\n\nBesides the threat of barring dividend payments, Trump's announcements on social media seem largely positive for defense investors, José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said. He added that those who aren't dependent on dividend payments should remain invested in the sector, pointing to the potential for growth.\n\n\"I think that investors can look forward to improved quality from those companies, in the best-case scenario,\" he told BI.\n\nIf defense companies fall in line and pause dividend payments, that could hurt investors who specifically hold dividend-paying stocks for regular income, Torres said.\n\nBut those investors can move to other dividend-paying areas of the market. Torres encouraged investors to consider value sectors with high dividend yields, such as energy and healthcare.\n\nB. Riley's Hogan encouraged investors to consider areas like energy, consumer staples, pharmaceuticals, utilities, and other parts of the industrial sector, a broader umbrella that covers defense stocks.\n\nDividend ETFs, which track a basket of dividend-paying companies, are also an option for investors chasing dividends, he added.\n\n\"There's a lot of dividend darlings for sure,\" Hogan said. \"I think investors, if in fact they feel nervous about the potential for dividend cuts or the removal of dividends in any space, as unlikely as that prospect seems, there are ways to navigate around that.\"\n\nInvestors should be watching their bond investments, Peter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said.\n\nBerezin said that the significant increase in defense spending could lead to a rise in bond yields, which would mean bond prices could fall.\n\nInteractive Brokers' Torres also said he believed bond investors should \"absolutely\" be concerned about the more robust military budget, which could raise long-end bond yields in particular.\n\nLong-end bond yields have climbed in recent years as concerns have risen about the US deficit and rising levels of government debt. Higher debt levels make investors more wary of purchasing long-term US Treasurys, which means yields need to rise to attract investors. Heavy borrowing and spending are also inflationary, which could push yields higher down the road as the central bank adjusts monetary policy to keep prices under control.\n\nTorres didn't recommend selling bonds at the moment. He believes concerns around debt have caused long-end bond yields in the US to be \"too high,\" and he expects those yields to ease soon.\n\n\"I'm a bond bull at this juncture,\" he said.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump took aim at defense contractors on Wednesday in an executive order.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is targeting the bank accounts of defense contractor CEOs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order outlining new rules for defense contractors that would ban stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget\" — as well as limit executive compensation.\n\nThe order stipulates that in future contracts, if the Secretary of War were unsatisfied with a company's performance, executive base salaries would be capped at current levels. Future contracts would also ensure compensation \"not be tied to short-term financial metrics\" and instead be \"linked to an on-time delivery, increased production, and all necessary facilitation of investments and operating improvements.\"\n\nThe goal, per the executive order, is to increase the speed of innovation at defense companies, rather than focus on corporate profits.\n\nTrump also took aim at the leaders of defense contractors in a series of posts on Truth Social on Wednesday.\n\n\"Executive Pay Packages in the Defense Industry are exorbitant and unjustifiable given how slowly these Companies are delivering vital Equipment to our Military,\" Trump wrote. \"Salaries, Stock Options, and every other form of Compensation are far too high for these Executives.\"\n\nHe proposed that no executive should earn \"in excess of $5 million\" until their production speed and maintenance improve, though the executive order did not cap pay at that exact amount.\n\nThe leaders of the big five defense contractors — Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly known as Raytheon), Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics — each earned more than $18 million in total compensation in 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. Their total income was a combination of salary, incentives, stock options, and other forms of compensation, including the value of security services and changes in the value of pension funds.\n\nWhile exceeding the $5 million cap proposed by Trump by magnitudes, the CEOs' compensation pales in comparison to that of some other business leaders.\n\nDozens of CEOs earned more than them in 2024. James Robert Anderson, who runs materials manufacturer Coherent, had a pay package of more than $100 million last year. The CEOs of Starbucks, GE, and Microsoft each made more than $75 million.\n\nExecutive pay and stock transactions are part of Trump's larger plans for the military. On Wednesday evening, he said on Truth Social that America's military budget should be increased to $1.5 trillion in 2027, up from the record 2026 defense budget of $901 billion.\n\nThat sent defense stocks climbing on Thursday morning, gaining back what they'd lost following the signing of the executive order.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider regarding the order, a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin said the company \"shares President Trump's and the Department of War's focus on speed, accountability, and results, and will continue to invest and innovate at scale to ensure our warfighters maintain a decisive advantage and are never sent into a fair fight.\"\n\nBoeing and General Dynamics declined to comment, and Northrop Grumman and RTX did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "description": "Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, aiming to lower interest rates and monthly payments.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is instructing \"representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, arguing the move would lower interest rates and monthly housing payments.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the directive was possible because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have \"$200 billion in cash.\" He added the bond purchases would help \"make the cost of owning a home more affordable.\"\n\nIt was not clear who Trump meant by his \"representatives,\" or which entity would carry out the purchases. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.\n\nTrump's proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump's latest proposal would have on the market.\n\nRichard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump's proposal doesn't go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren't enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.\n\nHowever, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.\n\n\"When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,\" Green said. \"And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.\"\n\n\"So it's not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you're going to make housing less or more affordable,\" Green added. \"But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it's not all that much.\"\n\nTrump's plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.\n\nThe approach fits with a broader shift in Trump's second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider's Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more interventionist style of capitalism, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.\n\nTrump's latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.\n\nHousing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. Zohran Mamdani, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge Tuesday ordered Trump ally Lindsey Halligan to explain why she continues to call herself the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia even though another judge determined in November that she had been unlawfully appointed to the position.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Novak of Richmond issued a three-page order demanding to know why Halligan is still serving in the post. Halligan, who unsuccessfully prosecuted former FBI Direct James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, is also referred to as U.S. attorney by the Justice Department in official documents.\n\nThe judge's order is unusual because he issued it on his own, not at the request of defense attorneys. It came in a case involving a carjacking and attempted bank robbery suspect who was indicted last month.\n\nNovak gave Halligan seven days to respond in writing “explaining the basis for ... identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie’s contrary ruling. She shall also set forth the reasons why this Court should not strike Ms. Halligan’s identification of herself as United States Attorney from the indictment in this matter.”\n\nThe judge’s order goes on to say Halligan \"shall further explain why her identification does not constitute a false or misleading statement.\" Novak also alluded to potential disciplinary action and demanded that Halligan sign her response.\n\nThe U.S. attorney’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.\n\nIn late November, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie found that the Justice Department had violated the Constitution by appointing Halligan as U.S. attorney. That finding led to the dismissal of criminal cases against Comey and James.\n\nCurrie ruled that all actions “flowing from Ms. Halligan’s defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey’s indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power.” She issued a separate, similar ruling in the James case, saying Halligan had exercised power she “did not lawfully possess.”\n\nNovak acknowledged Tuesday that the November ruling regarding Halligan’s appointment had been appealed but said that since the order had not been paused, it remains the “binding precedent of the district and is not subject to being ignored.”\n\nOther judges in the district have previously expressed their frustration with Halligan, including one who now places an asterisk next to Halligan’s name on every court document and next to it refers to Currie's ruling from November.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "title": "Exclusive-The Trump Administration killed a draft proposal to halve alcohol limits, sources say",
    "description": "Last spring, a group of officials from the U.S.",
    "fullText": "LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Last spring, a group of officials from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was drafting a proposal to halve the recommended limit for alcohol consumption for men to one drink a day, according to two former government sources and a document seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Alcohol is known to cause cancer,\" the health officials wrote in the draft version of their proposal reviewed by Reuters. The group was tasked with leading an update to alcohol advice in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the U.S. government's roadmap ​to healthy drinking and eating that influences school lunches, medical advice and other policies.\n\nThe draft proposal added that if both men and women had one or fewer drinks per day it could save thousands of U.S. lives per year. Advice for women would have remained the same at one drink per day.\n\n\"It ‌seemed clear to me that the cancer epidemiology suggested that there was an increased risk of breast cancer and head and neck cancer associated with less than one drink per day,” said David Berrigan, a former program director at the National Cancer Institute, an arm of the U.S. health department, who was part of the group that planned to recommend tightening the guidelines.\n\nBut the proposal never saw the light of day.\n\nOn Wednesday, ‌the Trump administration took the opposite tack, publishing new guidelines that give no advice at all on servings, instead just advising Americans to drink less for better health.\n\nThe change eliminates a recommendation in place for 35 years that men limit alcohol consumption to two drinks per day and women to one drink per day. It also followed a years-long lobbying campaign by the alcohol industry, worth some $1.2 trillion in global sales according to drinks market research firm IWSR, to disrupt the health officials' work.\n\nPublic health experts and researchers warned the change could lead to higher alcohol consumption and, ultimately, more alcohol-linked death and disease.\n\n“People will redefine that moderation around what it means to them and, obviously, that can be a very large range,” said Karen Hacker, who served as Director of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until 2025.\n\nIn a statement, HHS said its policies were driven by evidence and gold-standard science. “It is absurd to suggest that anything other than science guides our work on this presidential priority.”\n\nAt a White House press conference ⁠announcing the guidance on Wednesday, Mehmet Oz, celebrity physician and administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said that ‌alcohol should be consumed in small amounts. “Don’t have it for breakfast,” he said.\n\nThere was never good data supporting the prior guidance of two drinks per day for men and one for women, he continued.\n\nA White House official told Reuters it was clear from the new guidelines that the Trump Administration was not being influenced by industry, and added alcohol consumption was at a multi-decade low anyway.\n\nTrump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. do not drink and the Make America Healthy Again social movement aligned with them makes minimal reference to ‍alcohol, focusing its efforts on reducing childhood vaccinations, a position decried by major medical groups, and having fewer preservatives in food.\n\nThe International Alliance for Responsible Drinking, a group funded by leading brewers and spirits makers, says that drinking in moderation is low risk. Industry groups and companies either declined to comment, did not respond or said they wanted to ensure any changes to guidance were based on science.\n\nAndrew Langer, director of the Center for Regulatory Freedom at the Conservative Political Conference Foundation, called the new guidelines a “compromise position” between “the neo-temperance movement saying people should not drink anything at all and another group who says the U.S. government shouldn’t be making statements about alcohol.”\n\nHe said it would be “a little hypocritical and disingenuous” for the administration to take steps to loosen regulations on marijuana and ​psychedelics while implementing tighter policy on drinking.\n\nThe U.S. dietary guidelines are the focus of lobbying by the industries they impact, including everything from sugar, cattle and dairy to the wine, beer, and spirits industries.\n\nTop producers like Johnnie Walker whisky maker Diageo and Molson Coors, owner of Miller Lite, and their trade associations, started campaigning on the ‌2025-2030 guidelines at least as far back as 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Congress set aside $1.3 million for a study on the health effects of alcohol to be conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM), a congressionally chartered non-profit. Two former alcohol lobbyists said that the industry lobbied lawmakers for the study.\n\nFunding for the study was first proposed in a bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, a major production hub for Molson Coors, the second-largest brewer in the U.S.\n\nLobbying disclosures show lobbyists for Molson Coors and the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States petitioned lawmakers on Baldwin’s bill in 2022. The spirits industry body said in a statement it wanted to ensure alcohol guidance is grounded in “sound science - not opinion or ideology.”\n\nBaldwin’s office said the legislation was written with input from several lawmakers but that she stood by funding the study as “sound science necessary to inform public health guidelines.”\n\nMolson did not respond to requests for comment, and Diageo declined to comment.\n\nReleased in December 2024, the NASEM study concluded that moderate drinking is associated with a lower risk of dying from any cause, a finding the industry regularly promotes, though it also found some negative health effects.\n\nMeanwhile, in February 2022, officials at HHS began planning a separate study on the health effects of alcohol, public records show. That study, conducted by six scientists commissioned by the health officials and called the Alcohol Intake and Health Study, ⁠warned that even one drink a day can raise the risk of liver, mouth and throat cancers. Draft findings from that study were released in January 2025.\n\nIndustry groups argued that the NASEM report ​was more independent, credible and scientific than the government's work, which it said was being led by scientists biased against alcohol, a position public health groups disputed.\n\nIn January 2025, Science Over Bias, a coalition of ​alcohol, agriculture and hospitality associations, said in a statement the HHS report was the product of a “flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest” and should be disregarded.\n\nPriscilla Martinez, one of the HHS-commissioned scientists who worked on the Alcohol Intake and Health study, said that “people should know alcohol causes cancer.” She added that she is disappointed that the report, which she called scientifically rigorous, had been sidelined.\n\nALCOHOL EXPERTS FIRED OR REASSIGNED\n\nOn February 13, around a month after both studies were released, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. was sworn in as Trump’s ‍health secretary.\n\nIn early April, Kennedy laid off more than 10,000 people in a major overhaul ⁠of the health department and its agencies. Two out of five key health officials that planned to recommend tighter guidelines, including the CDC’s alcohol lead, were fired as part of the mass layoffs, according to two former government sources.\n\nThe remainder were subsequently removed from the alcohol project, the two people said. One of those people said the remaining team were removed and replaced in May.\n\nDorothy Fink, a senior health official with a background in endocrinology, took over writing the guidelines for alcohol, three sources familiar with the matter said. Fink did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson pointed Reuters to information in the scientific ⁠report accompanying the guidelines, which stated that the Trump Administration had pursued its own evidence reviews and scientific work to inform them, conducted by subject matter experts.\n\nThe Trump administration ultimately used the industry-preferred NASEM study for the new alcohol guidelines, according to the scientific report.\n\nJennifer Tiller, a newly appointed senior advisor at USDA, also oversaw the guidelines for drinking, meeting with alcohol trade groups in the spring and summer, emails obtained ‌by Reuters show. Tiller previously worked as a Congressional staffer, a role in which she questioned the health officials’ work on alcohol, according to emails obtained by Reuters.\n\nTiller referred Reuters' questions to the USDA press office. A USDA spokesperson said the guidelines are based on scientific evidence: “Recommendations, just like ‌evidence, evolve over time.”",

    "description": "Trump targeted two sectors in his latest attacks: single-family homes and defense contractors.",
    "fullText": "Home is where the heart is, but not where the institutional investors are.\n\nAt least, that's President Donald Trump's proposed plan. In a post on Truth Social, he said he's \"immediately\" taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes.\n\n\"People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIt was one of two attacks the president issued on the business world. The other targeted a group familiar with crosshairs: defense contractors.\n\nTrump said he would \"not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or do stock buybacks until they sped up production. He also criticized industry executives' \"exorbitant and unjustifiable\" compensation packages.\n\nBlackstone, a large institutional investor in residential real estate, and defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Raytheon Technologies were among the companies that saw their share prices immediately drop following the posts.\n\nFor Trump, it's in line with a new form of capitalism he's ushered in during his second term. One with more government involvement in the private sector, including taking individual stakes in companies, as BI's Emily Stewart previously covered. (You can also see my ugly mug discussing the idea here.)\n\nIt's a topic we're focusing on this year at BI with our series, \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nThe intention behind Trump's latest attacks seems squarely focused on his biggest opponent these days: affordability.\n\nFrom houses to groceries to everything in between, rising prices have been a real thorn in Trump's side. The president has maintained he inherited these problems from his predecessor, but that hasn't softened the blow for some Americans.\n\nOn paper, going after institutional investors in the housing market is the perfect antidote. The real-estate market has been a mess the past few years, and frustrated home buyers love to blame Wall Street.\n\nIn reality, it's not that clear-cut, as BI's James Rodriguez has previously reported.\n\nOne analysis from October 2023 found investors with at least 1,000 units in their portfolio owned just 0.73% of all single-family homes in the US. However, regions like the southeast have a more concentrated number of institutional investors.\n\nStill, the housing shortage is more likely the reason you can't find, or afford, your dream home. Trump didn't mention anything about institutional investors having to sell the houses they already own. And even if you want to, you can't really yell at boomers to start selling theirs.",

    "description": "The US brought huge air power to Venezuela in its operation to capture Maduro, and hinted at cyber capabilities. This is how it could have cut power.",
    "fullText": "Amid the revelations over the weekend about the US military raid to capture Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, was an unusual line from President Donald Trump.\n\n\"It was dark,\" Trump said. \"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have.\"\n\n\"It was dark,\" he added, \"and it was deadly.\"\n\nUS officials shared that the American military brought tremendous force to bear against Venezuela, hitting it with a range of assets across land, air, sea, space, and cyber, among other domains, but the specifics were limited.\n\nFootage of the American raid posted to social media showed helicopters flying over largely dark areas, but with many lights still on nearby. It's unclear how wide an area may have been affected.\n\nAnalysts told Business Insider that while the most straightforward explanation may be physical damage to a power station, US expertise in non-kinetic capabilities, like a cyberattack, means multiple methods were possible, reflecting the complex face of modern warfare.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, provided a few details Saturday, saying that Cyber Command and Space Command helped support Operation Absolute Resolve.\n\nAs helicopters carrying special operations forces approached the target, \"the United States began layering different effects provided by Spacecom, Cybercom, and other members of the interagency to create a pathway.\"\n\nHe added that the extraction team sent in to capture Maduro achieved total surprise, though a firefight kicked off once they arrived on target.\n\nLouise Marie Hurel, a cybersecurity expert at the Royal United Services Institute who has consulted for the United Nations, told BI that with Cyber Command, \"there's no hard evidence of what their role was.\"\n\nShe said that if it did manage to create the power outage, \"that's a pretty great and unsurprising, but still very well-calibrated, part of the operation.\"\n\nShe said it is possible that US actions in cyberspace might have helped to disable part of Venezuela's critical infrastructure, resulting in the power outage.\n\nIf the US had confirmed doing that, \"it would be the most public kind of communication of the US in terms of delivering some of those effects,\" she explained. \"But again, they haven't publicly communicated that, so it's only an assumption.\" For now, details on it are limited to really just Trump's statement.\n\nThe Pentagon directed Business Insider's queries on the president's statement to the White House, which did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLukasz Olejnik, independent cybersecurity and conflict consultant and visiting senior research fellow at King's College London's Department of War Studies, told Business Insider that if cyber operations were used, the big question is: \"Was it used to switch off electricity?\"\n\n\"We don't know that,\" he said. \"Still, its role cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nVenezuela has previously accused the US of launching cyberattacks against its infrastructure, but the US has not confirmed any involvement.\n\nAny such history would have affected how much planning the US needed to do.\n\nKurt Gaudette, the senior vice president of intelligence and services at US cybersecurity firm Dragos, who previously worked at the National Security Agency and was a senior US military officer, said how long a country planning such activities needs to prepare depends \"on what your level of access was over time.\"\n\nIf the US had years of access, for example, under its own intelligence approvals, \"then they could move a lot quicker.\" Cyber is not the only way to turn off the lights, though.\n\nThe US said it deployed more than 150 military aircraft for the operation, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and bombers, and explosions were recorded in the capital city.\n\nThe US has not said that it hit any power infrastructure, and there is no independent confirmation that it did so. But Venezuelan officials said some substations were seriously affected in the attack.\n\nOlejnik said that \"the simplest explanation\" for the outages is the \"kinetic targeting of a small number of substations, transmission nodes, or distribution stations.\"\n\nGaudette said it was \"very plausible\" that only physical attacks on infrastructure were used to cut power.\n\nWithout any more information than what is publicly available, he said it's more likely that cyber and physical attacks would be involved, that the US would \"approach it in a combined arms multi-domain fashion,\" not least to minimize risk.\n\nJoint, multi-domain action is a US specialty, he said. \"They treat cyber just like they would the air, the ground, and the maritime domains. So they just add it as another domain, another planning factor in anything they do.\"\n\nEmily Harding, the director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said this week that \"a joint operation like that is really quite difficult to do.\"\n\nSetting up a cyber operation like this, she explained, \"would have taken quite a long time and an incredible skill level in order to make all those pieces come together at the right moment.\"\n\nThe US put months of planning into this operation, opening up a mix of possibilities. Olejnik said it \"would not be too difficult\" for American forces to shut off the power given the time available to prep for this mission.\n\n\"That is sufficient to build the capability,\" he said.\n\nThe US brought significant airpower into this operation, along with a deeply capable cyber force, pitting that against Venezuelan infrastructure that has been in crisis for years amid the country's political and financial issues. It has resulted in blackouts and various other service interruptions without external interference.\n\nOlejnik said Venezuela's long-standing infrastructure troubles are \"highly relevant\" to what the US may have done there. \"The infrastructure and power grids are both less complex,\" he said, \"and some of them may contain outdated hardware and software.\"\n\nGaudette described Venezuela's cybersecurity and cyberspace situation as \"a very porous environment, very open, very susceptible to attack if the United States were to choose to go that route.\"\n\nHe shared that he suspects the US may have gone with a simple attack rather than a deeply complex one.\n\n\"I think a state actor would take the path of least resistance,\" he said, unless it just wanted to test out a new capability. While possible, Gaudette suggested the US would likely not want to \"burn a high-end capability\" in a mission like this.\n\nThe manufactured darkness plays to US strengths, especially for this type of operation.\n\nHarding, who previously held multiple national security positions, including at the CIA and National Security Council, said the US operates \"very well in darkness,\" and the vast intelligence available meant that \"we didn't need to see where we were going.\"\n\n\"We had all the technology we needed,\" she wrote, \"and we had it all mapped out.\"\n\nIf the US took action using cyberwarfare, it wouldn't be the first time that's been done. Hurel said Russia's actions in Ukraine are \"the clearest example that we have of that kind of cyber effect supporting military action precisely.\"\n\nShe pointed to the Russian government hacking group Sandworm, which targets Ukraine's power grid and caused blackouts that coincided with Russian missile attacks.\n\nKinetic strikes are key to this mission as well. Russia uses its drone and missile barrages to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure, causing frequent outages. The tactic has created a new worry for the West about how it could protect its vital targets in a wider war with Russia.\n\nOlejnik said that both Ukraine and Venezuela demonstrate that we can now \"expect more blended operations where cyber and electronic warfare work in tandem with broader military operations.\"\n\nGaudette said both state and non-state activists are increasingly \"using similar infrastructure or tactics, techniques, and procedures.\"\n\nHe added that it shows both countries and companies how much more insight they need into their own systems to know if any adversary is probing or harming them, something that Venezuela may not have had.\n\nThe threat, he said, \"is coming. Actually, it's already here.\"",

    "description": "The Trump administration's new guidelines removed specific recommendations on how much you should drink. Having concrete numbers helped me cut back.",
    "fullText": "This time last year, I was in for a rude awakening. Despite fancying myself a purely social drinker, I learned that I went above the recommended moderate drinking limit much more often than I realized.\n\nThe CDC says even moderate drinking can increase health issues; going above the line, even more so. It recommends no more than one drink a day, which means around seven a week, for women (the amount doubles for men). Based on the NIAAA's guidance, having four or more drinks in a day counts as binge drinking, no matter how spaced out the drinks are. This was a rule I also broke fairly frequently at parties and weddings.\n\nIn 2024, I went over the healthy limits 26 out of 52 weeks, or half the time. On 19 days out of the year, I drank four or more drinks in one day. Even though I got married that year, went to multiple weddings, and traveled a lot, the numbers still shocked me.\n\nMy first step was to panic and commit to Dry January for the month. However, I knew it wasn't realistic for me to fully quit drinking. I enjoyed the social benefits of alcohol, like feeling more relaxed, and I loved the taste of wine with dinner. I just didn't want those things to get in the way of my health.\n\nPlus, going cold turkey doesn't work for everyone. In 2025, Reframe, an alcohol reduction app, analyzed its insights from over 220,000 users who self-reported their habits. It found that social settings and weekends are the most common causes of \"slips,\" and that Damp January — drinking less without abstaining — was overall a more approachable and sustainable strategy for users than Dry January.\n\nContinuing to track my drinking, I knew I shouldn't go above three drinks in a day and try not to go above seven in a week. So, I leaned into a great loophole: following my own \"one and non\" rule, or alternating my alcoholic drinks with N/A beers and mocktails.\n\nThe habit helped me cut my drinking in half compared to the year prior. In 2025, I technically drank over the healthy limit for 14 weeks out of the year (roughly once a month). The days I had over three drinks also dropped from 19 to seven.\n\nWhile my results weren't perfect, they were a vast improvement over the year before. The downstream effects were nice too: After cutting down, I slept better, got sick less often (possibly due to a stronger immune system), and found it easier to lose fat.\n\nIt can take just a few minutes for alcohol to seep into your brain. That first drink can leave you feeling a little relaxed, even euphoric.\n\nHowever, the more you drink, the longer it takes for your liver to process the alcohol. This is what causes drunkenness and all its related health risks.\n\nLike many people, I love the feeling of that first martini — so much so that I naturally want a second. Only by the end of that one, I usually feel sleepy, more prone to headaches, and less rested in the morning. Plus, if I socialized four times a week and had two drinks each time, that would be eight drinks — above the CDC's \"one per day\" recommended limit (frustratingly, this was the case most of the time I went over).\n\nThat's where N/As come in. If I alternated my drinks — what Gen Zers also call zebra striping — and chased a beer with an alcohol-free pilsner, I'd feel like I tricked my brain into feeling I had the second drink, minus any downsides. I could feel like I had two drinks over a long dinner, when I only had one.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration announced its new dietary guidelines, including recommendations for alcohol consumption. The guidelines removed any specific recommendations for daily alcohol intake, instead focusing on drinking less in general.\n\nIn a news briefing, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, stated that moderate drinking could have some benefits.\n\n\"Alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together,\" Oz said. While he wouldn't recommend drinking alcohol in the \"best-case scenario,\" he said \"there's probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.\"\n\nBut for me, and I suspect many other people as well, social drinking was why I drank \n\nMy biggest hurdles were long social outings. I'd tell myself it didn't \"count\" as much if I had three or four drinks over a 12-hour period.\n\nSwapping for N/As helped me keep the party going without regretting my life choices. Last month, I had an unusually social day: I went to a housewarming party, watched a football game at a bar, and ended the night with a friend's birthday dinner. I had five drinks in total — two of them nonalcoholic Coronas.\n\nWhat made this rule easier to follow was how easy it's become to find booze-free options. N/A beers have become ubiquitous at bars, and I feel like every restaurant nowadays boasts at least one zero-proof cocktail. The same goes for house parties: as it's become more common to be sober or sober-curious, I find there are usually N/A options around (or, I BYOB it).\n\nNow that I have the habit of tracking my drinking and trying to adhere to more rules, the only thing left is being intentional. I found that on nights when I actively thought about getting mocktails as my second drink, I was more likely to stick to the plan.\n\nSimilarly, what usually derailed me were occasions I'd assumed were free passes for drinking, like weddings or vacations. I drank the most on hiking trips (believing I'd \"earned\" a few Negronis after an 11-mile hike) and on holidays. Looking back and noticing this pattern will make it easier for me to adjust in 2026.\n\nI know I have plenty of motivation to drink less this year. My moods improved, I had more energy at the gym, and I saved a bit of money. Cheers to that.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's new defense regulations are sending ripples through the industry, and that's a good thing, according to Palmer Luckey.\n\n\"It's good to scare people sometimes,\" Luckey, the founder and CEO of defense technology startup Anduril, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.\n\n\"President Trump is saying that he wants to see defence companies building new plants, building new factories, delivering on time, and then maintaining systems cost-effectively,\" Luckey said in an appearance on \"The Close\" on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'd say I'm broadly aligned,\" the Anduril founder said, adding that \"trying to do more of that is why I started Anduril years ago.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump criticized major defense contractors for issuing large dividends to shareholders, doing stock buybacks, and offering \"exorbitant\" pay packages while underperforming in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe president backed his rhetoric with action, signing an executive order that would ban defense contractors from stock buybacks and dividends \"until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nThe order caps defense executive salaries at $5 million, tying their annual compensation to on-time delivery, increased production, and operational improvements.\n\n\"These measures do apply in equal measure to me. I now cannot pay dividends. I now cannot do stock buybacks if I'm not investing in new plants,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Anduril founder told Bloomberg he pays himself a salary of $100,000 a year, in addition to owning \"a lot\" of Anduril.\n\nLuckey's startup, which makes autonomous weapons, is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025 and is considering an IPO. The company's mission is to modernize the US military through technology, including surveillance devices, air vehicles, and autonomous weapons.\n\nAs the United States hustles to modernize warfare, Anduril has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\n\"If these companies were doing really well, and if they were living up to their end of the bargain, I don't think you would see any action from Trump or others on this. It's really a reflection of how many problems we have with our defence industrial base,\" Luckey told Bloomberg.\n\nWithout specifying, he added that he thought some of Trump's proposals \"might be bad moves\" for the defense base, but that \"in concept,\" everything should be on the table.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump abruptly changed his tone Wednesday about his Colombian counterpart, Gustavo Petro, saying they had exchanged a friendly phone call and he’d even invited the leader of the South American country to the White House.\n\n“It was a Great Honor to speak with the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, who called to explain the situation of drugs and other disagreements that we have had,” Trump posted on his social media site. “I appreciated his call and tone, and look forward to meeting him in the near future.”\n\nHe wrote that the upcoming meeting would take place at the White House.\n\nThat came mere days after Trump said in the wake of the U.S. operation to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend that “Colombia is very sick too” and accused Petro of ”making cocaine and selling it to the United States.\"\n\nIn comments to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump added of Petro, “He’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.” Asked whether U.S. intervention was possible, Trump responded, ”Sounds good to me.”\n\nLater Wednesday, addressing thousands of protesters that he had mobilized to rally against U.S. military threats, Petro said he had spoken with Trump for roughly one hour.\n\n“I talked about two things: Venezuela and the issue of drug trafficking,” he told the crowd in downtown Bogotá, where demonstrators had just minutes earlier chanted slogans against the United States at Petro’s behest.\n\nPetro explained to the audience that Colombian politicians allegedly linked to narco-trafficking misled the U.S. president about Petro’s record to turn Trump against him.\n\n“Those (people) are responsible for this crisis — let’s call it diplomatic for now, verbal for now — that has erupted between the U.S. and Colombia,” he said.\n\nTrump now suddenly warming to Petro is especially surprising since Colombia’s president called the U.S. operation in Venezuela an “abhorrent” violation of Latin American sovereignty. He also suggested it was committed by “enslavers” and constituted a “spectacle of death” comparable to Nazi Germany’s 1937 carpet bombing of Guernica, Spain.\n\nColombia has long been among America’s staunchest Latin American allies, a pillar of Washington’s counternarcotics strategy abroad. For three decades, the U.S. has worked closely with Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine, to arrest drug traffickers, fend off rebel groups and boost economic development in rural areas.\n\nStill, before Trump's conciliatory post, tensions had been rising between the U.S. and Colombia for months.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions in October on Petro, his family and a member of his government over accusations of involvement in the global drug trade. Colombia is considered the epicenter of the world’s cocaine trade.\n\nTrump began his monthslong pressure campaign on Maduro by ordering dozens of lethal strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats launched from Venezuela in the Caribbean. He eventually expanded the operations to also target suspected vessels in the eastern Pacific that came from Colombia.\n\nThe U.S. in September added Colombia, the top recipient of American assistance in the region, to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. The designation led to a slashing of U.S. assistance to the country.\n\n“He has cocaine mills and cocaine factories,\" Trump said of Petro on Sunday. \"He’s not going to be doing it.”\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of the Colombian president's name.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is now on board with a hard-hitting sanctions package meant to economically cripple Moscow as his administration continues to negotiate a deal to end the war that began with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he met with Trump at the White House earlier Wednesday, during which the president “greenlit” the Russia sanctions bill that has been in the works for months.\n\nGraham had signaled previously that Trump has blessed the bill, only for it to encounter additional obstacles. But a White House official confirmed to The Associated Press Wednesday that the president supports the sanctions legislation.\n\n“This will be well-timed, as Ukraine is making concessions for peace and Putin is all talk, continuing to kill the innocent,” Graham said in a statement, referring to the Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe bill, chiefly written by Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., allows the administration to impose tariffs and secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russia’s oil, gas, uranium and other exports. Doing so is meant to cut off the source of financing for much of Russia’s military actions.\n\nThe White House has previously insisted on some revisions and flexibility for Trump in the sanctions package, but the White House official on Wednesday did not elaborate on whether any changes were secured.\n\nThe legislation has dozens of co-sponsors in the Senate, as well as a companion bill in the House, drafted by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nGraham said there could be a vote as early as next week, although it’s unclear how likely that will be. The Senate is poised to take up a scaled-back government funding package next week that the House is currently considering, if the House passes it. The following week is a Senate recess timed to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently trying to finalize a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old, with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, as the U.S. president’s chief negotiators.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touched on canceling the election while also dismissing the prospect in a wide-ranging speech on Jan. 6.\n\nSpeaking to House Republicans at the newly dubbed \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" he encouraged the lawmakers to campaign on his priorities to keep control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. He expressed confusion about the poor public opinion of his job performance, saying Republicans have the \"right policy.\"\n\nRiffing on tariffs during his speech, he said, \"if you have the wrong president, nothing's good.\"\n\n\"We found that out for four years... They had the worst policy and we have to even run against these people,\" he said. \"I won't say 'cancel the election, they should cancel the election,' because the fake news will say 'he wants the elections canceled, he's a dictator.' They always call me a dictator.\"\n\nTrump vs. the midterm blues: Can he get MAGA voters excited (and voting) in 2026?\n\nRepublicans currently hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, though the House's majority is shrinking with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's departure and unexpected emergencies with other GOP members.\n\nThe president's party often loses in midterm elections, though Trump in his speech rallied to break that trend. His political future depends on it, he said.\n\n\"You’ve got to win the midterms,” Trump said. “If we don’t win the midterms, it’s just going to be – they’ll find a reason to impeach me.”\n\nTrump was impeached twice in his first term by House Democrats, and the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nEvery House Representative and a third of Senators will be up for reelection on Nov. 3, 2026, when various local and state elections will also happen. That means any eligible U.S. citizen could vote in the midterm.\n\nMidterm elections usually see lower voter turnout compared to presidential election years. Though 2018, the midterms in Trump's first term, brought a jump in turnout at 53.4%, according to Census Bureau data. In 2022, the turnout was 52.2%. Compare those to the 2020 presidential election, a record-breaking year, which saw a turnout rate of 66.8%.\n\nOlder voters are more likely to turn out in non-presidential years and also more likely to vote Republican, according to Reuters. White voters and college-educated voters made up a larger portion of voters than nonvoters in the 2018 and 2022 midterms, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen, Zachary Schermele, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

    "fullText": "Terry Zink has spent his entire life in the woods.\n\nAs a 57-year-old third generation houndsman from Marion, Montana — a town tucked into the Flathead National Forest — Zink hunts mountain lions and bears while running a small archery target business.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nHe also voted for Trump, but after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) implemented deep cuts to the federal agencies that manage America’s public lands in 2025, Zink is openly second-guessing his vote.\n\n“You won’t meet anyone more conservative than me, and I didn’t vote for this,” Zink told Politico (1). “You cannot fire our firefighters. You cannot fire our trail crews. You have to have selective logging, and water restoration, and healthy forests.”\n\nAcross Montana, the impact is already being felt. Hunters are running into overgrown trails, ranchers are watching as drought resilience and wildfire mitigation funds are frozen, and outfitters and guides — who brought in roughly $314 million to Montana in 2024 — are dealing with staffing cuts that have affected their business.\n\nAnd this isn’t just happening in Montana.\n\nVersions of this scenario are playing out across the west, with real consequences for rural jobs, small businesses and the cost of hunting and fishing on public lands.\n\nSince early 2024, the federal workforce that manages America’s public lands has shrunk by about 20%, dropping from 79,070 employees to 63,141 by September 2025, according to the Center for American Progress (2).\n\nThe cuts have hit these specific agencies the hardest (3):\n\nU.S. Forest Service: Approximately 3,400 jobs cut\n\nNational Park Service: Approximately 1,000 jobs cut\n\nBureau of Land Management: Approximately 800 jobs cut\n\nRoughly 97% of Bureau of Land Management employees work outside of D.C., often in small remote towns where federal agencies are among the biggest employers (4). When ranger stations close or seasonal crews disappear, the economic fallout can spread to local gas stations, restaurants and diners, as well as hotels and motels.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, outdoor recreation generated $1.2 trillion in economic output in 2023, made up 2.3% of U.S. GDP and supported five million jobs (5). States like Montana, Alaska, Vermont and Hawaii rely on outdoor recreation at twice the national average. In Montana alone, the sector pumped $3.4 billion into the state economy in 2023 (6).",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump loyalist and Kennedy Center boss Richard Grenell is in meltdown mode after yet another prestigious artist backed out of performing at the once-iconic venue.\n\nGrammy-winning bluegrass performer Béla Fleck cited political influence for withdrawing from an upcoming show at the venue, which now has signage calling it “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\n“Performing there has become charged and political, at an institution where the focus should be on the music,” Fleck posted on social media on Tuesday before pulling out of three shows with the National Symphony Orchestra due to take place at the venue in February as part of the “American Mosaic” series.\n\n“I look forward to playing with the NSO another time in the future when we can together share and celebrate art,” Fleck added.\n\nThe post appeared to infuriate Grenell, who believes the center is bipartisan and that a “woke mob” is forcing artists to scrap shows at the venue, citing problems with President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\n“You just made it political and caved to the woke mob who wants you to perform for only Lefties,” Grenell posted on X, channelling MAGA talking points.\n\n“This mob pressuring you will never be happy until you only play for Democrats.”\n\nGrenell said the venue welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and also “people uninterested in politics.”\n\n“We want performers who aren’t political,” he said, “who simply love entertaining everyone regardless of who they voted for.”\n\nFleck’s decision follows Wicked composer Stephen Schwartz, who announced this week that he pulled out of appearing at an upcoming Washington National Opera gala at the Kennedy Center in May as it has “now become an ideological statement.”\n\nThe three-time Oscar winner said there was “no way” he would enter the building, which he helped to launch in 1971 with Leonard Bernstein.\n\n“It no longer represents the apolitical place for free artistic expression it was founded to be,” the 77-year-old said. “As long as that remains the case, I will not appear there.”\n\nIn retaliation, Grenell claimed on X that the Schwartz reports are “totally bogus” and “he was never signed and I’ve never had a single conversation on him since arriving.”\n\nHowever, the Washington National Opera confirmed to The Washington Post that Schwartz had agreed to host the gala.\n\n“The WNO had an email agreement with him regarding his participation and planning for the event,” Francesca Zambello, artistic director of the WNO, told the Post. “We respect his personal decision.”\n\nTrump’s handpicked board voted on Dec. 18 to add the president’s name to the building, despite having zero legal authority to do so.\n\nSince then, more than 10 artists have pulled out of upcoming performances at the venue, including Fleck and Schwartz.\n\nPreviously, jazz drummer Chuck Redd axed a Christmas Eve show after seeing the name change on the venue’s website while jazz group The Cookers pulled out of two New Year’s Eve shows, an annual tradition since 2006.\n\nThe Cookers’ former tenor saxophonist, Billy Harper, posted on Facebook, “I would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture.”\n\nComedian Issa Rae, folk act Rhiannon Giddens, musician Kristy Lee, trumpeter Wayne Tucker, The Brentano Quartet with violist Hsin-Yun Huang, folk duo Magpie, and Doug Varone and Dancers have all declined to play at the venue due to its links to the Trump administration.\n\nLee said of her decision, “I won’t lie to you, canceling shows hurts. This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck.”\n\nA production of Hamilton has also been pulled from a scheduled March and April run at the Kennedy Center, while musicians Ben Folds and Renée Fleming also stepped down from their advisory roles at the venue.",

He's warning both the Ravens - and the rest of the league - that they will be making a big mistake if they don't hire him. President Trump is a major fan of the Super Bowl-winning head coach.\n\nWhile some have told political figures to stay out of sports, President Trump is very much making his presence felt. The President of the United States is expected to pressure NFL teams into hiring John Harbaugh. President Trump has a close relationship with many prominent NFL owners.\n\nPresident Trump issued his official \"warning\" to the 32 NFL franchises on social media this week, following Harbaugh's firing.\n\n\"HIRE JOHN HARBAUGH, FAST,\" Trump warned. \"HE AND HIS BROTHER, ARE TOTAL WINNERS!!!\"\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously shown love for President Trump and the White House.\n\nHarbaugh, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl win in 2013, visited the White House over the summer.\n\n\"How you framed that question — I would have framed that question like: 'You got a chance to go visit with the president, man. What was that experience like?'\" Harbaugh said in response to a reporter asking him about visiting with President Trump, who had been critical of Baltimore.\n\n\"It was amazing. It was awesome. And I promise you I root for our president. I want our president to be successful just like I want my quarterback to be successful and I want my team to be successful, and it was an amazing experience.\"\n\nHis brother, Jim Harbaugh, has met more U.S. Presidents.\n\n\"He's got seven, I got four. I had a chance to meet President Obama twice — incredible experience. Had a chance to meet President Biden when he was vice president in Iraq, and spent a lot of time with him in Iraq,\" he said. \"Jim got invited also to the White House to meet President Reagan because he was a Heisman Trophy candidate. We got to go as a family, so I met President Reagan — have a picture in my office of that.\"",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump took a big swing at business on Wednesday — saying he would put a stop to practices he deemed undesirable at defense firms and large housing investors.\n\nIn a series of posts on Truth Social, the president said he wants to ban \"large institutional investors\" from buying single-family homes in the US. He also criticized defense firms' issuing dividends, stock buybacks, and \"exorbitant\" pay packages — and called out Raytheon by name. The market reacted quickly: Shares for private equity firm Blackstone and defense stocks dropped immediately following Trump's posts.\n\nWednesday evening, Trump issued an executive order aimed at defense firms, stating, \"Effective immediately, they are not permitted in any way, shape, or form to pay dividends or buy back stock, until such time as they are able to produce a superior product, on time and on budget.\"\n\nIt's the latest example of Trump taking steps to insert himself into business, having taken equity stakes in several companies over the last year. (See Business Insider's new series on \"The Future of Capitalism.)\n\nMany housing economists agree that banning large investors from buying or owning single-family homes would likely do little nationally to improve housing affordability, which has deteriorated in large part because of a shortage of homes. \n\n\"If we actually wanted to solve that problem, bringing down the cost of home ownership, what we should be doing is increasing the supply of housing,\" Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider's James Rodriguez has reported that, despite being the \"villains\" of the housing market, large investors don't actually own a significant portion of America's homes.\n\nIn October 2023, Parcl Labs found that investors with at least 10 units in their portfolio owned roughly 3.4% of all single-family homes in the country. Big investors with at least 1,000 units — a group that includes major companies such as AMH Homes, Invitation Homes, Tricon Residential, and Pretium — owned just 0.73% of units.\n\nThat share is much higher in certain housing markets, particularly in the southeast.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump will be able to stop future payouts from defense firms. The one he singled out, Raytheon, for example, announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023, and said it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nIn his posts, Trump said Raytheon \"has been the least responsive,\" \"the slowest,\" and the \"most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"\n\nOf defense firms overall, he said that until they build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.",

    "fullText": "Dairy started to roar back into fashion in 2025 — and if the Trump administration's new dietary guidelines are anything to go by, it could be about to reach new heights.\n\nThe 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines, which provide Americans with a framework for what the government considers a healthy diet, advise people to aim for three servings of full-fat dairy per day. The document, released on Wednesday, name-checks butter, whole milk, and \"real\" cheese.\n\nIn the past two years, dairy has had a glow-up as innovative products, blending health and food trends with dairy staples, hit the market. Think indie brands selling cinnamon bun butter and mint chocolate-chip probiotic ice cream, and Fairlife Ultra-filtered milk becoming more popular than ever. Dairy is typically minimally processed, high in protein, and fermented versions are good for gut health.\n\nBut the new guidance contradicts a strong body of evidence linking a diet high in full-fat dairy products and red or processed meat, which are high in saturated fats, to cardiovascular disease.\n\nRecommending full-fat dairy like butter is a big pivot from the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encouraged us to \"move to low-fat or fat-free dairy milk or yogurt or lactose-free dairy or fortified make half soy versions.\"\n\nThis was partly why plant-based diets and alt-milks became hot commodities in the 2010s. Then, some shoppers started to wonder if some of types of products were high enough in protein and more processed than they'd realized.\n\nIn 2024, the organic dairy sector grew by 9.8% up from 5.6% the previous year, according to data shared with Business Insider last year by New Hope Network, an organic-focused consultancy firm. This is far higher than the one or two percent a year increase seen since around 2015.\n\nDuring this time, whole dairy products like raw milk and home-churned butter have become synonymous with the Make America Healthy Again movement helmed by the health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an architect of the new guidelines. It's all part of the conservative vibe shift of the past year.\n\nRFK Jr. said Wednesday these new guidelines are \"how we Make America Healthy Again,\" but public health experts have been quick to point out their contradictions.\n\nNeal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said that the guidelines recommend limiting cholesterol-raising \"bad\" or saturated fat, while simultaneously promoting red meat and full-fat dairy products.",

The president said Raytheon has been \"the least responsive\" to the government's needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military's priorities.\n\n\"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with\" the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.\n\nA spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would \"not permit\" further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build \"NEW and MODERN Production Plants\" their executives' pay should be capped at $5 million.\n\nLike its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump's initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.\n\nIt's unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.\n\nLast year, the company paid out a dividend in March. It's unclear if Trump's statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.\n\nTrump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to criticize companies and their CEOs. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.\n\nIt is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company's government contracts, although he has done so as well.\n\nIn July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk's companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world's richest person. Since then, Trump has reconciled with the billionaire.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump insisted Tuesday that Republicans have “so many good nuggets” to campaign on this year as they try to hold onto their razor-thin margin in the House.\n\nBut the president’s nearly 90-minute speech before House Republicans had little in the way of a fresh policy agenda or a cohesive new message to guide the year. Instead, he meandered from defending his actions during the Capitol riot five years ago to joking about being liberal-minded to win the votes of transgender people to making head-scratching references to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's use of a wheelchair.\n\nAs he promised political “ammunition” to help Republicans, Trump emphasized the success of his 2024 presidential campaign, reminding the audience that he carried every swing state as he pondered why voters tend to turn against the party in power during midterm elections.\n\n“They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterms,” Trump said in remarks at the Kennedy Center, the performing arts venue that his allies recently renamed for him. “I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public.”\n\nHe warned that if Democrats regain control of Congress, “they'll find a way to impeach me.”\n\nTrump's appearance at the GOP's policy forum was meant to ensure House Republicans and the White House were aligned on their agenda ahead of the November midterms that will determine control of Congress and the course of Trump's final two years in office. Rising health care costs, Trump’s expansive foreign policy pursuits and other issues are dramatically splitting the GOP, as some Republicans become more comfortable crossing party lines to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson and join proposals from Democrats.\n\nIt all points to a difficult year ahead for the president and his party, especially as the House’s slim majority narrowed Tuesday with the sudden death of California Rep. Doug LaMalfa, which was announced to lawmakers as they traveled to the performing arts center, and the resignation of former Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which took effect at midnight.\n\nBut Trump spent more time rehashing past grievances during the appearance than articulating a broad election-year strategy or offering specifics on how he's addressing affordability concerns of voters.\n\n“We won every swing state. We won the popular vote by millions. We won everything,\" Trump said, recounting the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump mused about unconstitutionally seeking a third term as president and claimed it was never reported that he urged his supporters to walk “peacefully and patriotically” on Jan. 6, 2021, to the Capitol, where they rioted to try to overturn his election loss. He used his wife, first lady Melania Trump, to poke at Roosevelt, the former Democratic president who used a wheelchair.\n\nAccording to the president, Melania Trump thinks the dancing he does at his rallies is not presidential.\n\n“She actually said, ‘Could you imagine FDR dancing?’ She actually said that to me,” Trump said. “And I said there’s a long history that perhaps she doesn’t know.”\n\nTrump did try to rally the conference at times, asserting that his first year back in office was so successful that Republicans should win in November on that basis alone. He briefly touched on Venezuela and the dramatic capture of deposed president Nicolás Maduro — calling it “brilliant, tactically.” He talked about money coming into the U.S. through tariffs and direct investment, and negotiations to bring down drug prices.\n\n“You have so many good nuggets. You have to use them. If you can sell them, we’re going to win,” Trump said. He claimed that “we’ve had the most successful first year of any president in history and it should be a positive.”\n\nHouse Republicans convened as they launch their new year agenda, with health care issues in particular dogging the GOP heading into the midterm elections. Trump declined to publicly counsel GOP lawmakers on how they should handle this week’s vote — pushed by Democrats and a handful of Republicans who broke from their party -- to extend insurance subsidies that expired at year’s end, or on how to deal with the next potential government shutdown just weeks away, all with a narrower majority.\n\n“You can’t be tough when you have a majority of three, and now, sadly, a little bit less than that,” Trump said after paying tribute to LaMalfa, noting the challenges House Speaker Mike Johnson faces in keeping their ranks unified.\n\nThe president also noted that Rep. Jim Baird, R-Ind., was recovering after a “bad” car accident, further slimming Johnson’s vote margins.\n\nVotes on extending expired health insurance subsidies are expected as soon as this week, and it’s unclear whether the president and the party will try to block passage. Trump urged Republicans to own the issue of health care, a policy that Republicans have long struggled on, and said the party should be “flexible” on abortion restrictions that have been well-established federal policy.\n\n“You have to be a little flexible” on the Hyde Amendment, Trump told House Republicans. “You gotta be a little flexible. You gotta work something. You gotta use ingenuity.” The Hyde Amendment is a decades-old policy that bars federal money from being spent on abortion services.\n\nGOP lawmakers were hosting a daylong policy forum at the Kennedy Center, where the board, stocked by Trump with loyalists, recently voted to rename it the Trump Kennedy Center. The move is being challenged in court. Trump and Johnson are trying to corral Republican lawmakers at a time when rank-and-file lawmakers have felt increasingly emboldened enough to buck Trump and the leadership’s wishes on issues such as the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and Associated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.\n\nAn earlier version of this story mistakenly reported that Rep. Jim Baird represents Wisconsin. Baird represents Indiana in the U.S. House.",

Right there. Pulitzer Prize! He got one for the bullet,” Trump said, drawing applause from the crowd.\n\n“These are the ones that take the pictures. Make me look thin for a change, Doug,” he quipped. “You’re making me look a little bit heavy. I’m not happy about it.”\n\nBut Democrats think there’s little photographers can do to help the president.\n\nNot the photographers' fault https://t.co/EI8nukJYJK pic.twitter.com/oggK2CqUXd\n\n— Democrats (@TheDemocrats) January 6, 2026\n\n“Not the photographers’ fault,” they wrote in an X post, attaching candid images of Trump taken from less-than-flattering angles.\n\nTrump, a high-flying socialite and TV personality before he entered the White House, has long been conscious of his public image.\n\nIn October, he threw a Truth Social meltdown after TIME magazine put him on the cover using a photo taken from a low angle, which highlighted the drooping skin on his neck. It didn’t help that his hair practically disappeared into the sky above him.\n\n“They ‘disappeared’ my hair, and then had something floating on top of my head that looked like a floating crown, but an extremely small one,” Trump wrote. “Really weird! I never liked taking pictures from underneath angles, but this is a super bad picture, and deserves to be called out. What are they doing, and why?”\n\nThe aging president is 6’ 3” and weighs 224 pounds, according to the results of his annual physical exam released last April. His BMI puts him in the overweight category, though the president’s physician Sean Barbabella has repeatedly cleared Trump as being in “excellent health.”\n\nTrump’s fast-food-heavy diet and love for Diet Coke are unlikely to see him shed pounds soon. Florida state senator Joe Gruters once said he saw Trump eat McDonald’s fries, a Filet-O-Fish, a Quarter Pounder, and a Big Mac all in one sitting.\n\nAs for exercise, Trump doesn’t care for much physical activity outside of the golf course.\n\n“I just don’t like it. It’s boring,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal about his opinion of exercise. “To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment about the Democratic Party’s post.",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's army chief threatened preemptive military action Wednesday over the “rhetoric” targeting the Islamic Republic, likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's warning that if Tehran “violently kills peaceful protesters,” the United States “will come to their rescue.\"\n\nThe comments by Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami come as Iran tries to respond to what it sees as a dual threat posed by Israel and the United States, as well as the protests sparked by its economic woes that have grown into a direct challenge to its theocracy.\n\nSeeking to halt the anger, Iran's government began Wednesday paying the equivalent of $7 a month to subsidize rising costs for dinner table essentials like rice, meat and pastas. Shopkeepers warn prices for items as basic as cooking oil likely will triple under pressure from the collapse of Iran's rial currency and the end of a preferential subsidized dollar-rial exchange rate for importers and manufacturers — likely fueling further popular anger.\n\n“More than a week of protests in Iran reflects not only worsening economic conditions, but longstanding anger at government repression and regime policies that have led to Iran’s global isolation,” the New York-based Soufan Center think tank said.\n\nHatami spoke to military academy students. He took over as commander in chief of Iran's army, known by the Farsi word \"Artesh,\" after Israel killed a number of the country's top military commanders in June's 12-day war. He is the first regular military officer in decades to hold a position long controlled by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\n\n“The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,\" Hatami said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.\n\nHe added, “I can say with confidence that today the readiness of Iran’s armed forces is far greater than before the war. If the enemy commits an error, it will face a more decisive response, and we will cut off the hand of any aggressor.”\n\nIranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been responding to Trump's comments, which took on more significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Tehran, over the weekend. But there's been no immediate public sign of Iran preparing for an attack in the region.\n\nIranian state television reported on the start of a new subsidy of the equivalent of $7, put into the bank accounts of heads of households across the country. More than 71 million people will receive the benefit, which is 10 million Iranian rials, it reported. The rial now trades at over 1.4 million to $1 and continues to depreciate.\n\nThe subsidy is more than double than the 4.5 million rial people previously received. But already, Iranian media report sharp rises in the cost of basic goods, including cooking oil, poultry and cheese, placing additional strain on households already burdened by international sanctions targeting the country and inflation.\n\nIran's vice president in charge of executive affairs, Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah, told reporters on Wednesday that the country was in a “full-fledged economic war.” He called for “economic surgery” to eliminate rentier policies and corruption within the country.\n\nIran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the June war with Israel, its rial currency sharply fell in December. Protests began soon after on Dec. 28. They reached their 11th day on Wednesday and didn't appear to be stopping.\n\nSocial media videos purported to show new cities like Bojnourd, Kerman, Rasht, Shiraz and Tabriz, as well some smaller towns, joining the demonstrations on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the latest death toll of 36 for the demonstrations. It said 30 protesters, four children and two members of Iran’s security forces have been killed. Demonstrations have reached over 310 locations in 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces. More than 2,100 people have been arrested, it said.\n\nThe group, which relies on an activist network inside of Iran for its reporting, has been accurate in past unrest.",

    "fullText": "A preschool teacher was arrested on camera as soon as she finished a TV interview criticizing Donald Trump, fueling the debate over protest policing and free speech.\n\nJessica Plichta, 22, said she was the only person arrested among roughly 200 demonstrators at an anti-war protest in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday, hours after Nicolas Maduro was detained in Caracas by the U.S. military.\n\nIn the broadcast footage, two officers could be seen approaching from behind as she wrapped her interview with WZZM, the city’s ABC affiliate, then escorted her away as she told them, “I am not resisting arrest.”\n\nWZZM said an officer cited “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command,” and that Plichta had been charged with failure to obey a lawful command.\n\nPlichta later told Zeteo: “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as soon as I finished an interview speaking on Venezuela, I was arrested.”\n\nShe told the outlet the officers shoved her into the back of a patrol car without fastening her seat belt, then drove a short distance down the street—out of view of cameras and bystanders.\n\nAccording to Plichta, they stopped again, pulled her out, bent her over the vehicle, patted her down, and took her belongings. She recalled one officer saying they moved her because she was “making a scene.”\n\nShe also said officers repeatedly pressed her on whether she was Venezuelan, what her connection to Venezuela was, and why she had attended the protest. Plichta claimed they tried to get her to identify other demonstrators.\n\n“We are so accustomed to, and used to, repression when we speak out on anti-war topics. When we speak out for Venezuela, when we speak out for Palestine, we expect the police to want to shut that down,” she told Zeteo.\n\n“It just shows how much they feel they can get away with things, how easy it is for them to isolate people from the public eye when they’re doing this.”\n\nPlichta said she largely stayed quiet as officers took her to jail, where she said the same questions continued. She was released about three hours later after other protesters gathered to demand she be freed and was seen punching the air in a video shared on Facebook.\n\nThe Grand Rapids Police Department disputed her claims in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson said more than “25 announcements were made from the PA system of a marked police cruiser for the group [of protesters] to leave the roadway and relocate their activities to the sidewalk,” but that they had “refused lawful orders” to move to the sidewalk and “began blocking intersections.”\n\nAdding that supervisors told officers they could arrest anyone who could be “positively identified,” the spokesperson confirmed only one arrest was made. The Beast followed up to ask why only Plichta had been arrested, but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Rapids is David LaGrand, a Democrat.\n\nThe incident came to light as Trump, 79, tries to sell the Maduro operation at home, despite signs of public unease.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released Monday found about one in three Americans approve of the U.S. strike, while 72 percent worry the U.S. will become too involved.\n\nIt is also a small part of a much larger information war that has even seen Trump amplify mislabeled footage on Truth Social to claim mass celebrations after the Maduro capture—a video that fact-checkers traced to an unrelated 2024 protest.",

    "fullText": "Deal indicates Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention\n\nDonald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts.\n\n“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” Trump said in a post online.\n\nVenezuelan government officials and state company PDVSA did not provide comment.\n\nVenezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to the blockade imposed by Trump, as part of the pressure campaign that culminated in the toppling of Nicolás Maduro who was seized from his country by US forces over the weekend.\n\nTop Venezuelan officials have called Maduro’s capture a kidnapping and accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserver, however Tuesday’s agreement is a strong sign that the government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.\n\nTrump has said he wants interim president Delcy Rodríguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.\n\nUS energy secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.\n\nChina has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.\n\nUS crude prices fell more than 1.5% after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron, PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.\n\nChevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars\n\nHours before Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, Rodríguez hardened her tone against the US, saying in a televised address that “no external agent governs Venezuela” – a clear rebuttal to the US president’s claim that, after the capture of Maduro, the US would now run the South American country.\n\nIt marked another shift in tone from Maduro’s former vice-president. After being sworn in as president by Venezuela’s supreme court on Saturday, Rodríguez released a conciliatory statement late on Sunday in which she “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of cooperation”.\n\nIn Tuesday’s address, however, Rodríguez reverted to harsher language, describing Saturday’s strike – the first large-scale US military operation on South American soil – as a “terrible military aggression” and a “criminal attack” whose “absolutely illegal outcome, in violation of international law”, was the “kidnapping” of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.\n\n“We are a people who do not surrender, who do not give up, and we are here, governing together with the people. The government of Venezuela rules in our country – no one else. There is no external agent governing Venezuela. It is Venezuela, its constitutional government, and the consolidated power of the people,” said Rodríguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice-president since 2018.",

    "description": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.",
    "fullText": "A Caracas highway is choked with cars.\n\nBut far from typical rush hour traffic, Avenida Boyacá, a highway running alongside El Avila National Park in Venezuela’s capital, has ground to a halt because masked men holding Kalashnikovs are stopping drivers and demanding to search their phones and cars.\n\nThe gangs of armed men, part of pro-Maduro militias known as Colectivos, scoured vehicles at hastily erected checkpoints following a government directive to root out Venezuelans in support of the US’s brazen capture of Nicolás Maduro.\n\nDays after the sudden decapitation of the Maduro regime, Venezuelans have been left fearing what could come next as mobs of men dressed in civilian clothes with assault rifles slung over their shoulders roam the streets.\n\n“The future is uncertain, the Colectivos have weapons, the Colombian guerrilla is already here in Venezuela, so we don’t know what’s going to happen, time will tell,” Oswaldo, a 69-year-old Venezuelan shop owner, told The Telegraph.\n\nA state of emergency decree published on Monday has sought to crack down on any public celebration of the US operation. It ordered police to “immediately begin the national search and capture of everyone involved in the promotion or support for the armed attack by the United States”.\n\nOne Venezuelan, who wished to remain anonymous, said she would no longer leave the house with her phone over fears it could be scoured for anti-Maduro texts or photographs, which could lead to her imprisonment.\n\nThe paramilitaries have already arrested 14 journalists and media workers – 11 from foreign news outlets – for hours before releasing some of them. The whereabouts of other journalists are unknown.\n\nThe presence of Colectivos, armed men who ride around on motorcycles and are used as an unofficial government arm of repression, suggests that Maduro loyalists are desperately attempting to maintain their grip on the country.\n\nVideos circulating on social media shows armed men declaring they would not allow Donald Trump and US “pigs” to come in and plunder the country’s natural resources.\n\nAnother video shows interior minister Diosdado Cabello, Mr Maduro’s closest ally, posing with a crowd of the armed militia as they shouted: “Always loyal, never traitors.”\n\nMr Cabello, who has a $50m bounty on his head for drug trafficking charges, largely controls the Colectivos.\n\nAs Mr Maduro pleaded his innocence and claimed he was a “prisoner of war” during his arraignment at Manhattan Federal Court, armed supporters said his heart and soul remained in Venezuela.\n\n“There’s enough people here, there’s enough balls here to fight for this revolution, to fight for this motherland,” said a man who identified himself as Freddy Rodriguez, a member of Cupaz, a network set up by Maduro in 2019 to control protests.\n\nOn Monday morning, most shops and businesses had reopened in Caracas and the long queues of panicked Venezuelans trying to buy provisions had dissipated.\n\nPolice and intelligence officers lined the streets in the centre of Caracas, with two main avenues closed as Delcy Rodriguez, Mr Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodrigue.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said while holding up her right hand.\n\n“I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.”\n\nHer comments struck a different tone than on Sunday when she said she had “invited the US government to work together on an agenda of co-operation” in the wake of Mr Trump’s warning that she would pay a “very big price” should she not do as instructed.\n\nIn Caracas, Venezuelans who had initially welcomed Maduro’s capture, hoping it would lead to real change in the country, were left feeling deflated by Ms Rodriguez’s ascension and the continuation of Mr Maduro’s regime.\n\nThe country’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. However, the Supreme Court declared Mr Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, the vice president takes over for up to 90 days – a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nMaría Corina Machado, the Venezuelan Opposition leader and recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the crackdown by the militia was “really alarming” and that the country’s transition to democracy needed to happen.\n\n“Delcy Rodriguez, as you know, is one of the main architects of torture, persecution, corruption, narco-trafficking,” Ms Machado told Fox News. “She’s a main ally and liaison of ‍Russia, China, Iran, certainly not an individual who could be trusted by international investors and she’s really rejected by the Venezuelan people.”\n\nThere has been no discussion of holding democratic elections and the future of the country still hangs in the balance.\n\n“I wanted a change in government because these people have done a lot of damage to the country; they forgot they were public servants, they thought they owned the country,” shopkeeper Oswaldo said.\n\n“But now we’re at the same point, he has left and another has replaced him – Delcy Rodriguez, Diosdado Cabello and Vladimir Padrino López – they’re all still here.”\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph in Plaza Altamira while she waited for a job interview, Aurora said she had hoped for a regime change but said her main concern was putting food on the table.\n\n“Most international leaders don’t agree with what happened, but it happened.\n\n“We saw it coming, everybody saw it coming, but nobody imagined it would happen like this, so violent. Some wished for it and others not, but there is not one country in the world that can interfere in the government and say the oil is mine, no, this is a lie, this belongs to the Venezuelan people.”\n\nWhile she pushed back at Mr Trump’s suggestion he would “run” Venezuela, Aurora, a care worker from Petare, said: “We needed a change and it was necessary and now we need a transition.”\n\n“Every birth involves pain and now we have to move forward,” she added.\n\nOthers were less accepting of the current situation.\n\n“Honestly, I think this should not have happened; he [Maduro] should be in his country governing his country,” a 59-year-old sports coach, who requested to remain anonymous, said.\n\n“All I wish for Venezuela is for things to be calm, we’ve been through so much already... I know that we weren’t well, but emotionally and physically we were more at peace.”\n\nThe thought of Mr Trump deciding what comes next for Venezuelans, as opposed to holding fair elections, has left many concerned.\n\n“I don’t agree with what Trump said, he said he was coming to run our country – I want a transition, I want elections,” Oswaldo said.\n\n“If the majority of people are in favour of Delcy, fine, if it is a transparent election and we will recognise the results peacefully – if the Chavismo wins, then ok, but if the opposition wins, they will have to recognise their defeat.”\n\nJournalists in Caracas contributed to this report but asked to withhold their names for fear of reprisals from the regime\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he's wasting no time when it comes to oil in Venezuela.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Tuesday, Trump said that the interim president of Venezuela will \"be turning over\" between 30 and 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil, and that the oil would be sold at market prices, with the revenue overseen by him as president to ensure it benefits both Venezuela and the US.\n\n\"It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nHe added that he directed Energy Secretary Chris Wright to carry out the plan \"immediately.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the plan will face legal hurdles, and further details are unknown. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comments.\n\nThe current interim leader of Venezuela is Delcy Rodríguez, who was sworn in as acting president on January 5, 2026, after the US captured and detained the country's former President Nicolás Maduro, alongside his wife. Rodríguez is a longtime Maduro loyalist and originally served as the Vice President of Venezuela. She has so far not spoken out on whether she would cooperate with Trump's plan.\n\nTrump's comments build on his previous remarks that he would \"take back\" Venezuela's oil reserves and revive the country's battered energy sector, which has faced sanctions and mismanagement.\n\nTrump also previously said in an interview with NBC News that the US could reimburse American oil companies for expanding their operations in Venezuela, but he did not have an estimate on how much the subsidy would cost.\n\nEven though a larger supply could lead to lower costs for American consumers, the downward pressure on prices could disincentivize large oil companies from investing in Venezuela. It could also take years to build functioning infrastructure.\n\nVenezuela's oil production currently accounts for less than 1% of the global oil output, despite possessing the world's largest known oil reserves.",

    "description": "Many Greenlanders are interested in working with the US, but they all bristle at the idea of being bought or taken by force.",
    "fullText": "If Greenlanders weren't concerned by President Donald Trump's threats to annex the territory in his first term, many of them are now.\n\nIn the days since the United States' surprise raid into Venezuela, there's been a renewed focus on Trump's interest in the island, sparking fear among locals.\n\n\"I don't know what he's able to do. Most of me is trying to tell myself, 'Don't worry, everything's going to be fine,' but still I'm worried,\" Tupaarnaq Kreutzmann Kleist, a sheep farmer in South Greenland, told Business Insider's Sarah Andersen on Tuesday.\n\nCasper Frank Møller, CEO and cofounder of Greenland tourist company Raw Arctic, echoed Kleist's concerns, saying that he and many of his peers are worried about how the situation may affect their finances.\n\n\"We've made investments into developing our tourism aspects of our company, and it comes with risk now because of the geopolitical situation and the threats by Trump, so of course, yeah, we're all really worried,\" he told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue Greenland, including \"utilizing the US Military.\"\n\nTrump's had his sights set on the Arctic island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, since his first term in office. He has argued that Greenland's location makes it strategically important, as the melting of Arctic ice opens up new shipping routes and intensifies competition with Russia and China. The island is also rich in critical minerals and already hosts a key US military base, which American officials say is vital to missile defense and Arctic security.\n\nWhen Trump initially raised the topic of buying Greenland in 2019, Greenlandic influencer and engineer Qupanuk Olsen told Business Insider she and other locals thought it was a joke, and said she still didn't take it seriously when Trump resurfaced talks in late 2024.\n\nThat changed when Donald Trump Jr. visited Nuuk in January 2025. \"That's when we realized that Trump's words were no longer just words,\" Olsen said in June. \"They are real, and he means what he says.\" Business Insider wasn't able to reach Olsen this week for a follow-up.\n\nIn the wake of the raid on Venezuela, Møller said on Tuesday that Trump's threats to annex Greenland feel \"much more realistic that it will actually happen\" than when he spoke with Business Insider in January 2025.\n\nUS interest had at least one positive effect, Olsen said in June: It pushed Greenlanders to think more seriously about their place in the world and the need to speak for themselves.\n\n\"It was such a huge wake-up call for everyone in Greenland because suddenly we needed to have an opinion whether we still want to stay under Denmark, whether we should become independent, or whether we should become a state under the United States,\" she said. \"We certainly had options. So those options were helpful in the beginning for the independence movement.\"\n\nThat mindset may be shifting. Kleist said she's worried that \"we as the local indigenous Greenlandic people are slowly going against each other now,\" she told Business Insider on Tuesday. Some want to stand with America, others with Denmark, she said. Ultimately, though, the dream is for Greenland to become its own independent country, she added.\n\n\"We want Greenland to be the Greenlanders, and we're not for sale. We are not to be taken over,\" Møller said.\n\nNaaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister of natural resources, business, energy, justice, and gender equality, said in June that she sees much of the American administration's interest in Greenland as an opportunity for collaboration. But she said the way Trump is going about it is wrong.\n\n\"I think if we take the temperature down a bit and de-escalate the conflict level and the rhetoric, I think we can, in agreement with each other, find many paths forward that are mutually beneficial for both the US and for us,\" Nathanielsen said in June. \"But we don't appreciate being talked about as a commodity, as something you can buy or sell or acquire or take. That is, of course, offensive to all people.\"\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.\n\n\"The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,\" she wrote. \"We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism. We have had our share of that.\"\n\nDenmark, Trump has argued, is not doing enough to safeguard Greenland. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security,\" Trump told a group of reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.\n\nThe same day, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen urged the US in a statement to \"stop the threats against a historically close ally.\" Frederiksen has previously rejected Trump's suggestions outright, telling him that Greenland is not for sale and that any idea of annexation is \"absurd.\"\n\nFrederiksen has warned that any US military action against Greenland would severely damage NATO unity, raising questions about whether the alliance could withstand such a conflict between allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, major European leaders, including those from France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, and Denmark, released a joint statement defending Greenland. \"Greenland belongs to its people,\" the statement said. \"It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - The 92-year-old judge overseeing the Nicolas Maduro case has said he displays a Hebrew scripture from the Torah on the wall of his Manhattan chambers: “Tzedek, tzedek tirdof” — “Justice, justice you shall pursue.\"\n\nAn Orthodox Jew who has been ​on the bench for almost three decades, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein has been outspoken about how he tries to promote fairness ‌and the impact of his faith on his judicial philosophy.\n\nHellerstein opened the court hearing on Monday by saying he wants a fair trial for the ousted Venezuelan leader, who pleaded not ‌guilty on Monday to narco-terrorism charges.\n\n\"That's my job, and that's my intent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nON THE SEVENTH DAY HE CONTEMPLATES\n\nHellerstein said in a 2020 podcast that he schedules sentencing hearings for Fridays, so that he can spend Shabbat — the Jewish sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday nightfall — reflecting on whether the prison sentence he handed down was appropriate.\n\nHellerstein has ruled against President Donald Trump in recent years. He has also spoken up when he believes lawyers are not ⁠best serving their clients.\n\nIn a 2013 law review article, ‌he wrote that some lawyers were \"outraged\" and accused him of \"arrogation of power\" when he rejected a $675 million settlement negotiated between New York City and injured first responders who raced to the World Trade Center after the attacks of ‍September 11, 2001.\n\nHellerstein concluded that, while no statute or rule clearly addressed whether the deal needed his blessing, he had inherent authority to reject it as inadequate.\n\nThe attorneys ended up presenting Hellerstein with a new settlement that added $125 million for victims.\n\nHellerstein \"is a man of strongly held convictions and he seeks to find a way to harmonize ​the law with his understanding of justice,\" said Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who has observed Hellerstein on the bench.\n\nHellerstein has spoken ‌candidly about how his Jewish values affect his decision-making.\n\n\"As a judge, and as a Jew, I consider that everything I do reflects God and affects His image,\" he wrote in the 2013 article.\n\nIn the 2020 podcast, Hellerstein said he believes he was \"the first Orthodox boy employed by a gentile or Jewish firm in New York City.\"\n\n\"I'm pleased to say that after me there were others, and some credited me with having broken the precedent,\" Hellerstein said.\n\nHellerstein already had a long career before President Bill Clinton nominated him to the federal bench in 1998.\n\nFrom 1957 to 1960, Hellerstein served in the ⁠Judge Advocate General's Corps, the legal arm of the United States Army.\n\nIn 1960, Hellerstein ​joined the now-defunct firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, where he ended up practicing for much ​of his career.\n\nA HISTORY OF REBUKING TRUMP'S LEGAL GAMBITS\n\nIn a high-profile case in 2020, Hellerstein ordered the release of former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, after Trump's Justice Department tried to revoke his home confinement and return him to jail.\n\nHellerstein ‍concluded Trump's administration was retaliating against Cohen ⁠for writing a book.\n\nIn 2023, Hellerstein denied a request by Trump to move to federal court his New York criminal case relating to a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was tried in state court and found guilty of 34 felony ⁠counts.\n\nIn May 2025, Hellerstein rejected an effort by the Trump administration to use a wartime law to send alleged gang members to Venezuela, saying the men had been improperly denied ‌their day in court.\n\n“This is the United States of America,\" he said. \"People are being thrown out of the country because of ‌their tattoos.”",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterms or else he will get impeached by Democrats.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Republicans must win the 2026 midterm elections or else he will get impeached by Democrats.\n\n\"You gotta win the midterms 'cause, if we don't win the midterms, it's just gonna be - I mean, they'll find a reason to impeach me,\" Trump said at a retreat for House Republican lawmakers in Washington. \"I'll get impeached.\"\n\nThe president urged his fellow Republicans to fight in a more unified fashion on issues ranging from gender politics to healthcare and election reforms, and to sell his policies to a public angry about cost of living issues.\n\nTrump's agenda is on the line in November's elections, when all the seats in the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate's seats will be contested.\n\nDuring the speech, Trump predicted an epic win for Republicans in the elections but also expressed concerns about historical precedent that the party of the sitting president usually fares poorly.\n\n\"They say that when you win the presidency, you lose the midterm,\" Trump said at the Kennedy Center, a Washington performing arts center that was recently renamed to include a mention of Trump. \"I wish you could explain to me what the hell's going on with the mind of the public,\" Trump said.\n\nHouse Republicans have shown enormous deference to Trump so far, ceding much of Congress' authority over spending and other matters to his administration. But they have started to show glimmers of independence. The House could vote this week to override a veto Trump issued last month that canceled water projects in Colorado and Utah, though it is not clear whether the effort will get the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House of Representatives during his 2017-2021 term in office, faulting him for what they said were abuses of power involving Ukraine and ahead of the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. The Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him in both cases.\n\nReporting by Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt, Bo Erickson, Andy Sullivan and Richard Cowan, Editing by Franklin Paul and Alistair Bell",

    "fullText": "It's only been days since an audacious U.S. raid snatched Nicolás Maduro from a Venezuelan military base and sped him to a Brooklyn prison, yet Detroit-area Trump supporter Aaron Tobin can already see it all playing out on the big screen.\n\nIt'll be the subject of movies for years to come, he predicts. “I am thrilled.” Plenty of others who voted for President Donald Trump and spoke to The Associated Press about the raid are applauding, too — at least for now.\n\nThe seizure of Venezuela's authoritarian leader and his wife has forced another reckoning on the “Make America Great Again” coalition, already rocked by the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files and strained by rising health insurance premiums and living costs.\n\nTrump promised his voters that “America First” would stand against more foreign entanglements. Instead, he intervened with force and without congressional approval in a new frontier, a South American capital so far from Washington that Google Maps says it “can't seem to find a way there.”\n\nThe geopolitical action film that Tobin sees in his mind is only at its opening scene, before all the complexities of uprooting a foreign government by a U.S. president's fiat come rushing in. U.S. forces entered and exited swiftly. But what happens next?\n\nTrump finds early but not endless support\n\nEarly on, the pushback from congressional Republicans and Trump's core constituencies has been guarded, in contrast to their uproar over the Epstein episode or the tensions coursing through Republican politics over the now-expired health insurance subsidies.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump voters interviewed by AP journalists around the country praised the operation and expressed faith in Trump's course. But not always limitless faith. They did not all back up Trump's claim that those who “voted for me are thrilled. They said, ‘This is what we voted for.’”\n\n“I support him so far,” Paul Bonner, 67, told AP while browsing at a Trump merchandise store in Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “Until he messes up, I support him.”\n\nTrump's apparent willingness to stay involved in Venezuela and his intensifying rhetoric about expanding U.S. power elsewhere in the hemisphere are making some of his die-hard supporters nervous.\n\nNot all of them are reaching for the popcorn yet.\n\nIn Mississippi, a conflicted Trump voter\n\nChase Lewis, 24, of Philadelphia, Mississippi, said the move caught him off guard and he still isn’t sure whether he supports it. “It’s good that they’re finally freed from that dictatorship,” he said of Venezuelans, “but I don’t know what it’s going to cost us.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t want my friends that are serving right now to be dragged into a war because we went and stuck our nose in Venezuela’s business.” He noted that Trump had campaigned against starting new wars. “Depending on how you look at it,” he said, “this was an act of war.”\n\nAn electrician apprentice who gave up his delivery job because he needed to make more money, Lewis said he wants to see the Trump administration focus on bringing down costs for young people like himself. He also wants the president to make life better for veterans and worries about plunging the country into more conflicts.\n\nIn Colorado, cheers and caution from Trump voters\n\nTo Trump voter Travis Garcia, leaning against his red pickup truck on a chilly evening in Castle Rock, Colorado, it’s a slam-dunk. “Of course I’m going to be happy that they captured a dictator that’s constantly sending drugs our way,” he said, “If we’re not gonna do it, who’s gonna do it?”\n\nThe 45-year-old, who works in remodeling, said the operation reinforces Trump's stature as “a powerful man who follows through on his word and isn’t going to be shy and timid and let other countries run the rules.”\n\nMary Lussier, 48, a flight attendant from the town of Larkspur, was so amazed by the success of the mission in Venezuela that she would be OK with more such operations. She recalled videos of Venezuelans tearfully celebrating Maduro's removal and said fewer bad leaders “would make the world a little bit lesser of a bad place.”\n\nStill, Lussier wouldn’t want U.S. soldiers stuck in a prolonged conflict, and much of her admiration for the operation hinged less on the possible benefits to the U.S. than on the smooth efficiency and bravado of the raiders.\n\nOutside a Safeway grocery store in Castle Rock, Patrick McCans, 66, said delicately that Trump's intervention was “a little contrary to what he campaigned on.”\n\n“I would like to see more of a diplomatic way of making change,” said the retired engineer. Still, he said, pondering for a moment, “I think in this case it might have been warranted.”\n\nInstead of playing ball, Maduro was “playing chicken with Trump, and Trump doesn’t like chicken,” he said, chuckling from beneath a Baltimore Ravens baseball cap.\n\nThe Colorado Trump supporters interviewed by AP all applauded the military operation’s smoothness and “class,” as one described it. But that support could waver if the U.S. is drawn into a longer conflict, which none of them would support.\n\nFew mentioned Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil, but thought Maduro's removal would benefit citizens and slow the drug trade and immigration to the U.S.\n\nFrom Pennsylvania: Good riddance to Maduro\n\nAt the Golden Dawn Diner in Levittown, Pennsylvania, Ron Soto, 88, expressed unreserved faith in the president's ability to manage what comes next. The retired tractor-trailer driver regularly visits the diner to meet friends, drink coffee and catch up.\n\nMaduro is an “awful man,” he said. But should U.S. forces go into other countries, like Cuba, as it did in Venezuela? “I don’t think they’ll have to,” he said. “Because he (Trump) put the fear in them.”\n\nAs for Trump's comment at one point that his administration would “run” Venezuela, Soto said the president will “straighten that country out and make it into a democracy if he can. I don’t know if he can.”\n\nAt the Neshaminy Mall, in Bensalem, retired firefighter Kevin Carey, 62, pronounced himself supportive of what Trump did but aware of the risks.\n\n“I wouldn’t say thrilled but I’m cautiously optimistic,” he said. Carey recalled the seizing of U.S. hostages by Iranian revolutionaries in 1979 as an indication of what might happen if the conflict escalates. But “he'll take all actions to avoid that, I believe,” he said of Trump.\n\nOn any further foreign intervention, Carey broke out laughing when he said: “He wants Greenland to be part of America!”\n\nAt the Trump merchandise store where Bonner shopped, banners and other items proclaiming “Trump 2028” are on display. Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running in 2028.\n\n“I know he can’t run for president” in 2028, said Bonner, a propane company worker. Still, he wanted a lawn sign “just to irritate people” but didn't find one.\n\nThe crisp military operation plainly left him impressed. “They got in and they got out, did what they had to do,” he said. Of Maduro, he said: “He’s an enemy of the United States so I support Trump 100%.”\n\nExiting a Walmart in Martinsville, Indiana, Mark Edward Miller, 75, from nearby Mooresville, said the only thing that surprised him about Trump's intervention was that word of it did not leak in advance. The consistent Trump voter was an aircraft maintenance specialist in the Air Force before his retirement.\n\n“I don’t feel like he’s actually taken over a country,” Miller said. “I believe that he’s doing exactly what our country should be doing — supporting, especially in our hemisphere, governments that are friendly with us” and challenging those that are hostile.\n\nTobin, the man in Michigan who sees a cinematic future for the raid, not only approved of the operation but wants more of them.\n\n“Especially if they were as successful as this last one where we didn’t lose any troops, we didn’t lose any planes or ships,” Tobin said during a visit to the Oakland County Republican Party headquarters, where he was surrounded by Trump and GOP memorabilia. “I am thrilled and surprised” by what happened.\n\n“Cuba’s very nervous right now,” he said. “And the Cuban people are suffering immensely from their horrible situation and their economy. Iran might be next.”\n\nThe three-time Trump voter is an active member of the local Republican Party, a certified firearms instructor and head of a bicycling group in his hometown of Oak Park, Michigan.\n\nHis takeaway: “President Trump does not speak idly. If he says he’s going to do something, he does something.”\n\nBedayn reported from Colorado, Catalini from Pennsylvania, Householder from Michigan, Bates from Mississippi, Lamy from Indiana and Woodward from Washington.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday took more shots at Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), insisting there was “something wrong” with the Kentucky Republican.\n\nIn recent months, Massie repeatedly broke from the GOP and criticized the actions of Trump. Massie has most notably aligned with Democrats on the issue of deceased sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, joining Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) in his crusade to release the Epstein files.\n\nWeeks before U.S. forces invaded Venezuela and apprehended President Nicolas Maduro, Massie claimed Trump’s interest in the country was primarily about “oil and regime change.”\n\nIn response, Trump has consistently shaded Massie for his perceived betrayal of the Republican Party. On Christmas, the president called out Massie by name in a Truth Social post.\n\nDuring his remarks at a GOP retreat in Washington, D.C., Trump praised the efforts of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) before continuing his attacks on Massie:\n\n“A lot of times they’ll say, ‘I wish Mike were tougher.’ He’s tough. He’s tough as anybody in the room, actually. But can’t be tough when you have a majority of three — and now, sadly, a little bit less than that. But, you can’t be Trump. You can’t, ‘I want you!’ You know, you make 10 enemies, 20 enemies. That’s the end of that, right?” mused Trump. “Everybody loves him. I would say there’s one person he’s given up on. He just gave up on this guy. He’s so bad. He never votes for us. No matter how good, he won’t vote for us. There’s a sickness there. There’s something wrong. You can have the greatest bill, the greatest for the country — forget about for Republicans — great, great, great for the country. ‘I’m a no vote.’ We don’t even bother calling him at three in the morning, do we?”\n\nThe post ‘There’s a Sickness There’: Trump Tells House Republicans ‘There’s Something Wrong’ With Their Colleague Thomas Massie first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "fullText": "President says a ‘tremendous amount of money’ will need to be spent repairing country’s infrastructure\n\nWhy Venezuelan crude appeals to US refineries\n\nVenezuela live – latest updates\n\nDonald Trump has suggested US taxpayers could reimburse energy companies for repairing Venezuelan infrastructure for extracting and shipping oil.\n\nTrump acknowledged that “a lot of money” would need to be spent to increase oil production in Venezuela after US forces ousted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, but suggested his government could pay oil companies to do the work.\n\n“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” the president said.\n\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, reportedly plans to meet representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil at the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech & Utilities Conference in Miami later this week.\n\nRepresentatives of Trump’s administration are planning to meet executives to discuss increasing Venezuelan production, Reuters reported.\n\nThe meetings are crucial to the Trump administration’s hopes of getting top oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.\n\nThe three biggest US oil companies – Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s removal, Reuters reported. This contradicted Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, before and since Maduro was seized.\n\n“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to increase production and exports of heavy, unctuous crude from Venezuela, a former Opec nation that sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be processed by specially designed US refineries.\n\nAchieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.\n\nVenezuela produces on average about 1.1m barrels of oil a day, down from the 3.5m barrels produced in 1999 before a government takeover of the domestic industry.\n\nIt is unclear which executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move in to Venezuela.\n\n“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\n\nExxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment to Reuters.\n\nAsked if the administration had briefed any oil companies before the military operation, Trump said, “No. But we’ve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”\n\n“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News. “But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”\n\nHe told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies. “I speak to everybody,” he said.\n\nTrump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars increase Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades because of underinvestment and sanctions.\n\nBut those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.\n\nChevron is the only US major operating in Venezuela’s oilfields. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operated in the country before their projects were nationalised by former president Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025 on Monday, as Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Lack of verified information and rapidly advanced AI tools make it difficult to separate fact from fiction on US attack\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump announced a “large-scale strike” against Venezuela early on Saturday morning, false and misleading AI-generated images began flooding social media. There were fake photos of Nicolás Maduro being escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.\n\nThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
