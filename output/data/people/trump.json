    "description": "Trump suggested Democrats ‘loved Jeffrey Epstein’ and said they should ‘enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!’",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has shared a bizarre Christmas day social media post about Jeffrey Epstein, saying that he dropped ties with the late sex offender “long before it became fashionable,” and that the controversy surrounding the release of the so-called Epstein files is a “Radical Left Witch Hunt.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been facing ongoing scrutiny, mainly from Democrats but also some Republicans, for its handling of government files related to Epstein as the public pushes for more transparency about the disgraced financiers’ life and crimes.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein...only to ‘drop him like a dog’ when things got too HOT, falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J. Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday evening.\n\nThe president was friends with Epstein decades ago, calling him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 New York magazine profile. In the midst of the Epstein controversy, The Wall Street Journal reported on a lewd birthday card Trump supposedly gave Epstein in 2003, but the president has denied that he authored such a letter.\n\nBut Trump has said their relationship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The White House has said Trump did “nothing wrong” and that the president kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for being a “creep.”\n\nTrump suggested in Wednesday’s Truth Social post that these people who thought Epstein was “the greatest guy on earth” were all Democrats.\n\n“When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt...and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do...Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!” Trump wrote.\n\nWhen the Justice Department started to release its trove of Epstein documents last Friday — thanks to Congress pushing through legislation to force the Trump administration to reveal all the information it had on the convicted sex offender — photos of former Democratic President Bill Clinton emerged.\n\nIn one photo, Clinton and Epstein were smiling as they stood next to each other wearing silky shirts. In another, Clinton was swimming in a pool with Epstein’s longtime associate and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump might be president, but even he has to endure holiday dinners with his in-laws.\n\nTrump, 79, spent Christmas Eve at his Mar-a-Lago estate alongside family members including First Lady Melania Trump, 55, and her father, Viktor Knavs—who is just two years the president’s senior.\n\nThe trio was seated together at an extravagant Christmas Eve dinner Wednesday night at the Palm Beach resort, which Forbes valued at $325 million in 2023. In video footage circulating online from the event, Knavs, 81, appears animated as he chats with his daughter, who leans in closely to hear him.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, stares straight ahead, seemingly frozen out of the conversation. He sits glumly scanning the room before he notices the camera is on him, prompting a stiff, performative fist shake.\n\nCritics of the president were quick to seize on the moment online, pointing to what they described as Melania’s lack of interest. “Could she sit any farther away?” one X user quipped. “Trump seethes with rage & embarrassment that Melania only wants to talk to her dad,” another wrote in a post viewed 1.6 million times.\n\nKnavs and his late wife, Amalija, both worked in fashion and sales in Slovenia before relocating to the United States after their daughter married the real estate scion. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2018, despite their son-in-law’s hardline stance on immigration.\n\nA fixture of the president’s family life, Knavs has appeared at events ranging from Trump’s inauguration to his Thanksgiving dinner table. When Barron Trump—the president’s youngest son and the only child he shares with the first lady—graduated from the prestigious Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in May 2024, Knavs was the only family member in attendance besides Barron’s parents, the Palm Beach Post reported.\n\nMelania Trump and Barron Trump are both known to have close relationships with the Slovenian businessman. Melania Trump was largely absent from the now-president’s third and final campaign as she cared for her mother, Amalija Knavs, who died Jan. 9, 2024, and was laid to rest in Palm Beach, according to reports.\n\nBarron Trump remained close to his grandfather throughout the funeral, according to reports.\n\nIn 2016, Melania Trump’s childhood friends told The New York Times that they remembered Knavs—who was a member of the elite Communist Party in what was then Yugoslavia—as a “larger-than-life personality” much like Trump himself.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s campaign denied that Melania Trump’s father was ever an “active member” of the party.\n\n“But he was pretty successful over there,” Trump said in a 2016 interview. “It’s a different kind of success than you have here. But he was successful.”\n\nTrump may have appeared fatigued at dinner after a jam-packed afternoon, during which he took calls from children across the United States as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command’s Santa tracker.\n\nIn true Trump fashion, the decades-old presidential tradition took a political turn.\n\n“Pennsylvania is great. We won Pennsylvania, actually three times, but we won Pennsylvania. We won it in a landslide. So I love Pennsylvania,” Trump enthusiastically told a 5-year-old from the Keystone State—who was not yet alive during his first two presidential campaigns.\n\nThe president later capped off Christmas Eve with a scathing post on Truth Social, decrying what he called the “Radical Left Scum.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are spending Christmas at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn between rounds of golf at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, the president announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, called service members to wish them a merry Christmas, and spoke to children while tracking Santa Claus' journey from the North Pole.\n\nHe also commented on the Jeffrey Epstein files for the first time since the Justice Department released images and documents on December 19 as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nThe Christmas holiday marks Trump's 16th visit to Mar-a-Lago in 2025. He is expected to remain in Palm Beach through January 4.\n\nTake a look at Mar-a-Lago's lavish Christmas celebrations.\n\nThe president flew to Palm Beach on Air Force One after holding a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First lady Melania Trump did not appear to be traveling with him.\n\nThe golf club is located around 4.5 miles from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJoined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that the \"Trump-class\" would eventually include 20 to 25 ships.\n\nPhelan said the first of these ships to be built will be the USS Defiant, an 880-foot-long, heavily armed battleship with a crew of 850. Some of its planned weaponry is still in development, such as the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear, or SLCM-N.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump also addressed the Epstein files for the first time since they were officially released on December 19.\n\nTrump acknowledged that he appeared in photos released by the Justice Department, saying that Epstein \"was all over Palm Beach and other places.\"\n\n\"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump rode through Palm Beach in \"The Beast,\" the armored presidential limousine.\n\nTrump thanked service members for their \"extraordinary devotion and service to America\" and touted his $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" bonus checks sent to military members ahead of Christmas.\n\nTrump moved gold angel statues from the ceiling of Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom to the doorways in the Oval Office, which he has redecorated to more closely resemble the gold-covered walls of his Palm Beach estate.\n\nThat night, Trump shared a holiday message on Truth Social.\n\n\"Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled. The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, says that he called off the performance in the wake of the White House announcing last week that President Donald Trump's name would be added to the facility.\n\nAs of last Friday, the building's facade reads The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision, which scholars have said violates the law. Trump had been suggesting for months he was open to changing the center's name.\n\n“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday “Jazz Jams” at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William “Keter” Betts.\n\nThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump's name from the building once he leaves office and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it, and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators. The changes at the Kennedy Center are part of the president's larger mission to fight “woke” culture at federal cultural institutions.\n\nNumerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of “Hamilton.”",

    "description": "The United States has slapped a fresh set of tariffs on Chinese electronic components, but their implementation has been delayed until 2027.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe U.S. has made its latest move in the global trade war. Based on the results of a new report, the Trump administration has announced a new round of tariffs on Chinese semiconductor products, though they won't take effect just yet. The de facto for the new tariff is June 23, 2027. The delayed implementation may be thanks to a recent and mild easing of tensions between the U.S. and China, as the Chinese government has itself recently delayed export restrictions on rare-earths products into next year.\n\nAt a technical level, per the U.S. Trade Representative notice, the tariffs are already in in place at a 0% rate, a figure that will increase in 18 months on June 23, 2027. The new rate will be known no later than 30 days before that date. Crucially, the new tariffs would be applied on top of the already-existing 50% tax on Chinese semiconductor imports that came into effect January 1 this year.\n\nIt's worth noting that while there's some overlap in the late, the tariff codes in the latest sanctions include section 8541 items including diodes, transistors, amplifiers, and optic couplers, but do not include the 8542 section covered by the January 1st tariffs, meaning that different components would have different tariff rates, and some would get hit with a double-strike.\n\nThe new tariffs are the result of a year-long survey launched by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which itself was part of an investigation into China's semiconductor production chain originally launched during the Biden administration. The resulting report has been made public and paints an interesting picture. This part of the investigation focused on \"legacy\" chips (usually 22nm and larger) and other components like op-amps, analog chips, and diodes — all components that are material to building most any electronic device.\n\nThe BIS compares the current over-reliance on Chinese semiconductors to the situation that took place during the COVID pandemic, where it became painfully obvious that far too many products relied on components that had a limited number of centralized sources. In this instance, the BIS found that \"across all respondents’ products, 66 percent (by revenue) contained or likely contained at least one chip manufactured by PRC-based foundries,\" with many respondents to even being able to pinpoint the source of those chips, or when they did, if they originated in the PRC.\n\nThe report claims that the situation is the results of \"non-market overcapacity and economic coercion.\" According to HoganLovells, the findings \"[point] to China’s industrial policy frameworks, including the Made in China 2025 initiative, which reportedly establishes specific numerical targets for domestic semiconductor production and capacity.\"",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's final rule on limiting eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is set to go into effect in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "Big changes are coming for a long-standing student-loan forgiveness program.\n\nIn 2007, Congress approved the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is designed to forgive student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of making qualifying payments. It meant that student-loan borrowers who dedicate at least a decade of their careers to public service work could count on their balances eventually being wiped out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is changing the popular program, in which about 7 million borrowers are enrolled. At the end of October, the Department of Education finalized its rule to narrow eligibility for PSLF in response to Trump's March executive order directing the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nA fact sheet from the department said that the rule will change the definition of a qualifying employer \"to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose.\"\n\nThe final rule is set to go into effect in July 2026, and some student-loan servicers that collect payments from borrowers in PSLF have said that nothing is changing yet, and borrowers will receive updates as the regulations go into effect.\n\n\"For now, there are no impacts to borrowers, payment counts, or discharges,\" one servicer, Aidvantage, posted on its website.\n\nThe Department of Education said that the changes are intended to ensure that borrowers who receive PSLF have employers that contribute to public service and do not violate any laws. However, borrowers and advocates have expressed concerns that the changes to eligibility will block public servants from relief because their employers do not align with the administration's political views.\n\n\"With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nThe key change in the PSLF rule concerns eligibility for PSLF employers. While any public service employer previously qualified for the program, a fact sheet from the Department of Education said that it will be changing the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" to exclude employers that have participated in \"substantial illegal activity,\" which the department said includes actions supporting terrorism or gender affirming care.\n\nIf the department determines that an employer engaged in illegal activity, affected employers will be notified and receive an opportunity to rebut the department's findings. Borrowers will also be notified, but they cannot appeal the findings themselves.\n\nShould the employer be disqualified from PSLF, they can reapply to be a qualifying employer within 10 years, or they can enter a \"corrective action plan\" with terms agreed upon by the department. Once an employer is deemed ineligible, any payments borrowers make while under that employer will not count toward PSLF, but retroactive payments would continue to be valid.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers in public service raised concerns with the looming PSLF changes. Megan Flocken, a nonprofit worker, told Business Insider: \"I'm counting my lucky stars that there's still the possibility that this PSLF program will remain intact because I have dedicated my whole professional life to public service.\"\n\nShortly after the department released its final rule, a coalition of advocates and nonprofits sued the administration, accusing it of violating the law and harming government and nonprofit recruitment. Some Democratic lawmakers also called for the rule to be rescinded; Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on X on November 1 that the administration does \"not have the right to take away student debt forgiveness from teachers, nurses, veterans and other public servants if they do not show loyalty to your right-wing political agenda.\"",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters is asking the state appeals court to recognize President Donald Trump's pardon of her state convictions as valid.\n\nIn a motion Tuesday, Peters' lawyers said the Colorado appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of a Dec. 5 pardon issued by Trump. They also asked the court to release her from prison because of the pardon.\n\nPeters, the former Mesa County, Colorado clerk, was convicted of state crimes there for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race. Trump’s pardon power does not extend to state crimes.\n\nIn the court filing, Peters' lawyers argued that President George Washington issued pardons to people convicted of both state and federal crimes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795. They urged the state appeals court to issue a ruling quickly. The court is set to hear arguments from lawyers in Peters' appeal of her conviction on Jan. 14.\n\nThe appeals court ruled Wednesday that lawyers from the state attorney general's office, which is defending the conviction, could respond to Peters’ arguments by Jan. 8.\n\nThe office of Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser declined to comment. Weiser previously dismissed it when Trump announced it Dec. 11.\n\n“The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up,” he said in statement then.\n\nIf the appeals court rules the pardon isn't valid, one of Peters' attorneys, Peter Ticktin, said she could appeal that issue to the U.S. Supreme Court while the state court continues to consider Peters' appeal of her conviction.\n\nAnother Peters attorney, John Case, has asked the state prison system to release Peters based on Trump's pardon but the state refused, according to an email included in the appeals court filing.\n\nEarlier this month, Peters lost a bid in federal court to be released from prison while her state appeal is considered.\n\nPeters claims that the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her for making allegations about election fraud.\n\nDuring Peters’ October 2024 sentencing, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a “charlatan” and said she posed a danger to the community for spreading lies about voting and undermining the democratic process.\n\nPeters was unapologetic and insisted that everything she did was geared toward trying to uproot what she believed was fraud. She claimed her actions were done for the greater good.\n\nPeters was convicted of allowing a man to misuse a security card to access the election system and being deceptive about that person’s identity. The man was affiliated with MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump.",

U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

    "fullText": "CBS News aired the Kennedy Center Honors on Tuesday using a sharply edited Donald Trump monologue and dodging his controversial “Trump Kennedy Center” rebrand.\n\nThe new Trump-appointed Kennedy Center board voted on Dec. 18 to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” leading to almost immediate legal action.\n\nDespite the 79-year-old president trying to muscle the rebrand into the country’s living rooms while hosting what he called “THE TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS” on Tuesday evening, CBS aired the 48th Kennedy Center Honors with the institution’s long-standing name, noted The Washington Post.\n\nBehind the scenes, the paper said CBS News standards had circulated guidance telling staff to stick with “Kennedy Center,” noting the board’s vote alone doesn’t make the change official because Congress would have to approve it.\n\nThe network also trimmed Trump’s opening remarks from roughly 12 minutes to about two minutes for viewers at home, cutting out some of his freewheeling asides—including his crack at the laughing crowd as “miserable, horrible people.”\n\nThe on-air snub came as CBS’s relationship with Trump has taken repeated hits, often with 60 Minutes at the center.\n\nIn July, Paramount, the network’s parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over what he claimed was deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a deal the company announced without an apology.\n\nSince then, Trump has continued his attack on the network, even as CBS has been accused of bending over backwards to placate him. In November, it aired a 28-minute version of a Trump 60 Minutes sit-down with Norah O’Donnell, as well as a separate 73-minute extended cut.\n\nYet it left out a tense exchange in which Trump expressed irritation over questions about a crypto mogul he pardoned amid reports of a $2 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto venture. The edits also omitted Trump’s comment about CBS’s payout related to the settlement.\n\nThen came the network’s leadership turmoil. After Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, 42, installed Bari Weiss, 41, as CBS News editor-in-chief in October, the MAGA-curious boss spiked a 60 Minutes segment at the eleventh hour last weekend.\n\nIt featured interviews with deportees sent by the Trump administration to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador, with Weiss claiming the segment needed more work before it could air. Her last-minute decision sparked concerns of White House interference and triggered fury inside the newsroom.\n\nThe episode spiraled further when the segment surfaced anyway after a Canadian broadcaster aired it, and Paramount Skydance began issuing copyright takedowns to scrub reposts.\n\nSet against concerns over political pressure and corporate leverage, the network’s refusal to call the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” on its biggest annual cultural broadcast—and cutting Trump’s screen time—has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted CBS and the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "fullText": "The US just escalated its clash with Europe over tech regulation.\n\nThe State Department said it has barred five Europeans, including the EU's former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and four members of digital campaign groups, from entering the country over what it called \"censorship\" of tech platforms.\n\nThe visa bans were met with backlash from European leaders on X, who accused Washington of intimidation and political overreach.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which imposes obligations on major tech platforms — many of which are based in the US — to police content and curb anti-competitive behavior. Companies in breach of it can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenue.\n\nIn a post on X late Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would block leading figures of what he called \"the global censorship-industrial complex\" from entering the US.\n\n\"For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,\" Rubio wrote. \"The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\"\n\nFor far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.

Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, named Breton among the five European individuals sanctioned, accusing him of using the EU's Digital Services Act to pressure Elon Musk and X during his tenure as commissioner for the internal market.\n\nShe also named Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, and HateAid co-CEOs Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, accusing them of pressuring US platforms over online speech. None of the four campaigners immediately responded to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nRubio added that the US was \"ready and willing to expand this list\" unless officials reversed course, framing the move as a defense of free expression and US sovereignty.\n\nThe back-and-forth has largely played out on X, a platform that was hit with a $140 million fine earlier this month for breaching the Digital Services Act.\n\nBreton responded in Tuesday X post by invoking McCarthy-era politics, asking, \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"\n\nHe added, \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is.'\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the visa restrictions, describing them in a Wednesday X post as coercive measures aimed at undermining Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n\"The rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission \"strongly\" condemned the US decision, adding that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market and would seek clarification from US authorities.\n\nIs McCarthy’s witch hunt back? 🧹\n\nAs a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA 🇪🇺\n\nTo our American friends: “Censorship isn’t where you think it is.”\n\n\"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"\n\nGérard Araud, France's former ambassador to the US, said the dispute reflects a deeper rupture, writing on X that \"the West\" no longer exists and that Europe is now alone in defending its interests and values.\n\nHodenberg and Ballon told Business Insider in a joint statement that they are \"not surprised\" by the move, calling it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever,\" the duo said.\n\nThe dispute has been years in the making — and Musk's X has often been at the center of it.\n\nMusk cheered the US move to sanction the officials, writing on X: \"This is so great.\"\n\nThis is so great 🤩 https://t.co/fXAfNbwEVf\n\nBreton repeatedly clashed with Musk after he bought Twitter in 2022 and pledged to loosen moderation in the name of free speech.\n\nAs the then-internal market commissioner, Breton warned that X could face fines or even be barred from the European Union if it failed to comply with EU law, later overseeing a formal investigation into the platform regarding disinformation and content moderation.\n\nThose confrontations turned X into a symbol of the broader transatlantic fight over who sets the rules for online speech — a conflict that has now spilled from regulation into geopolitics.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has attributed the recent uptick in the unemployment rate to a reduction in government jobs. He also highlighted that all new jobs are being created in the private sector.\n\nTrump, during the Most Favored Nation drug pricing press conference on Friday, acknowledged the rise in the unemployment rate but emphasized that “the only reason” it happened was due to a significant decrease in government jobs.\n\nHe underscored that the reduction of government jobs has been unprecedented and will continue.

The reduction in the overall federal workforce comes due to the government shutdown as well as Trump’s sweeping job cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nLeading economists and experts have raised concerns about the slowing U.S. labor market following the release of the November data. Economist Justin Wolfers said it is unclear whether the economy is already in a recession, but noted that employment trends point to a clear slowdown. He also stated that the economy created “zero jobs” since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. However, Wolfers’ claims could not be confirmed by data.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "A federal judge upheld the Trump administration's ability to place a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications.\n\nUS District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, DC, said in the opinion that President Donald Trump's order made on September 19 to hike visa fees \"rests on a straightforward reading of congressional statutes giving the President broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.\"\n\n\"Here, Congress has decided to delegate broad power to the President to restrict entry of noncitizens '[w]henever the President finds that\" such entry 'would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,'\" wrote Howell.\n\n\"To be clear, this decision in favor of defendants is not to dismiss or discount the past and ongoing contributions of H-1B workers to the American economy that plaintiffs highlight,\" Howell added. \"The effects of the H-1B program on the American economy or national security, whether positive or negative, are simply not at issue in this case.\"\n\nThe US Chamber of Commerce and Association of American Universities, which challenged the policy in court, can appeal the decision.\n\nIn the initial court filing asking for an immediate injunction on the visa fee hike, the plaintiffs argued that presidential powers do not sweep so far as to permit the president to \"rewrite a visa program by imposing an unprecedented fee on domestic employers, and purporting to deny entry only when those domestic employers are unable or unwilling to pay.\"\n\nTrump's presidential proclamation in September, said to prevent system \"abuses\" and to encourage companies to train American workers, sent major tech companies scrambling as they raced to decipher the new rules.\n\nThe Trump administration later clarified that the fee hike only applies to new visas.\n\nH-1B visas have become a mainstay of the tech industry, enabling companies to hire highly skilled workers.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump's newly appointed envoy to Greenland said Tuesday that the Republican administration is looking to begin a conversation with residents of the semi-autonomous Danish territory about the best way forward for the strategically important island.\n\nIn his first extended comments since being appointed to the role this week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the Trump administration isn't going to “go in there trying to conquer anybody\" or try to \"to take over anybody’s country.”\n\nThe governor's comments seemed somewhat at odds with Trump, who has repeatedly said the U.S. needs to take over the Arctic territory for the sake of U.S. security and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\n“Well, I think our discussions should be with the actual people in Greenland — the Greenlanders,” Landry said in an appearance on Fox News' “The Will Cain Show.” “What are they looking for? What opportunities have they not gotten? Why haven’t they gotten the protection that they actually deserve?”\n\nTrump's announcement of Landry's appointment has once again stirred anxiety in Denmark and Europe.\n\nDenmark’s foreign minister told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to his ministry.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement Monday. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland during his presidential transition and in the early months of his second term. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of under-investing there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nThe Trump administration did not offer any warning ahead of the announcement of Landry's appointment, according to a Danish government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe administration also has yet to provide any details about the appointment to Congress, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump is renewing the Greenland debate at a moment when he has no shortage of foreign policy crises to dealing with, including maintaining a fragile truce in Gaza and negotiating an end to Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of “picking fights with friends” at such a difficult moment around the globe.\n\n“Greenland’s sovereignty is not up for debate,” Shaheen said. \"Denmark is a critical NATO ally that has stood side by side with the U.S.”",

    "title": "December Was Deadliest Month in Deadliest Year in ICE Custody Deaths",
    "description": "There has been an alarming spike in immigrants dying while in ICE detention during the Trump administration.",
    "fullText": "It’s official: December was the deadliest month for immigrants in ICE custody since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for those in ICE custody since 2004. In December, that trend continued, with seven immigrants dying in ICE detention, including four that died within a four day span, according to death notices published by ICE. Three of the deceased were held at facilities in Texas before they died. Four of the deceased died within four days of each other.\n\nFrancisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala died on December 3, after being held at Camp East Montana in Texas since September. In his notice, ICE noted that although his “cause of death is pending, medical staff attributed it to natural liver and kidney failure.” The new detention facility at Fort Bliss has reportedly already violated dozens of federal standards for immigrant detention since welcoming detainees in August.\n\nPete Sumalo Montejo, a 72-year-old Filipino man who was previously convicted of child sexual abuse, died on December 5 at the Montgomery Processing Center in Texas. ICE reported that Montejo had suffered a number of illnesses throughout his time in custody: In June he was admitted for shortness of breath and hypoxia, and between July and November he was hospitalized several times for illnesses such as anemia and septic shock resulting from pneumonia.\n\nShiraz Fatehali Sachwani, a 48 year-old man from Pakistan, died on December 6, after being held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, since June. He was admitted to the hospital in November after experiencing low oxygen levels and tachycardia.\n\nJean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian man detained at Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, died on December 12 from “suspected natural causes.” Immigrants held at Delaney Hall previously said that they were starved.\n\nFouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean man, died in ICE custody December 14 at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. Abdulkadir’s sudden death is reportedly the second to occur at that facility this year, and is currently being investigated by Pennsylvania State Police and the Clearfield County coroner.\n\nDelvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old man from Nicaragua was pronounced dead on December 14, just one day after he was scheduled to be deported. He was discovered unresponsive and without a pulse at the Adams County Detention Center in Colorado on December 4, removed to a medical facility, and declared dead 10 days later.\n\nNenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old man from Bulgaria, died in ICE custody December 15 at the North Lake Processing Center in Michigan. While ICE wrote that they suspected he died of natural causes, his cause of death is under investigation.\n\nICE’s webpage dedicated to Detainee Death Reporting lists only 15 deaths in 2025—not including any from this month. However, at least 20 immigrants had already died in ICE custody as of October, according to NPR.\n\nICE is required to publish information about an in-custody death within 30 days.\n\nPresident Trump plans on ringing in the New Year by garnishing the wages of over 5 million student debtors currently in default on their loans, The Washington Post first reported.\n\nStarting January 7, the Department of Education plans to withhold a portion of the wages of around 1,000 defaulted borrowers. The number will gradually increase within the following months.\n\nNo, JD Vance will not be our first “Chad” president.\n\nThe vice president shared a series of photographs to X Monday showing himself valiantly running physical training drills with Navy Seals at Base Coronado, in California. Vance was photographed running down the beach, carrying a heavy log, climbing a large cargo net, and even rowing. Another set of photographs showed him speaking with officers, and posing for a photograph in front of a large American flag.\n\n“They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train,” Vance wrote on X, recapping his 90-minute PT session. “So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!” Vance previously served a four-year stint in the public affairs section in the 2nd Marine Aircraft.\n\nObviously, Vance’s critics were not impressed.\n\n“Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks,” Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, wrote on X.\n\n“It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL,” Christopher Hale, a former Democratic congressional candidate, wrote on X.\n\nEven Vance couldn’t help but make fun of himself. He shared an edited version of the photograph that included his bloated, meme-ified face.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what prompted Vance’s recent cosplaying adventure. Perhaps it has something to do with his recent presidential endorsement from Erika Kirk, a closely-held friend of the vice president. Or maybe it has something to do with his slipping poll numbers.\n\nA recent survey by AtlasIntel found that while Vance was still the leading pick to become the Republican nominee in 2028, a majority of Republicans no longer support him. Only 46.7 percent of respondents said they would pick Vance over other figures, down from 54.6 percent in a September poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a straw poll taken by Fox News at Turning Point USA’s Amerifest this past weekend found that 84.2 percent of respondents said they would like to see Vance as the Republican nominee in 2028, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis trailing far behind him. In order to claim the full support of MAGA, it seems Vance may have decided it’s time to prove himself more than a sniveling debate kid.\n\nThe Justice Department is now downplaying the Epstein files they took so long to release by claiming that they’re full of “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.”\n\n“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein,” the DOJ wrote Tuesday on X. “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”\n\n“Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”\n\nWhile there certainly is some uncorroborated information in the files, there is also a wealth of new, possibly incriminating evidence about President Trump. One file contains an email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 that reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\nAnother file contained a 2019 letter from Epstein addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he said, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nEven as more information rolls in, it should come as no surprise that the Justice Department—which has been completely subservient to the president—continues to provide cover for him even as they release the heavily redacted files.\n\n“‘We’re releasing the documents, but please know in advance they’re fake, irrelevant, already debunked, totally harmless, and also important enough to issue a press statement about,’” one conservative X user posted. “If the DOJ tells you what to think before you read the documents, you already know they’re lying.”\n\nA bunch of masked male Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in tactical gear broke into the women’s bathroom of Cato nutrition bar factory in New York, even forcing a stall open while a woman in there used the toilet. They can be heard telling her to pull her pants up.\n\nICE agents illegally break into a woman's bathroom in a NY nutrition bar manufacturing plant. \"Pull up your pants,\" says a male agent. The agents only had a warrant to review employer documents. They didn't have a warrant to search for, detain, or arrest anyone there. pic.twitter.com/CnsGwkJzG4\n\nThe raid occurred in September, but the troubling footage was just recently revealed in court filings.\n\nThe officers justified their invasive actions by telling Cato’s owners that they had a warrant for a violent felon. In reality, the warrant they did have only allowed them to go into the building and seize documents, not kidnap a woman while she was on the toilet.\n\nICE eventually detained and questioned 57 people, even those who asked for a lawyer. At least 21 were deported and separated from their families.\n\n“I guess we found the men going into women’s bathrooms,” one X user mused.\n\nThe government found a photograph of Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Steve Bannon’s phone. So, why did they redact it?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Department of Justice Monday, one email appeared to be from a federal investigator who said they’d discovered something while digging through Bannon’s iPhone 7.\n\n“As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon’s phone,” the email stated, passing it forward “in case it was of any importance” to someone handling “both cases.”\n\n“Thanks very much for flagging—no need to do anything on this one,” the person responds.\n\nDespite the fact that the Epstein Files Transparency Act only required the Trump administration to redact identifiable information of survivors—something that the government failed to do—the photograph of Trump and Maxwell was redacted in its entirety in the DOJ’s release. The sender and recipients’ names have also all been redacted.\n\nSo, what is it about this photograph in particular that warranted redaction?\n\nOver the course of his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was photographed several times with Maxwell. The two attended parties and fashion events, and even traveled together.\n\nIt seems that Trump may be receiving some special treatment. In other photographs released as part of the government’s document dumps, former President Bill Clinton’s face remained visible while the faces of some other individuals were redacted. The DOJ even went so far as to release a statement to get ahead of the “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump contained in their own release.\n\nThe batch of files released Monday contained multiple disturbing revelations, including one email that suggested Trump flew on Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported,” and Epstein’s apparent suicide note that mentioned Trump’s love of “young, nubile girls.”\n\nEpstein files leaked on Monday night confirmed what so many people already suspected: President Trump spent much more time with Epstein—and young women—than he’s said he has.\n\nAn email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\n“He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was present,” the attorney continued, noting that Trump brought his wife, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany at times.\n\nOn one flight, the only three listed passengers were Trump,  Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name has been redacted, likely a victim of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThis email completely undermines Trump’s various stories regarding his friendship with Epstein, from saying that he viewed Epstein as some kind of creep to be kept at arm’s length, to saying he barely knew him. Regardless of how their relationship ended, the president was flying around on a private jet with a sexual predator who abused children—which explains the lengths the administration went to keep these files from coming out even as a notable portion of their voter base recognized it as an issue.\n\nIt will be interesting to hear Trump and his helpers explain this one. Why would Trump fly on the sex trafficker’s plane multiple times? Did he just not know then too?\n\n“Trump was on Epstein’s plane, with Epstein victims,” one X user wrote. “Yet another reason why he was trying to keep the Epstein files from ever seeing the light of day.”\n\nWhat do Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar, and Donald Trump all have in common?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Justice Department Monday, a postcard addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls, mentioned Trump by name—and more.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote in the alleged letter, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he continued, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nThe government also released an image of the envelope, which was addressed from Epstein to “inmate” Nassar, and was postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York City. The letter, marked as return to sender, was addressed to Nassar at USP Arizona, where the high-profile pedophile had been held before he was transferred in 2018.\n\nLikely recognizing the harm that this letter’s authenticity would inflict on the president, the Department of Justice quickly announced \nTuesday morning that they would investigate its legitimacy. Less than two hours later they declared the FBI has concluded the note is a “FAKE”, citing the handwriting, postmark date, and an incorrect return address format for inmates. However, the DOJ did not choose to publish the results of the handwriting analysis originally obtained in July 2020, when establishing its authenticity would have been pertinent to a potential wrongful death suit based upon Epstein’s in-custody death.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Epstein attempted to reach out to Nassar, but that his letter had been returned. The government’s documents suggest that the letter was first discovered weeks later in September 2019, and was submitted for a handwriting analysis in July 2020. It’s not clear what the results of the writing test were.\n\nThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice mention Trump’s name hundreds of times. One 2020 email sent by a federal prosecutor asserted that Trump had flown on Epstein’s private jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).”\n\nThe previous batch of documents published Friday were heavily criticized for being incomplete. While the government made sweeping redactions to entire pages of documents, it apparently failed to redact the names of multiple survivors.\n\nJust days after plastering his name onto the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Trump will be naming a new class of battleships after himself.\n\nTrump is planning to make the naming announcement of the Navy’s new battleships alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday. An anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times that Trump will call them “Trump-class” battleships.\n\nThe ship will be part of Trump’s vision of a new “Golden Fleet.” Each ship is expected to cost at least $5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs The New Republic’s Matt Ford wrote earlier this week—as bleak as the Gulf of America, the Trump Kennedy Center, the War Department, and others sound, Trump won’t be president forever. If he can change them just that easily, there’s no reason the next Democratic administration should hesitate to change them back.\n\nCBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss told 60 Minutes producers she was killing their story on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador, where Trump deported more than 250 Venezuelan immigrants,  because it did “not present the administration’s argument.”\n\n“What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing?” Weiss wrote in a Sunday memo. “Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.”\n\nWeiss’s decision to kill the story because it didn’t have enough perspective from DHS officials—who had already declined to speak with 60 Minutes—was met with uproar when it was leaked on Monday. But she doubled down.\n\n“We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,” she said on a Monday staffing call, insinuating that the testimonies of CECOT inmates were insufficient.\n\nKilling a story about a brutal megaprison because the folks that are sending people to the brutal megaprison aren’t featured prominently enough has not been favorably received.\n\n“The Trump administration sent dozens [of] young men with no criminal record to be tortured and abused in a foreign prison,” podcaster Jon Favreau wrote. “@bariweiss can keep reporting, delaying, or kill the story altogether, but the basic facts have been well-documented in multiple court cases, including by Trump’s own DOJ and Trump-appointed judges.”\n\n“Bari Weiss’s main criticism is that 60 Minutes doesn’t advance the story,” writer Randye Hoder chimed. “But her solution is to ask Stephen Miller to regurgitate the same talking points this admin has given from the get-go, which we’ve heard a gazillion times)!”\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to comment. View the trailer for the scrapped segment here.\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y",

    "description": "Photos show Greenland's culture, which has both Inuit and Danish influences. Its industry, cuisine, and more are shaped by the weather and history.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to acquire Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory.\n\nThe president resurfaced the issue this week by appointing Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump told the BBC that acquiring the island is necessary for \"national protection,\" adding, \"We have to have it.\"\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told TV2 that the appointment was \"completely unacceptable.\" Denmark said it will summon the US ambassador to explain.\n\nEarlier this year, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, traveled to the island. Following criticism from Denmark and Greenlanders over the trip, the Vances' itinerary was amended so they only visited the US military base on Greenland, a change the Danish government called \"very positive.\"\n\nGreenland is known for its long, freezing winters, stunning glaciers, and fishing industry, but in many ways, it remains a frozen mystery to much of the world.\n\nPart of that mystique is because it's been difficult for some tourists to travel to, except by cruise ship or lengthy plane rides. A new international airport is making the country more accessible, including to US residents.\n\nMarianne A. Stenbaek, a professor of cultural studies at McGill University who studies Greenlandic art and literature, described Greenland as a \"modern society with a traditional touch.\" That's because Denmark colonized it hundreds of years ago, but aspects of its Inuit traditions remain.\n\nFrom its arts to its cuisine, Greenland has a culture all its own.\n\nThe country is a little bigger than Mexico. It's also much colder. About 80% of Greenland's 836,330 square miles are buried in snow and ice. An enormous national park, the world's largest, covers much of the northeast.\n\nThe island has long made it of interest to many other countries for military purposes and as a source of natural resources, from rare minerals to natural gas and oil.\n\nBut to Greenlanders, it's simply home.\n\nPre-Inuit groups, including members of the Saqqaq culture, came to the island around 2,500 BCE via Canada. They settled in northern, western, and southeastern Greenland. Today's Greenland Inuit population is descended from the Thule people, who moved into the country's north from Alaska through Canada around 1,000 years ago.\n\nBetween 985 and roughly 1450 CE, Vikings lived and then died out in Western Greenland. Erik the Red was the one who called the icy island Greenland. In Greenlandic, its name is Kalaallit Nunaat.\n\nDanish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede established a settlement in what's now Nuuk, Greenland's capital, in 1721. Over the centuries, Denmark's culture profoundly changed the country.\n\nGreenland remained a Danish colony until 1953 and became an autonomous territory in 1979. It has its own parliament, known as the Inatsisartut.\n\nWhile the country self-governs its domestic matters, Denmark retains jurisdiction over defense and foreign affairs.\n\nAround 56,000 people make Greenland their home.\n\nJust under 90% are Inuit, though most also have some European ancestry, according to genetic testing published by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2015. Danish people make up the rest of the population. Most live in coastal cities or communities.\n\nKalaallisut, also known as Greenlandic, is an Inuit language and is the official language of the country. It's widely spoken, though some groups in the east speak Tunumiit, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nMost residents also speak Danish, which is taught as a second language in schools.\n\nThe population has long depended on fishing for their livelihoods. However, it's not enough to support the entire country. Denmark heavily supplements its budget with about $511 million annually, according to The BBC.\n\n\"The economy has been difficult,\" Stenbaek said. Tourism and the country's natural resources may be its future.\n\nWhether they're hoping to spot narwhals or want to glimpse glaciers, nature-loving tourists are drawn to Greenland.\n\nFor a long time, it was difficult to get to the island by plane. Nuuk only opened its international airport in November 2024. Before that, only a few airports had runways long enough to land large jets. But as of earlier this year, Americans can hop on a direct flight from New York to Nuuk.\n\nIlulissat, which has an ice fjord on UNESCO's World Heritage list, and Qaqortoq are also getting international airports, Reuters reported.\n\nTo get ready for the surge of tourists, some residents are buying snowmobiles to rent out, The New York Times reported. New hotels are opening, too.\n\nGreenland has a history of mining cryolite, which is used in aluminum smelting. A recent documentary, \"The White Gold of Greenland,\" claimed that for over 100 years, Danish mining companies extracted billions worth of the mineral, and Greenland reaped very little of the benefit, Variety reported.\n\nThat's not a history it would want to repeat if it taps its deposits of uranium, gold, natural gas, lithium, and other resources. While some see mining as an opportunity to enrich the country, others have concerns.\n\n\"Greenlanders are very hesitant about many aspects of mining because it impacts the nature so much,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThere are also worries about how it could affect the fishing industry, while residents in Narsaq are concerned about their health if a company moves forward with mining radioactive uranium at a nearby proposed site, The Guardian reported.\n\nDanish culture is visible in Greenland's healthcare system, educational institutions, and government. \"To that extent, it has had a huge impact,\" Stenbaek said. At the same time, authorities contributed to the loss of many aspects of the Inuits' way of life.\n\nBetween the 1950s and '70s, the Danish government forced Inuit populations to relocate from smaller settlements and communities to cities, Reuters reported. During this time, doctors implanted IUDs in thousands of Inuit girls and women, sometimes without their consent, The BBC reported. Denmark is investigating the matter and has offered counseling to those affected, AP reported last year.\n\nMembers of the Inuit community were also pressured to give up their culture and language.\n\n\"We were told to act more Danish, to speak Danish, if we wanted to be something,\" Nadja Arnaaraq Kreutzmann, a Nuuk resident, recently told Reuters.\n\nFrom sewing national costumes to making jewelry to carving animal tusks, Inuit people in Greenland are finding ways to continue traditional practices.\n\n\"I'm concerned if we do not give the old traditions to younger people, it'll die out within 35 years,\" Greenlander Vera Mølgaard told National Geographic.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a new member of Greenland's Parliament, has spent over five years gaining more than 320,000 Instagram followers by highlighting the country's food and traditions.\n\nSome estimates put Greenland's Lutheran population at 90%, heavily influenced by Hans Egede, the missionary who came to the island in 1721. His statue stands in Nuuk, and some want it removed, saying it's a symbol of the start of colonization, the AP reported.\n\nMany Greenlanders incorporate traditional religious practices into their services, Stenbaek said. They also sing hymns in Greenlandic, she said.\n\nThe city's architecture is Scandinavian, but its artwork incorporates Inuit tales, according to Lonely Planet. That duality is Nuuk in a nutshell.\n\n\"It's very much, in many ways, like a modern Scandinavian city,\" Stenbaek said. \"And at the same time, the Greenlandic culture, the traditional culture, is still there.\"\n\nThere are plenty of cafés, restaurants, and shopping for residents and tourists to visit.\n\nSmall settlements remain along the west and east coasts, Stenbaek said. Some have fewer than 100 people.\n\n\"They live very much like they would have lived 100 years ago,\" Stenbaek said. That means relying on fishing and other traditional knowledge to survive.\n\nIn the more remote areas of the country, it's not always easy to get from place to place.\n\n\"If you have to go from settlement to settlement, it's either by boat or dog sleigh or skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIf the water is too icy for boats, Greenlanders might have to jump in a helicopter. There are dog sled races in Uummannaq, but it's also a practical mode of transportation in the snowy weather. The same goes for snowmobiles.\n\nFar north regions experience polar nights in the winter, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. The opposite happens in the summer, when Greenland gets nonstop daylight for a couple of months.\n\nBoth are significant to Greenlanders.\n\nSince the sun is not visible in the winter, when spring comes it brings life back,\" photographer Inuuteq Storch told The Guardian in 2024. \"That time of total darkness is very spiritual.\"\n\nGreenland is a maritime culture, according to Stenbaek. \"Everything depends on ice and water,\" she said.\n\nIn some parts of the country, winters can last through April. The temperatures can be frigid, with some regions getting down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSummers in northern towns are still chilly, averaging around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, per The Guardian. Temperatures are getting warmer, though.\n\nPlenty of Greenlanders' pastimes involve braving the cold.\n\n\"Many of them are connected directly to nature, like fishing, hunting, skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThe snowy landscape and arctic waters surrounding the island are habitats for musk ox, reindeer, seals, polar bears, whales, and dozens of bird species.\n\nBerries, flowers, and cottongrass also grow in some parts of the country.\n\nSled dogs aren't just companions. They're often working animals, and have a long history of surviving alongside humans. Greenland's first dogs arrived with the Thule people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe husky-like dogs have thick coats, muscular bodies for pulling sleds, and a digestive system suited to high-fat diets, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nSome dog sled races ban the use of other breeds, according to the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nLong before there were grocery stores in Greenland, locals survived by hunting and fishing. Since the island doesn't have a lot of plant life, they got their vitamin C from whale skin, The New York Times reported.\n\nEven today, there isn't much farming in Greenland, though people do raise sheep in the south.\n\nWhile supermarkets sell imported food, like milk and vegetables, they'll also stock local fare, including fish, seal, and whale. Some Greenlanders also supplement their shopping by hunting reindeer, ox, and other animals.\n\n\"In Greenland, we have the world's wildest kitchen,\" chef Inunnguaq Hegelund recently told NPR.\n\nAs the planet heats up, Greenland has started to melt. Its glaciers are shrinking, and the permafrost is disappearing. In 2016, researchers found that the Greenland ice sheet was losing the equivalent of 110 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water each year.\n\n\"It had an influence on roads and airports and houses when all of a sudden the earth starts to unfreeze,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIt's started to change animals' migration patterns, and polar bears have had to adapt to a new way of hunting without sea ice.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation has been studying Greenland's ice sheet for decades.\n\nThe country's location also makes it the perfect location to obtain ice cores, test cold-weather engineering, monitor climate change, and study the elusive Greenland shark.\n\nOver the years, Greenland has become increasingly independent from Denmark. In 2008, it voted for a referendum granting them more autonomy. Many want to go even further and become completely independent from the Danish kingdom.\n\nAbout 80% of Greenlanders support the move, according to recent polling. Yet one longtime backer of the movement has recently become a bit more hesitant.\n\nAqqaluk Lynge is the former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a nongovernmental organization representing Inuit people in several countries. He told NPR in February 2025 that he now supports Greenland staying tied to Denmark because \"if Greenland secedes from Denmark, it will be taken by United States.\"\n\n\"This is surprising because Aqqaluk used to be head of much of the independence movement,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to buy Greenland. In a speech to the US Congress earlier this year, he said that if Greenland chose to join, \"we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nIt may be one of the reasons the Democratic party, which advocates for a slow approach to independence, won in recent elections, Stenbaek said. The majority of Greenlanders, 85%, according to a January 2025 opinion poll, don't want to become part of the US.\n\n\"Greenlanders want to remain Greenlandic,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nShe said she thought it was important for Greenland to strengthen connections with other countries, Canada in particular. They have a lot in common in terms of environmental concerns and large Inuit populations, she said.\n\n\"Both are Arctic countries,\" she said. \"They would be quite strong.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s nemesis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has registered the highest approval rating among current political leaders, a new poll has revealed.\n\nA Gallup survey shows that Powell—whom Trump has long berated while demanding interest-rate cuts—is more highly regarded by Americans than the president, members of Trump’s Cabinet, and leading Democratic figures.\n\nThe poll shows Powell’s approval rating at 44 percent, compared with Trump’s second-term low of 36 percent. The president’s current approval is only slightly above his all-time low of 34 percent, recorded in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is the only other political figure in the poll to break 40 percent, with an approval rating of 41 percent.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (28 percent) and Senate GOP Leader John Thune (34 percent) post the lowest ratings, with Vice President JD Vance (39 percent), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (36 percent), House Speaker Mike Johnson (35 percent), and embattled Attorney General Pam Bondi (36 percent) also registering uninspiring numbers.\n\nTrump is likely to be particularly irritated by how Americans view Powell. The president has repeatedly called for Powell to resign—at times even suggesting he could fire him as chair of the U.S. central bank—while unleashing a steady stream of insults.\n\nTrump has spent months attacking Powell as “stupid,” a “dummy,” and a “knucklehead” for refusing to slash interest rates to offset the president’s economically damaging tariff policies. The president was so blinded by rage at Powell’s refusal to bow to his demands that he appeared to have forgotten that it was he who appointed him in the first place.\n\n“He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July, despite nominating Powell in 2017.\n\nThat same month, the pair’s fractured relationship had an excruciating moment when Powell corrected Trump to his face after the president falsely claimed that renovation costs at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters totaled $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump suggested the figure had “just come out” when Powell questioned its source. After reviewing a piece of paper Trump handed him, Powell pushed back and explained that Trump was “adding a third building” to the total that “was built five years ago.”\n\n“It’s part of the overall work,” Trump insisted, prompting Powell to reply again: “It’s not new.”\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, has since cut interest rates three times this year as the central bank attempts to kick-start a struggling economy during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe most recent cut of 0.25 percentage points occurred on Dec. 10, lowering the benchmark rate to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

A combined 29 percent said they either somewhat or strongly disapproved of her work.\n\nBondi, 60, has angered MAGA loyalists this year by constantly fumbling the release of the Epstein files.\n\nAfter drip-feeding some heavily redacted documents, with the latest batch arriving on Friday, a statement by 19 of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims called out Bondi and her department, stating, “We are told that there are hundreds and thousands of pages of documents still unreleased. These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nThe poll asked their support base to rank their priorities, with winning next year’s midterms a clear winner at 63.9 percent.\n\n“Defunding woke universities” was only voted as an issue by 1.1 percent, while the base was least interested in ending the war in Ukraine, which came last.\n\n89.5 percent of voters also said they would support a moratorium on new immigration into the U.S.\n\nThe poll also saw the vice president blitz the choice of who Turning Point USA supporters would like to see succeed Trump in 2028.\n\n“JD Vance won the 2028 nomination straw poll by more than Donald Trump won the 2024 one we did two years ago,” Charlie Kirk Show producer Blake Neff wrote on X.\n\nVance, who has regularly attended Turning Point events and spoken about his faith, scored 84.2 percent of the vote. Rubio took just 4.8 percent while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earned a measly 2.9 percent. Donald Trump Jr. scored even less, with just 1.8 percent of the vote.\n\n88.3 percent of poll respondents self-identified as Republicans and 94.7 percent identified as conservatives.\n\nKolvet said the Turning Point “movement” is “all-in” for Vance as the next Republican leader.\n\nDuring the event on Sunday, Vance was cautious to fully condemn the rise of racism and antisemitism in the Republican Party.\n\nThe VP said conservatives should welcome everyone as long as they “love America.” He also said he was against using “purity tests” to work out who might be excluded from the religious movement over their beliefs, after questions arose over divisive figures such as Nick Fuentes and Candace Owens.\n\n“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during his closing speech on Sunday.\n\n“We don’t care if you’re white or Black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,” he said of Turning Point’s entry policy.\n\n“We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said.\n\nVance was more vocal about the Trump administration’s policies to end diversity and inclusion, telling the audience, “In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”",

    "description": "Europe still wants and needs to work with Trump. But this year’s made it clear they’re increasingly on their own.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s first year back in office shattered any remaining illusions among European leaders that he can be managed or controlled.\n\nHis open hostility toward the European Union has strained a transatlantic alliance that’s endured since World War II and deepened rifts between Europe’s national leaders and within the bloc, imperiling its ability to respond to Trump’s threats and taunts with the kind of unity and strength he respects.\n\nThat’s left Ukraine’s fate hanging in the balance heading into 2026, not to mention unanswered existential questions about European security at a moment when many fear Russian President Vladimir Putin’s territorial aims extend further westward beyond Ukraine.\n\nBut in many ways, Europe has survived the roller coaster — for now.\n\n“The Europeans cannot afford to cut ties and to hand in the divorce papers because they are still too dependent, especially when it comes to security and an American military commitment to defending Europe,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut, she continued, the efforts by leaders to maintain solid ties with the U.S. based on short- term interests do not mean the past year hasn’t clarified that the long-term interests are, for the moment, no longer aligned.\n\n“We need to be pretty clear-eyed,” she said. “In the old days, there was a clear mainstream understanding of the old transatlantic relationship enshrined by the Western values and norms and principles, the rules based international order. And now I think we see a competing project emerging.”\n\nThe administration is clear-eyed, too, heading into the new year.\n\nIt sees a continent losing its values and identity, beholden to liberal ideals that are doing far more to imperil European security than any missive from the White House. The act of a friend, the White House argues — as it pushes Europe to spend more on its own defense, restrict immigration and end the war in Ukraine — is to set it straight.\n\n“President Trump has great relationships with many European leaders, but he never shies away from delivering hard truths,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"The devastating impacts of unchecked migration, and those migrants’ inability to assimilate, are not just a concern for President Trump, but for Europeans themselves, who have increasingly noted immigration as one of their top concerns. These open border policies have led to widespread examples of violence, spikes in crime, and more, with detrimental impacts on the fiscal sustainability of social safety net programs.”\n\nAfter a blistering start to the year with Vice President JD Vance lecturing Europe over free speech in Munich and then tag-teaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Europeans have adjusted to Trump’s worldview — a shift, as Romania’s Nicușor Dan described it, from a “moral way of doing things to a very pragmatic and economical way of doing things” — and succeeded at bringing the White House back into the fold on several fronts.\n\nThe EU’s submission on trade, accepting a new tariff of 15 percent, limited the short-term economic damage. NATO appeased Trump with its pledge to boost defense spending by 5 percent over the next decade, cemented at its June summit — thanks largely to allowing existing, non-defense spending to count for 1.5 percent of that new total.\n\nInstead of abandoning Ukraine, Trump agreed in July to provide additional defense aid for its war with Russia as long as Europe pays for it. And Europeans have been able to withstand Trump’s August meeting with Putin in Alaska and the administration’s announcement of a 28-point peace plan crafted in secret with the Kremlin, which they have worked with the U.S. and Ukraine to revise.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Trump blasted European leaders as “weak,” asserting that they “don’t know what to do” about immigration in particular. He questioned whether European leaders should continue to be allies, saying that “it depends” on their policies and that he wouldn’t hesitate to intervene in European elections to back far-right parties challenging the very coalitions and leaders he’s currently working with.\n\nThat coincided with the issuing of a new National Security Strategy that called for “cultivating resistance” to European centrism that’s committing “civilizational suicide” and expressed disdain for the European Union, which the administration labeled as “adverse” to U.S. economic interests.”\n\nConstanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, called the Europe sections of the new NSS a “game changer” for leaders across the Atlantic that has “permanently changed” long-term strategy with the U.S.\n\n“It shouldn't be underestimated how much of a shock it was for European leaders and publics to read the Europe chapter of the National Security Strategy and to see put in writing that this administration thinks of Europe, or European political centrists, as unreliable allies and is taking such an adversarial one against them,” she said. “For 2026, we need to buckle up and plan for the worst on all counts. We have obvious vulnerabilities, and those are going to be exploited.”\n\nTrump is also ending the year by reminding Europe of his brazen desire, outlined in his first term and again shortly before his second inauguration, to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a reliable NATO ally whose per capita defense spending is among the highest of all member nations. On Saturday, he appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, a job that Landry said would focus on efforts to “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\n“This is shattering for a lot of the countries who thought that there was nothing safer than their bilateral relationship with the United States,” Stelzenmüller said.\n\nWhile openly threatening Denmark, the administration has worked to drive a wedge into the European Union by suggesting that countries would get better trade deals by splitting from the 27-nation bloc and engaging with the White House bilaterally.\n\n“At the end of the year, the fundamental question facing the Europeans is whether they think tactical victories are enough to win the strategic war, which is to maintain the transatlantic alliance that’s stood for eight decades,” said Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who earlier this month declared the “Pax Americana” to be dead, seemed open to the possibility, saying last week that it’s become “quite obvious” that Trump “cannot relate” to the EU and that “at least there are individual member states, including Germany first and foremost, of course, with which such cooperation can continue.”\n\nMerz led a failed push in Brussels last week for the EU to repurpose $200 billion in seized Russian assets in a loan to Ukraine when Belgium, Italy and others balked. But he ultimately succeeded with a back-up plan of sorts, as the EU approved a $90 billion loan for Ukraine aimed at sustaining its military on the battlefield for two more years. Three Trump-aligned leaders in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opted out of the loan but did not block its passage.\n\nWhile Trump quietly opposed the EU effort to shore up Ukraine’s war chest, Europeans have mostly supported his diplomatic efforts to end the war, pushing for stronger security guarantees to ensure Ukraine survives long-term. Finnish President Alexander Stubb appeared Sunday on Fox News to declare that Trump’s efforts have helped advance the talks “closer [to a peace deal] than at any time of this war,” a comment seemingly aimed at the proverbial audience of one and only loosely grounded in what most European leaders actually believe.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has accused The New York Times of being a national security threat in an unhinged Truth Social post.\n\n“The Failing New York Times, and their lies and purposeful misrepresentations, is a serious threat to the National Security of our Nation,” Trump wrote in a late-night social media meltdown.\n\n“Their Radical Left, Unhinged Behavior, writing FAKE Articles and Opinions in a never-ending way, must be dealt with and stopped. THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DJT.”\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Trump’s latest attack on the newspaper he has long derided as part of the “fake news” media.\n\nHowever, the president and the White House were triggered for days over a November report in the Times revealing that the 79-year-old president has drastically reduced his public appearances compared to his first term.\n\nTrump, who is on track to become the oldest sitting U.S. president to date, is also starting his days later on average and working shorter hours than he did during his first stint in the White House, the Times reported.\n\nLast week, the paper also published a detailed report examining Trump’s friendship with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, describing how the two “pursued women in a game of ego and dominance” in which “female bodies were currency.”\n\nIn one particularly damaging section, a mother who accompanied her 14-year-old daughter to a party at Mar-a-Lago with other young models claimed she was warned by Trump’s then-wife, Marla Maples: “Whatever you do, do not let her around any of these men, and especially my husband.” Maples denied making the remark to the Times.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Times during a Monday press conference, accusing the paper of insufficiently covering his plan to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe president ranted about the outlet while continuing to push a dubious claim that he had lowered the cost of prescription drugs by the mathematically impossible amount of up to “3,000 percent.”\n\n“A drug that sells for $10 in London is costing $130 in New York. We’re bringing it down to $20,” Trump said. “So we’re going down—you can do your own math, but it’s 2,000 percent, 3,000 percent. It’s pretty amazing. And, you know, the New York Times had a story about it, a small story, way in the back of the paper. It’s the single biggest thing to happen with respect to drugs probably in 50 years.\n\n“It’s the biggest thing ever to happen, and it’s barely covered in the New York Times because it’s a fake newspaper,” Trump added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted The New York Times for comment.",

Epstein\" addressed to Larry Nassar, the disgraced Team USA gymnastics doctor who sexually abused scores of women and girls, appeared to reference then-President Donald Trump and claimed the president loved \"young, nubile girls.\"\n\nThe note, apparently handwritten by Jeffrey Epstein while he was in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges, was postmarked on Aug. 13, 2019, three days after the disgraced financier was found dead by suicide in his cell.\n\nThe note, addressed to \"L.N.,\" seems to reference Epstein's intention to die by suicide.\n\n\"As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home,\" the note reads. \"Good luck! We share one thing … our love & caring for young ladies at the hope they’d reach their full potential.\"\n\nThough the note does not mention Trump by name, it does appear to reference him, as he was president at the time of Epstein's death.\n\n\"Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls,\" the note reads. \"When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J. Epstein.\"\n\nReached for comment, the White House referred PEOPLE to a post on X from the Justice Department, which claimed that some of the newly released Epstein files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.\"\n\n\"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false,\" the post reads. \"And if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has released thousands of files related to the late financier and convicted sex offender since Dec. 19, as required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed by Congress and signed by Trump, though some documents have been heavily redacted.\n\nSome photos show Epstein with individuals who appear to be children.

The images were released without context and have several faces redacted.\n\nTrump was also pictured with Epstein in photos that were taken down from the official website and eventually put back up following backlash.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe information contained in the files is separate from the thousands of documents given to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate.\n\nTrump's name appears multiple times in the emails, including when Epstein questioned the president's mental state and implied he \"knew about the girls\" being trafficked.",

    "fullText": "Graduate and professional students could soon find themselves with more limited student-loan options. Yale has a plan.\n\nThe Yale School of Public Health posted on LinkedIn last week that it will \"soon introduce a replacement loan option\" for student-loan borrowers who are affected by President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Grad PLUS program as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nGrad PLUS allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. Trump's legislation eliminated the program and implemented new borrowing caps: a $100,000 lifetime cap for graduate students and a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional students.\n\nYale said that its new program would \"offer comparable, if not more competitive, loan terms compared to previous Grad PLUS loans,\" adding that more details will be available soon. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to Yale, Bloomberg reported that other schools, such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, are also working to establish financing options for students pursuing advanced degrees, including working with private lenders for additional financing.\n\nEducation policy experts previously told Business Insider that limiting borrowing for advanced degrees could push students to either forgo their programs or turn to the private loan market, which could have riskier terms with higher interest rates.\n\nTrump's Department of Education is set to roll out the student-loan borrowing changes in July 2026. It will affect new students. Existing borrowers will be able to retain their financing options. The department is also introducing its new Repayment Assistance Plan in July, which is intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nSome advocates and Democratic lawmakers have previously expressed concern with the elimination of Grad PLUS and the new caps on borrowing for advanced degrees. The Department of Education proposed a new definition of \"professional,\" compiling a list of 10 programs, like medicine and dentistry, that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap.\n\nEarlier this month, over 140 bipartisan lawmakers signed onto a letter urging the department to revise the limits to include advanced nursing programs in the professional degree designation.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, told Business Insider that \"we expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",

    "fullText": "KISS legend Gene Simmons said his relationship with President Donald Trump is “terrific” as he slammed Americans for caring too much about one another’s political beliefs.\n\n“I don’t really care what people say,” Simmons said in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that aired Sunday. “Life has always been like that.”\n\n“Not everybody loves Jesus, but you can certainly say the following: he was a duly elected president of these United States, perhaps overwhelming by the popular vote, as well as the Electoral College. End of story,” he continued.\n\nSimmons went on to say that it’s “nobody’s damn business who you support.”\n\n“Nowadays, people engage in, so, are you pro or — and my first question is ‘Who the f--- are you? Who are you?’\" Simmons said. “Since when does who I support or not support is the business of anyone except my conscience?”\n\nWhen asked to evaluate the MAGA movement within the Republican Party, Simmons said “some of it makes sense and some not.”\n\n“But literally, have a sense of humor,” he added. “Take a pill, shut up and stop worrying what your next-door neighbor believes or doesn’t believe. It’s their America, too.”\n\nSimmons, who was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors with KISS earlier this month, joined CNN on Capitol Hill, where he is pushing for the passage of the American Music Fairness Act. The bill, which was introduced in the House in January, would require radio corporations to pay artists royalties for playing their music over AM/FM airwaves.\n\nSimmons and music executives recently testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the legislation. In February, hundreds in the music industry — including Stevie Nicks, Celine Dion and Aerosmith — called on Congress in a letter to pass the bipartisan measure to fix what they characterized as an “inequity” that harms U.S. artists at home and abroad.\n\n“If you are against this bill, you are un-American,” Simmons said during his testimony.\n\nDuring the interview with CNN, Simmons responded directly to critics of the bill.\n\n“Radio stations last year made something like $14 billion,” he said in comments recorded on Dec. 9. “Artists, who you heard on the radio stations made zero. Your favorite artist, whether it’s a classic artist or a new artist, made zero. And that is inexcusable.”",

    "description": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.",
    "fullText": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.\n\nMonday’s panel discussed the aftermath of last week’s Turning Point USA event, where Ben Shapiro criticized Tucker Carlson for conducting interviews with white nationalist Nick Fuentes and for refusing to condemn Candace Owens for peddling conspiracy theories about TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Owens, who previously worked for Shapiro at The Daily Wire, has claimed that the Israeli government was involved in the murder.\n\nCarlson spoke moments later and offered a rebuttal. The next night, Steve Bannon spoke at the conference and likewise ripped Shapiro, as did Megyn Kelly. Vice President JD Vance also spoke at the event, where he told the crowd, “You don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”\n\nOn CNN NewsNight, Republican strategist Tim Parrish said there is no room for anti-Semitism and other forms og bigotry in the GOP and that Vance has adequately condemned such attacks, including his remarks about leaked Young Republican group chats that contained all manner of racial slurs and comments about Jews and “gas chambers.”\n\nVance told the group chat members to “grow up,” but he also criticized the “pearl clutching” by those who harshly condemned the messages and said that “kids do stupid things.”\n\n“You guys are mischaracterizing the statements that the vice president made,” Parrish said. “He absolutely came out and condemned and said that there is no place for any comments like that in the Republican Party.”\n\nAdam Mockler of MeidasTouch rejected the claim.\n\n“JD Vance said he’s gonna warn his kids so some ‘scumbag’ doesn’t leak a group chat in a similar way,” Mockler replied. “He was implying the person who leaked the group chat was a scumbag. JD Vance has had the farthest thing from moral clarity this entire time.”\n\nMockler then pivoted to Paul Ingrassia, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to be the acting general counsel of the U.S. General Services Administration. Leaked text messages from Ingrassia show that he said he has a “Nazi streak” and made racist remarks.\n\nHere is Mockler’s exchange with Parrish and Jennings:\n\nMOCKLER: And listen, do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know what– ok, so do you know what Paul Ingrassia said?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: That he has a Nazi streak. Oh, you’ve debated it. But has Trump fired him, or is he still a part of the administration?\n\nJENNINGS: I don’t know where he is right now.\n\nMOCKLER: He’s a part of the administration.

According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced that he’s nominating a MAGA ally to serve as U.S. special envoy to Greenland in a move that drew immediate anger from Denmark.\n\nThe 79-year-old president has long harbored ambitions to take over the Danish semi-autonomous territory. On Sunday, Trump announced that he would appoint Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as the envoy to the island, apparently the first time the U.S. government would have such a role.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nLandry, who only took office as governor in January 2024, and whose term ends in January 2028, described it as a “volunteer position.”\n\n“It’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote on X. He added, “This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nIn reaction, the Danish foreign minister said on Monday that the United States must respect “the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”\n\nLars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement emailed by his ministry to ABC News that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.”\n\n“However, we insist that everyone—including the U.S.—must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added.\n\nHe struck a decidedly more irritated tone in separate comments made to the Danish TV channel TV2. Calling Trump and Landry’s comments “completely unacceptable,” he said he’d be demanding an “explanation” from the U.S. ambassador.\n\n“As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,” he said.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said Landry’s appointment “doesn’t change anything for us here at home.”\n\n“We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country,” he wrote on social media, adding: “Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.”\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is leveraging its economic clout to “assert its will” and is willing to threaten military force against both allies and adversaries.\n\nThe report highlighted the growing “strategic importance of the Arctic” amid the intensifying conflict “between Russia and the West.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly why Trump wants it. During his presidential transition and the opening months of his second term, Trump repeatedly pushed for the United States to assume jurisdiction over Greenland, and he has declined to rule out using military force to seize control of the strategically important, mineral-rich island.\n\n“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social exactly a year ago.\n\nIn March, Vice President JD Vance traveled to a remote U.S. military installation in Greenland, where he accused Denmark of failing to invest adequately in the territory.\n\nWhile the dispute later faded from public view, it resurfaced in August when Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador after reports that at least three individuals with ties to Trump had conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nTrump made Ken Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, the U.S. ambassador to Denmark last year.",

    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "fullText": "For the hefty price of $1 million — plus at least $15,000 in fees — you could potentially get permanent residency in the United States.\n\nThat's the promise of President Donald Trump's \"Gold Card\" visa program, which formally launched in early December.\n\nThe program is designed to attract wealthy foreigners to the US. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at an event on Friday that the program had already raised $1.3 billion since launching.\n\nYet it also comes at a time when the Trump administration is otherwise cracking down on other legal forms of immigration.\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing the Gold Card program in September. Here's what to know about the program.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration's official website for the Gold Card, individuals can receive US residency in \"record time\" if they:\n\nProspective Gold Card holders can also include their spouses and children on their application, but for a price — specifically, an additional $1 million plus $15,000 in DHS fees per person.\n\nThere's also a \"Corporate Gold Card\" program, which allows a corporation to give one of its employees US residency for a $2 million gift.\n\nThat program also allows the Gold Card to be transferred to another employee, for a fee.\n\nAccording to the website, approved cardholders receive EB-1 or EB-2 visas.\n\nThe EB-1 visa — known colloquially as the \"Einstein visa\" — was originally intended for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, outstanding professors and researchers, and multinational managers and executives.\n\nThe EB-2 visa is for foreign nationals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities.\n\nEven as Trump rolls out the red carpet for foreigners who can pay $1 million, his administration has sought to crack down on other visas.\n\nThe most notable example is the H-1B visa, which is for high-skilled foreign workers, many of whom work in the tech sector.\n\nThe administration moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas in September, which initially caused chaos at major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee would apply to current employees who leave the country.\n\nEven more chaos came as the administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders, prompting some companies to warn their employees against travel.\n\nLast week, the administration also said it would pause the DV1 diversity visa lottery program.\n\nThe US wouldn't be the first country to establish a residence-by-investment program.\n\nIn fact, there are several countries that offer foreigners residency in exchange for payment or investment.\n\nThey include countries like Thailand, Panama, Latvia, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.\n\nThe Gold Card website also teases a \"Platinum Card,\" which they say is \"Coming Soon.\" The September executive order does not mention a Platinum Card.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, foreign nationals will be able to pay $5 million and the $15,000 DHS fees in exchange for a visa allowing them to stay in the US for 270 days without being subject to US taxes on non-US income.\n\nThat $5 million sum mirrors the $5 million originally floated by Trump officials for the Gold Card, which has since been lowered to $1 million.\n\nThe website includes a waitlist, along with a note that there's \"no assurance that the Platinum Card contribution will remain at $5 million.\"",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

    "fullText": "A top Republican appears to be seriously eyeing a run for the White House in 2028, which would put him on a collision course with Vice President JD Vance, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMorton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said that he believes that his longtime friend, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is seriously eyeing a run for the presidency.\n\nDuring a meeting in Washington, D.C., in November, Cruz, who has given a number of speeches decrying antisemitism in the GOP, told Klein he had been fielding requests from people urging him to seek the White House in 2028.\n\nCruz, Klein said, came across as someone “seriously” considering such a run.\n\nTwo additional sources confirmed that Cruz is weighing what would be his second presidential bid.\n\nCruz failed to gain the GOP nod in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Republican Party nomination and the White House.\n\nThe Washington Post said that Cruz in recent months has positioned himself as a voice for a more traditional, interventionist GOP foreign policy.\n\nThe senator has also called on the GOP to separate itself from former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, whom Cruz has said is injecting the “poison” of antisemitism into the Republican Party.\n\nCruz has also criticized Vance, a close ally of Carlson, to Republican donors, two people familiar with the senator’s comments told the Pose.\n\nCruz has also said that Vance’s foreign policy views are dangerously isolationist.\n\nVance is widely expected to seek the GOP nomination for president in 2028. President Trump has said that a ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be potent.\n\nVance widely leads polling on the race for the GOP nod for the White House. The veep is also the favorite of gamblers placing bets on the 2028 race on legal wagering sites.\n\n“Can Ted help craft or meld together the traditional Republican approach with the new reality of what the Republican Party is now?” said Daron Shaw, a political science professor at the University of Texas who overlapped with Cruz as a staffer on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign. “It’s a heavy lift.”",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump is gathering with top national security officials on Monday, a meeting that comes as the U.S. Coast Guard steps up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Republican administration's escalating pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Navy Secretary John Phelan are scheduled to join Trump, who is vacationing at his Mar-a-Lago resort, for what the White House called a \"major announcement.\" Trump plans to discuss a shipbuilding initiative at the event, according to a White House official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut Trump's gathering of key members of his national security team also comes at yet another inflection point in Trump's four-month pressure campaign on the Maduro government, which began with the stated purpose of stemming the flow of illegal drugs from the South American nation but has developed into something more amorphous.\n\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry has started evacuating the families of diplomats from Venezuela, according to a European intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the evacuations include women and children and began on Friday. The official said Russian Foreign Ministry officials are assessing the situation in Venezuela in “very grim tones.” The White House and Kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard on Monday continued for the second day to chase a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration describes as part of a “dark fleet” Venezuela is using to evade U.S. sanctions. The tanker, the official added, is flying under a false flag and is under a U.S. judicial seizure order.\n\nIt is the third ship pursued by the Coast Guard, which on Saturday seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries that U.S. officials said was part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet.\n\nThe Coast Guard, with assistance from the Navy, seized a sanctioned tanker called Skipper on Dec. 10, also part of the shadow fleet of tankers that the U.S. says operates on the fringes of the law to move sanctioned cargo. That ship was registered in Panama.\n\nTrump, after that first seizure, said the U.S. would carry out a “blockade” of Venezuela. Trump has repeatedly said that Maduro's days in power are numbered.\n\nLast week, Trump demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from U.S. oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against sanctioned oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said in a Monday appearance on “Fox & Friends” that the targeting of tankers is intended to send “a message around the world that the illegal activity that Maduro is participating in cannot stand, he needs to be gone, and that we will stand up for our people.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Defense Department, under Trump's orders, continues its campaign of attacks on smaller vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleges are carrying drugs to the United States and beyond.\n\nAt least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.",

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that Section VII's prohibition on discrimination based on sex applied to gender identity.\n\n“We agree that homosexuality and transgender status are distinct concepts from sex,” the court’s majority opinion stated. “But, as we’ve seen, discrimination based on homosexuality or transgender status necessarily entails discrimination based on sex; the first cannot happen without the second.”\n\nO'Neill's lawsuit argued, “The Executive Order rejects the existence of gender identity altogether, let alone the possibility that someone’s gender identity can differ from their sex, which it characterizes as ‘gender ideology.’”\n\nIn addition to restoring her workplace rights and protections, O'Neill is seeking financial damages.\n\nTrump's order was among a flurry of executive actions he took hours after taking office. He has continued using executive action aggressively in his second presidency, prompting many legal challenges that are still working their way through the federal judiciary.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nTrump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While ​federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status.\n\nICE and Border Patrol ‌will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 - a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July.\n\nAdministration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up ‌more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.\n\nThe expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nMiami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics.\n\n\"People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,\" said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican ⁠political strategist. \"There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.\"\n\nTrump’s ‌overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50% in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major U.S. cities, to 41% in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue.\n\nRising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining U.S. citizens.\n\nIn addition to expanding enforcement ‍actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office in January.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ​the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.\n\n“I think you're going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.\n\nHoman ‌said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.\n\nSarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said U.S. businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump's immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.\n\nPierce said it will be interesting to see \"whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.\"\n\nTrump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to U.S. cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.\n\nSome businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors walk them. Some U.S. citizens started carrying passports.\n\nDespite ⁠the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have ​not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.\n\nSome 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE ​and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6% of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of ‍U.S. citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from ⁠certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.\n\nThe administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the U.S. economy and Republican-leaning business owners.\n\nReplacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue ⁠in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress.\n\nAdministration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nSome immigration hardliners have called for more workplace enforcement.\n\n\"Eventually you’re going to have to go after these ‌employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”",

    "description": "Trump is touting tariff revenues and a shrinking trade deficit as his economic accomplishments ahead or midterms, but economists say it's complicated.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is working to sell his economic policies.\n\nTo convince the nation that the economy is improving ahead of the midterm elections, Trump is highlighting a reduced trade deficit and high tariff revenues as his key economic accomplishments since taking office.\n\nThe reality is more complicated.\n\nEconomists have told Business Insider that a smaller trade deficit and a record-breaking amount of tariff revenue can be poor indicators of overall economic health at best, and signs of economic trouble at worst.\n\n\"This idea that if we lower the trade deficit, we're going to buy from US companies and we're all better off — it's seductive for people to think that way,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank, told Business Insider. \"But it's just an incomplete view.\"\n\n'\"Unlike the budget deficit, the trade deficit is meaningless,\" Winegarden added. \"It has nothing to do with affordability, and it has nothing to do with growth, so it's a complete red herring.\"\n\nTrump is touring swing states, and he appeared on prime-time TV for a national economic address.\n\n\"Remember when I said 'tariff' — my favorite word is 'tariff,'\" Trump told a crowd in Pennsylvania, \"Tariffs are bringing us hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\n\"We had the worst trade deals ever made, and our country was laughed at from all over the world, but they're not laughing anymore,\" Trump added in the national speech last week.\n\nThe White House, in a December press release, also touted that \"the trade deficit has narrowed to its smallest since mid-2020\" in September, citing it as \"more proof that President Donald J. Trump's America First trade agenda is working.\"\n\nKimberly Clausing, professor of tax law and policy at the UCLA School of Law and a previous official at the US Department of the Treasury, told Business Insider that despite the negative association with the word \"deficit,\" a smaller trade deficit could simply mean that people are pulling back on spending and investing overall.\n\n\"In the United States in recent years, a declining trade deficit is often associated with a weak economy, due to reduced consumption and investment,\" said Clausing. \"That may be the case now as well, since some market indicators show economic weakness.\"\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the total volume of both exports and imports, adjusted for inflation, was in decline for three months preceding August.\n\nDespite a steady stock market, the US economy is showing signs of weakness.\n\nWhile inflation slowed in November, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the data may have been impacted by the government shutdown.\n\n\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" according to a report published in October by the Federal Reserve of St. Louis that looked at data from January to August of this year. \"The rise in prices beginning in early 2025 coincides closely with tariff developments.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the country lost 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, while the unemployment rate rose to a four-year high of 4.6% in the past month.\n\nIn domestic manufacturing, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 12,706,000 employees in the sector as of September 2025, down 49,000 from a base of 12,755,000 employees at the end of January 2025, when Trump took office.\n\nWinegarden said that tariffs create an opportunity cost, because when more money is spent either by paying taxes on a foreign good or on a domestic product that is more expensive, that reduces the nation's power to buy, invest, and hire.\n\n\"When you're buying the least cost-efficient option, you're subsidizing jobs that are less efficient, and sentiments aside, that's bad for long-term job creation,\" said Winegarden.\n\nJason Furman, professor of the practice of economic policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, also told Business Insider that the perception that tariffs have decreased trade deficits may be false to begin with, and they did not create any fiscal benefits for the nation.\n\n\"The trade deficit — it has not actually narrowed. There has just been a timing shift,\" said Furman. \"What happened was a lot of imports were pulled forward and ended up being unusually large in Dec 2024 through March 2025,\"\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau's International Trade in Goods and Services report, the national trade deficit was $95.2 billion larger in the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.\n\n\"Tariffs are bringing in substantial revenue, but that revenue is largely offsetting other tax cuts done by the Trump administration,\" said Furman.\n\n\"Moreover,\" Furman added, \"A meaningful portion of the tariff revenue is coming from American consumers in the form of higher prices.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is losing what author Michael Wolff calls “reflex control,” and no one in his inner circle is willing to offer an honest assessment of his capabilities. This, Wolff claims, is leading the president to become increasingly uninhibited in his public pronouncements.\n\nDiscussing the president’s remarks this week on everything from the tragic murders of Rob Reiner and his wife Michele to the mess the FBI made of first lady Melania Trump’s underwear drawer, Wolff told his Inside Trump’s Head podcast co-host Joanna Coles that Trump is exhibiting a problem of “reflex control.”\n\nWolff also discussed comments made by Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles in a now-viral Vanity Fair story where she described the president as having an “alcoholic’s personality.”\n\n“Susie Wiles might have just as well said, ‘It’s like dealing with a dementia patient.’ I mean, it is the same thing,” Wolff explained. “And because he doesn’t drink, it is probably closer to that, in which he has the uninhibited aspects of his personality—that might be anger, or self-pity, or in his case racism—become increasingly more uninhibited, and that seems to be what’s going on. He opens his mouth and you go, ‘This is a problem.’”\n\nColes highlighted another example, from September, where Trump took the stage at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service and ranted about how much he hated his enemies. “It’s just peculiar at this stage,” Coles added. “And no one around him seems to be saying, ‘Enough already, you sound deranged.’”\n\n“It’s true, no one around them does say that,” Wolff replied, before going on to discuss the fact that the U.S. has had two octogenarian presidents back-to-back, and few people around former President Joe Biden seemed willing to break ranks and disclose his health concerns to the public.\n\n“Joe Biden had enormous cognitive difficulties, and everyone around him closed ranks to protect him until he could no longer be protected,” Wolff said, adding that there is “no way to diagnose the president.”\n\n“There is no way for us to say, ‘OK, he is experiencing cognitive issues of an alarming variety.’ And no one around him is going to say that. Although Susie Wiles, in acknowledging the alcoholic thing, was curious.”\n\nMedical experts have studied the president’s public speeches and mannerisms, as well as his documented health issues, including chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and the ever-present bandages on his hand, and concluded that he is in decline and perhaps even exhibiting signs of someone with dementia.\n\nMary Trump, the president’s niece, has echoed these concerns, noting that her grandfather—Trump’s father, Fred Sr.—lived with Alzheimer’s for many years.\n\nThe White House has continued to insist that Trump is in excellent health, even going so far as to claim that the MRI he underwent during his most recent physical exam was standard for patients his age. Medical professionals were quick to dispute this.\n\nThe president has also repeatedly bragged about “acing” three separate cognitive assessments, and has described the elementary school-level tests as being “very hard.”\n\n“He bragged about this,” said Wolff of Trump’s claim of acing the medical assessments, “which is yet another symptom, obviously, a heightened sensitivity to this issue and a defensiveness about it.”\n\n“We have a whole set of symptoms here,” Wolff said of the president. “This idea of a president’s mental health, we don’t really have a context for this, when, in fact, the context should be: this is a paramount issue.”\n\n“Obviously, if the president is unwell, we should discuss that. It actually is an issue, probably, of far greater importance than any other political issue.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung replied: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "fullText": "The leaders of Denmark and Greenland insisted Monday that the U.S. won't take over Greenland and demanded respect for their territorial integrity after President Donald Trump ‍​announced ​the appointment of a ‌special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump's announcement on Sunday that Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry would be the U.S. special envoy prompted a new flare-up of tensions over Washington's interest in the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a NATO ally. Denmark's foreign minister said in comments to Danish broadcasters that he plans to summon the U.S. ambassador.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,\" Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\n“Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and the U.S. shall not take over Greenland,” they added in the statement, emailed by Frederiksen's office. \"We expect respect for our joint territorial integrity.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump announced Landry's appointment as ‌special envoy, saying that “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”\n\nLandry wrote in a post on X that “it’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\nDanish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.”\n\n\"However, we insist that everyone — including the U.S. — must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added.\n\nDanish broadcasters TV2 and DR reported that in comments from the Faroe Islands later Monday, Løkke Rasmussen said he will call in the U.S. ambassador in Copenhagen, Kenneth Howery, for a meeting at the ministry.\n\nBefore issuing the joint statement with Frederiksen, Nielsen wrote on Facebook that Denmark had again woken up to a new announcement from the U.S. president, but it “does not change anything for us at home.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in an annual report that the U.S. is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nDenmark is a member of the European Union as well as NATO.\n\nAnouar El Anouni, a spokesperson for the EU's executive Commission, told reporters in Brussels Monday that it wasn't for him to comment on U.S. decisions. But he underlined the bloc's position that \"preserving the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark, its sovereignty and the inviolability of its borders is essential for the European Union.”",

    "fullText": "BERLIN, Dec 22 (Reuters) - German car exports to the United States slumped by almost 14% in the first three ​quarters of 2025, making it the hardest-hit branch of German ‌industry in U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war, according to a study seen ‌by Reuters on Monday.\n\nUnder an agreement between Washington and Brussels, the U.S. set a 15% baseline tariff on cars from Europe from August 1 - significantly less than Trump's initial rate of 25% on top of ⁠a 2.5% existing levy.\n\nGerman ‌engineering companies have also struggled under the tariff regime, with the study showing exports in that sector ‍to the U.S. declining by 9.5% in the first nine months of 2025.\n\nMachinery exports are subject to a 50% U.S. tariff on steel and aluminium ​products.\n\nThe chemical industry also saw exports to the country's top export ‌market decline by 9.5%, although the report said this could not be blamed solely on tariffs.\n\n\"Other factors are likely to have played a role in the case of chemical products, such as lower production in Germany due to higher energy prices,\" it said.\n\nAcross all ⁠sectors, German exports to the U.S. ​were down 7.8% year on year over ​the three quarters - following average growth of nearly 5% in the comparable periods of 2016 to 2024.\n\n\"Since it ‍must currently be ⁠assumed that U.S. import tariffs will not return to pre-Trump administration levels in the foreseeable future, a significant recovery in German ⁠exports to the U.S. is unlikely,\" study author Samina Sultan said, referring to ‌a \"new normal\" for German exporters.",

    "description": "\"60 Minutes\" abruptly dropped a segment about Trump deportees sent to a megaprison in El Salvador Sunday — two hours before it was set to air.",
    "fullText": "“60 Minutes” abruptly pulled a segment Sunday on the Trump administration deporting hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a megaprison in El Salvador, a stunning move that comes on the heels of President Donald Trump complaining that the CBS newsmagazine has “treated him far worse” under new management.\n\nFor days, CBS had been promoting Sunday’s segment, “Inside CECOT,” which promised to reveal “brutal and torturous conditions” inside El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center. Correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi had spoken to now released deportees, according to a Friday press release. But the segment was pulled Sunday evening, around two hours before it was to set to air.\n\n“The 60 Minutes report on ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast,” CBS told TheWrap in a statement. “We determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nAlfonsi sent an indignant internal memo to colleagues saying that pulling the segment “is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” The memo was immediately leaked.\n\nShe wrote: “If the standard for airing a story is that ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast. We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nHere is Sharyn Alfonsi’s email to her ‘60 Minutes’ colleagues in full: pic.twitter.com/ilGoSROQEs\n\n— Michael M. Grynbaum (@grynbaum) December 22, 2025\n\nAlfonsi said the segment had been screened and fact-checked by CBS lawyers and Standards and Practices. Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who watched it Friday, decided to hold it.\n\nWeiss responded on Sunday: “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nBut the decision to pull such a heavily promoted and presumably hard-hitting segment on the Trump administration is sure to come under intense scrutiny given the president’s recent comments about “60 Minutes” and his relationship with David Ellison, who now runs CBS News-parent Paramount.\n\nSocial media exploded on Sunday night with criticism of Weiss, declaring that she had failed her own standard that she announced in ascending to the role of running CBS News, “to seek the truth and tell it plainly.”\n\n“If this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn’t a news division anymore. It’s TASS,” said veteran reporter Bill Carter, referring to the Soviet-era news agency.\n\nIf this decision is not reversed, if CBS News will only run a piece if WH comments, giving them veto power over journalism, any staff member w integrity will likely quit, bc it isn't a news division anymore. It's TASS. https://t.co/RjjZNX7nHm\n\n— Bill Carter (@wjcarter) December 22, 2025\n\nBut “60 Minutes” has lately run afoul of Trump yet again. Earlier this month, after “60 Minutes” aired an interview with his former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump referenced the settlement in taking aim at ownership.\n\nLast week, Trump unloaded again, “For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before. If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies.”\n\nTrump sued CBS last year over how “60 Minutes” edited an interview with his then-2024 rival, Kamala Harris. The network initially dismissed Trump’s suit as “without merit” and vowed to “vigorously defend” itself. But CBS-parent Paramount settled with Trump for $16 million in July as the company was seeking FCC approval to merge with Ellison’s Skydance.\n\nSince the merger, Ellison appointed Weiss, the co-founder of the Free Press, to serve as editor-in-chief. Trump has praised Weiss in the past, as well as Ellison, who is now vying to takeover Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of CNN. Ellison’s father, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is a Trump supporter.\n\nTrump returned to “60 Minutes” last month for his first interview since the settlement. “I see good things happening in the news. I really do. And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”\n\nWatch a teaser for the “60 Minutes” segment below:\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y\n\n— Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) December 21, 2025\n\nThe post ‘60 Minutes’ Abruptly Pulls Segment on Trump Deportees Sent to El Salvador Megaprison appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "fullText": "A White House envoy said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives to end the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPosting on social media, Steve Witkoff said the talks aimed at aligning on a shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe.\n\n“Our shared priority is to stop the killing, ensure guaranteed security, and create conditions for Ukraine’s recovery, stability, and long-term prosperity. Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future,\" U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy said.\n\nThe talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.\n\nWitkoff's assessment comes as negotiations have been proceeding with Russia as well. A Kremlin envoy said Saturday that the talks were pressing on “constructively” in Florida.\n\n“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters in Miami on Saturday. There were no immediate updates on the talks with Russia on Sunday.\n\nDmitriev met with Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.\n\nFor Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram Sunday that diplomatic efforts were “moving forward quite quickly, and our team in Florida has been working with the American side.”\n\nThe Kremlin denied Sunday that trilateral talks involving Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were under discussion, after Zelenskyy said Saturday that Washington had proposed the idea of three-way discussions.\n\n“At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge it is not being prepared,” Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agencies.\n\nUkrainian civilians moved to Russia\n\nIn Ukraine, the country’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets on Sunday accused Russian forces of forcibly removing about 50 Ukrainian civilians from the Ukrainian Sumy border region to Russian territory.\n\nWriting on Telegram, he said that Russian forces illegally detained the residents in the village of Hrabovske on Thursday, before moving them to Russia on Saturday.\n\nLubinets said he contacted Russia’s human rights commissioner, requesting information on the civilians’ whereabouts and conditions, and demanding their immediate return to Ukraine.\n\nThe French presidency on Sunday welcomed Putin’s willingness to speak with President Emmanuel Macron, saying it would decide how to proceed “in the coming days.”\n\n“As soon as the prospect of a ceasefire and peace negotiations becomes clearer, it becomes useful again to speak with Putin,” Macron’s office said in a statement. “It is welcome that the Kremlin publicly agrees to this approach.”\n\nThe statement came after reports that Putin was open to holding talks with the French president if there was mutual political will.\n\nEuropean Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has fueled new speculation about his health after an awkward descent on Air Force One’s stairs.\n\nA video of the 79-year-old president exiting the plane at Palm Beach International Airport on Saturday morning, posted by MAGA influencer Paul Villarreal, has drawn attention online for Trump’s odd hand movement and slow, careful descent.\n\nIn the video, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs. He cautiously navigates the steps while gripping tightly onto the railing, taking about 18 seconds to reach the bottom of the short staircase.\n\nPresident Trump exited Air Force One tonight in West Palm Beach. He is headed to Mar-a-Lago.\n. pic.twitter.com/Z4vBY8qobw\n\n— Paul Villarreal (AKA Vince Manfeld) (@AureliusStoic1) December 20, 2025\n\nHe then plops into “The Beast,” the heavily armored presidential car, where he is seen drinking what appears to be a Diet Coke. Trump is spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nCritics online were quick to note the president’s apparent frailty and peculiar leg-slapping.\n\n“Tapping that leg to make sure it works going down,” one X user commented.\n\nAnother wrote, “I wish he concentrated on the economy like he concentrated on going down those stairs.”\n\nOne person hypothesized about his hand motions, “It is not his leg he is touching, but he is trying to get life back into his hand.”\n\nThe elderly president’s supporters defended him, however, with many pointing out that Trump had just wrapped up a long day, including a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.\n\nTrump—who was filmed stumbling on Air Force One’s stairs during a visit to New Jersey in June this year—has frequently spoken about being “very careful” about walking down stairs to avoid the perils of his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n“I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs like these stairs—I walk very slowly,“ Trump said while addressing the nation’s top generals in September.\n\nA few days later, he brought up the subject again while taking shots at Biden during a speech to Navy sailors.\n\n“We had a horrible, horrible president who had no clue what the hell was happening. The chances of him walking down those stairs successfully were not good,” he said. “And I have to be careful because one day I’m gonna probably fall.”\n\nThe commander-in-chief then revealed what he apparently tells himself while walking down stairs: “I always say, ‘Walk down the steps nice and slowly.’ You ever notice? I don’t have to bop down the stairs. ‘Walk nice and slowly.’”\n\nQuestions around Trump’s health have dogged him in his second term, particularly after he let slip that he had undergone an MRI scan in October.\n\nThe White House eventually said it was a “preventative” look at his heart and abdomen, a claim met with skepticism from medical experts who stressed that there was “nothing standard” about the scan.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump ‍on Sunday ​announced ​he ⁠is appointing Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as the U.S. ‌special envoy to Greenland, the vast, semi-autonomous territory of Denmark that Trump has said the U.S. needs to take over.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in announcing the appointment.\n\nTrump during his presidential transition and in the early months of his return to the White House repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\nThe issue had drifted out of the headlines in recent months, but in August, Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nEarlier this year, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base on the island and accused Denmark of underinvesting there.\n\nTrump has said that Greenland is crucial for U.S. security and hasn’t ruled out taking the island by military force, even though Denmark is a NATO ally of the U.S.\n\nLandry took office as governor in January 2024. His term ends in January 2028.\n\n“It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote in a posting on X in which he thanked Trump for the appointment. He added, \"This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nDenmark, a NATO ally of the U.S., and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. gathering intelligence there. The U.S. push for Greenland is also opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\nThe Embassy of Denmark in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Landry's appointment.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is using its economic power to “assert its will” and threaten military force against friend and foe alike.\n\nThe service, in its annual assessment, said Washington’s greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\n\"The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” the report said.",

    "fullText": "Fox News host Jesse Watters claimed that President Donald Trump told him he is building the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself\n\nHe added that Trump said he was doing so because “no one else will”\n\nWatters recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix on Dec. 20\n\nJesse Watters claims President Donald Trump told him he is constructing the new White House ballroom as a “monument” to himself — and that he’s doing it “because no one else will.”\n\nThe Fox News host recounted the alleged conversation while speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, a multiday conservative conference and festival in Phoenix, on Saturday, Dec. 20. A video of the moment has since been posted on X.\n\nWatters, 47, told the large crowd that he was sharing a meal with Trump, 79, when the president asked him if he wanted to see a rendition of “the big, beautiful ballroom.”\n\n“I said, ‘Sure, let me see it,’ “ Watters continued. “He [Trump] rolls the whole thing out. And guys, I don't know if you know this — the ballroom is huge. Like, I said, ‘Mr. President, the ballroom is four times the size of the White House.' ”\n\n“He said, ‘Jesse, it's a monument. I'm building a monument to myself — because no one else will,' \" Watters added, eliciting loud laughs from the audience.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nTrump recently said that the 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which is being built on the site of the former East Wing, will now cost $400 million — a significant jump from earlier estimates.\n\nTrump announced the updated price tag on Dec. 17 during a Hanukkah reception at the White House, where he also revealed that a federal judge has allowed construction on the controversial project to move forward. He repeated the figure multiple times while thanking the official for clearing the way for continued construction, describing the ruling as an act of “courage.”\n\nThe ballroom — which is being funded entirely by private donors, including a contribution from Trump himself — is expected to be completed by summer 2028.\n\nTrump has argued that the sprawling ballroom is needed so future presidents can host large events indoors rather than on the South Lawn.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIt's unclear just how many people the space can accommodate. Trump told NBC News in September that it would hold up to 900 people; BBC reporting cites plans for a capacity of 1,350.\n\nOn Dec. 16, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected a request from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt construction while the project undergoes additional review, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHowever, the judge said he plans to hold a hearing in January on the group’s request for a preliminary injunction and warned the administration not to make underground construction decisions that would lock in the design of the ballroom above ground, per Bloomberg.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 career diplomats from ambassadorial and other senior embassy posts as it moves to reshape the U.S. diplomatic posture abroad with personnel deemed fully supportive of President Donald Trump’s “America First” priorities.\n\nThe chiefs of mission in at least 29 countries were informed last week that their tenures would end in January, according to two State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel moves.\n\nAll of them had taken up their posts in the Biden administration but had survived an initial purge in the early months of Trump’s second term that targeted mainly political appointees. That changed on Wednesday when they began to receive notices from officials in Washington about their imminent departures.\n\nAmbassadors serve at the pleasure of the president although they typically remain at their posts for three to four years. Those affected by the shake-up are not losing their foreign service jobs but will be returning to Washington for other assignments should they wish to take them, the officials said.\n\nThe State Department declined to comment on specific numbers or ambassadors affected, but defended the changes, calling them “a standard process in any administration.” It noted that an ambassador is “a personal representative of the president and it is the president’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda.”\n\nAfrica is the continent most affected by the removals, with ambassadors from 13 countries being removed: Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSecond is Asia, with ambassadorial changes coming to six countries: Fiji, Laos, the Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam affected.\n\nFour countries in Europe (Armenia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Slovakia) are affected; as are two each in the Middle East (Algeria and Egypt); South and Central Asia (Nepal and Sri Lanka); and the Western Hemisphere (Guatemala and Suriname).\n\nPolitico was the first to report on the ambassadorial recalls, which have drawn concern from some lawmakers and the union representing American diplomats.",

    "fullText": "The Kennedy Center is already losing performers after Donald Trump slapped his name on the storied arts institution.\n\nKristy Lee, a folk singer scheduled to perform at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts on Jan. 14, is in talks to cancel her appearance, her spokesperson told NOTUS, as other artists also move to sever ties with the venue.\n\nOne performer, who spoke to NOTUS on the condition of anonymity, said Trump’s renaming had left a permanent “stain” on the center.\n\nAnother lamented what the Kennedy Center once represented—for artists and for the country at large. “I feel really badly for performers, not just for performers but for the people who work there,” they said.\n\n“Kennedy Center is supposed to be a memorial, focusing on being nonpartisan. A place where people, it doesn’t matter what party they believe in, should be performing and experiencing the arts together regardless of what their party is. And it has not become that.”\n\nOther artists who reluctantly chose to keep their scheduled performances at the center told NOTUS they are doing so as an act of resistance to the 79-year-old president.\n\n“Reality show personality and con artist aren’t the type of artist the center showcases,” one artist said. They added that they “don’t associate the arts, or this building, with Trump.”\n\n“And I guess the real debate up till now is what you boycott it and help ensure it goes down the tubes,” the musician added. “Or do you do the concerts and keep the audiences that love going to the Kennedy Center. And make sure there’s something there after this guy leaves. And it could be restored from however he trashes it.”\n\nThe backlash follows an announcement Thursday from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt that the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts would be tackily renamed to include Trump’s name after a vote by the venue’s board, which is now stacked with MAGA loyalists.\n\n“Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future!” she wrote on X. “The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur.”\n\nThe board includes White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles; Attorney General Pam Bondi; second lady Usha Vance; Deputy White House Chief of Staff Dan Scavino; and Allison Lutnick, the wife of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nA source told CNN that Trump phoned into Thursday’s meeting ahead of the vote.\n\nA day later, the president’s name was quickly and tackily plastered onto the center’s building, which now reads: “The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”\n\nDemocrats and historians, however, have insisted that renaming the venue requires an act of Congress.\n\n“The Kennedy Center was named by law. To change the name would require a revision of that 1964 law,” Ray Smock, a former House historian, wrote in an email to the Associated Press. “The Kennedy Center board is not a lawmaking entity. Congress makes laws.”\n\nMeanwhile, many of Kennedy’s relatives have expressed their outrage.\n\n“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy, 66, wrote on X Friday.\n\nThe lawyer and former president’s niece added: “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”\n\nTrump set his sights on the center months ago and has repeatedly suggested it be renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in public remarks and on social media. At the same time, ticket sales have reportedly plummeted and audiences thinned since Trump’s takeover.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "title": "Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump",
    "description": "The DOJ removed already-public Epstein files in defiance of a disclosure statute, prompting bipartisan outrage and impeachment talk from the law’s authors.",
    "fullText": "(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\n\nThe Justice Department is now engaged in an open cover-up carried out in direct violation of federal law.\n\nOver the weekend, the department quietly removed 16 photographs from the Epstein files website it created to comply with a disclosure statute passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump. The removals came without notice or explanation. Among the deleted images was one of the few photographs that even indirectly featured Trump, a picture of a credenza drawer inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Manhattan home containing other photographs, including at least one of Trump. Twelve others depicted Epstein’s third-floor massage room, a central crime scene in the federal investigation. Some images of the same room remain public. Others disappeared.\n\nWhen Democrats on the House Oversight Committee asked whether the Trump-related image had been taken down, the Justice Department declined to respond.\n\nWhat followed made matters worse.\n\nIn a post on X quoting Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Justice Department claimed that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.” Blanche’s original post asserted that the department had released Epstein materials “under the Epstein Files Transparency Act” and that additional disclosures would follow “as our review continues, consistent with the law and with protections for victims.”\n\nThat explanation fails under the statute the department invoked.\n\nCongress did not authorize a rolling review. The Epstein Files Transparency Act compels the Justice Department to release all Epstein-related materials in its possession. The law imposes a mandatory disclosure obligation and permits only limited redactions to protect victims. It grants no authority to retract, revise, or curate records after release. Once the department published those materials, the law required that they remain available to the public.\n\nRemoving them placed the department in direct conflict with the statute Congress enacted.\n\nThat conflict was immediately recognized. Blanche’s post received a community note stating that the law requires the release of all files and allows only narrow redactions to protect victims, adding that the department’s partial release and extensive redactions violated the statute. The Justice Department’s own post received a community note citing the statute directly and stating that retractions and redactions to protect politically exposed persons are not permitted. Community Notes appear only when users with differing political viewpoints agree on their accuracy, underscoring how broadly that conclusion was shared.\n\nThe department’s own explanation confirms it is violating the law it claims to follow.\n\nThe sequence exposes motive. The files went live. Political reaction followed. The department then altered the public record. Compliance held only until presidential exposure appeared, then gave way to erasure.\n\nIn November, I described the Trump Justice Department’s handling of the Epstein files as a cover-up. Last week, I wrote that the administration’s delay in disclosure created a political problem rather than an immediate legal one. That assessment reflected weak enforcement mechanisms and an approach built on delay rather than open defiance.\n\nRemoving already released material that implicates the president converts a credibility crisis into a statutory violation and a far larger political emergency. Congress passed the Epstein disclosure statute precisely to eliminate executive discretion. Lawmakers acted because the Justice Department repeatedly demonstrated it could not be trusted to manage politically sensitive material involving powerful figures. The law mandated disclosure to prevent executive self-protection.\n\nThe department seized that discretion anyway.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi had lawful options. She could have sought judicial review. She could have consulted Congress. She could have acknowledged that the statute permits no removal authority and sought amendment. Each path would have preserved institutional legitimacy. She chose concealment and false justification instead.\n\nThis erasure differs from earlier Trump-era document fights in a crucial way. Prior disputes centered on whether materials must be disclosed. This episode involves evidence already released to the public under statutory standards. The department determined the images satisfied the law’s requirements, then removed them once the political cost became apparent.\n\nEvery disclosure statute now faces the same test: compliance survives only until it threatens the president. Months of delay, sweeping redactions, and staged releases already convinced much of the public that the Justice Department prioritized Trump’s standing over transparency, victims, and the public interest. The image removals confirm that conclusion decisively.\n\nA Justice Department that edits evidence to shield the president forfeits legitimacy. Oversight collapses when obedience ends at political inconvenience. The rule of law depends on statutes binding the executive even when compliance proves costly.\n\nCongress wrote a law to prevent exactly this abuse. The president signed it. The attorney general is now violating it to protect him. That meets any reasonable standard for impeachment.\n\nThe backlash on Capitol Hill was immediate and bipartisan. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who forced the House vote compelling disclosure, both said the Justice Department failed to comply with the law. Khanna has confirmed that he and Massie are drafting impeachment and contempt measures against Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nCongress now faces a choice. It can accept that disclosure laws apply only when politically painless. It can normalize the disappearance of already public evidence. It can allow executive power to override legislative command.\n\nOr it can enforce the law it wrote.\n\nThis is a cover-up enforced through executive defiance. The question now is whether Congress will enforce its own laws.\n\nThe post Impeachable: Pam Bondi Defied Federal Law by Erasing Epstein Photos to Protect Trump first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — When Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest convention reached its halfway point, Erika Kirk tried to put a smiling face on things.\n\n“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk, who has led the influential conservative organization since her husband Charlie was assassinated in September. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”\n\nSome of the biggest names in conservative media took turns torching each other on the main stage, spending more time targeting right-wing rivals than their left-wing opponents.\n\nThe feuds could ultimately define the boundaries of the Republican Party and determine the future of President Donald Trump's fractious coalition, which appears primed for more schisms in the months and years ahead.\n\nHere are some of the most notable moments from the four-day conference.\n\nBen Shapiro, co-founder of the conservative media outlet Daily Wire, set the tone with the first speech after Erika Kirk opened the convention. He attacked fellow commentators in deeply personal terms, saying some of the right's most popular figures are morally bankrupt.\n\nCandace Owens “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years,” he said.\n\nMegyn Kelly is “guilty of cowardice\" because she's refused to condemn Owens for spreading unsubstantiated theories about Kirk's death.\n\nAnd Tucker Carlson's decision to host antisemite Nick Fuentes on his podcast was “an act of moral imbecility.”\n\nBarely an hour later, Carlson took the same stage and mocked Shapiro’s attempt to “deplatform and denounce” people who disagree with him.\n\n“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”\n\nOthers had their chance the next night.\n\n“Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,” said Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser.\n\nKelly belittled Shapiro as a marginal figure in the conservative movement and said their friendship is over.\n\n“I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” Kelly said.\n\nOwens, who has spread unsubstantiated conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's death, wasn't welcome at the convention. But she responded on her podcast, calling Shapiro a “miserable imp.\"\n\nA schism over Israel and antisemitism\n\nIsrael came up repeatedly during the conference.\n\nSome on the right have questioned whether the Republican Party's historically steadfast support for Israel conflicts with Trump's “America First” platform. Carlson criticized civilian deaths in Gaza in remarks that wouldn't have been out of place in progressive circles.\n\nSome attendees dug deep into history, highlighting Israel's attack on the USS Liberty off the Sinai Peninsula in 1967. Israel said it mistook the ship for an Egyptian vessel during the Six Day War, while critics have argued that it was a deliberate strike.\n\nBannon accused Shapiro, who is Jewish, and others who staunchly support Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, the newly installed head of CBS News, “is about Israel.\"\n\nVance gets a helpful endorsement\n\nErika Kirk pledged Turning Point’s support for Vice President JD Vance to be the next Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said on the first night of the convention. Vance would be the 48th president if he takes office after Trump.\n\nTurning Point is a major force on the right, with a massive volunteer network around the country that can be especially helpful in early primary states.\n\nVance was close with Charlie Kirk, whose backing helped enable his rapid political rise. The vice president is scheduled to close out the convention as the final speaker on Sunday.\n\nThe Make America Healthy Again movement had a big presence at Turning Point, signaling its quick rise in the right-wing ecosystem.\n\nMAHA is spearheaded by Robert F. Kennedy, who leads the Department of Health and Human Services. However, there has been friction with other parts of the Make America Great Again coalition, particularly when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations.\n\nWellness influencer Alex Clark, whose podcast is sponsored by Turning Point, asked the crowd whether the Environmental Protection Agency is “with us or against us?”\n\n“Big chemical, big ag and big food are trying to split MAGA from MAHA so things can go back to business as usual, but we don’t want that, do we?” Clark said.\n\nClark and others have asked for Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who responded by reaching out to MAHA activists. The EPA also said it would release a MAHA agenda for the agency.\n\n“The Trump EPA wants to partner with the MAHA community and make sure everyone has a seat at the table,” EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said in response to Clark's speech.",

    "description": "From tariff rebate checks, to bonuses, to Trump accounts, to DOGE dividends, here's all the free money Trump has floated giving to Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump really wants to send you a check.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has pledged to send Americans money in various ways, including tariff rebate checks and bonuses to select government employees.\n\nSome of that free money is becoming a reality: Congress created \"Trump Accounts\" as part of the \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" which will provide tax-free federal grants of $1,000 to children born in the next few years.\n\nOthers remain elusive, or have fallen by the wayside. Remember the DOGE dividend?\n\nTrump also sent out checks during his first term, but under much different circumstances. As part of two successive COVID-era stimulus bills, the federal government sent Americans $1,200 in the spring of 2020 and $600 in the winter, shortly before the president left office.\n\nTrump's signature appeared on those checks, which was a source of controversy during a presidential election year.\n\nIn February, investor James Fishback floated the idea of sending $5,000 \"DOGE Dividend\" checks to almost 80 million taxpaying American households.\n\nThose checks would be paid for by spending cuts achieved by DOGE, the government efficiency office led by Elon Musk at the time.\n\nThe idea quickly caught Musk's attention, and Trump eventually said that they were under consideration.\n\nBut there were some problems. For one, the $5,000 figure was based on Musk's original estimate of $2 trillion in savings, which never materialized.\n\nRepublicans in Congress also balked at the idea, saying they preferred to see a reduction in the national debt.\n\nThe idea eventually faded, though Trump's political operation has continued to float the idea in fundraising emails.\n\nWhile defending tariffs in a November Truth Social post, Trump said his administration would pay \"everyone\" except \"high income people\" a dividend of at least $2,000.\n\nAlthough Trump's Truth Social posts are not actual government orders, the statement drew attention from citizens and his colleagues in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget published an analysis the following day, stating that there would not be enough tariff revenue to support the idea.\n\n\"With our national debt quickly approaching an all-time high and annual budget deficits approaching $2 trillion per year, it is imperative that policymakers focus on actually reducing deficits and putting debt on a downward path,\" the committee wrote.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent also pushed back on Trump's dividend remark during an ABC News interview, saying there were no plans to spend tariff revenue.\n\nTrump would also need approval from Congress to pass such an order, which seems unlikely given the lack of enthusiasm from Republican members.\n\n\"We're facing a deficit this year around $2 trillion,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, told reporters. \"I think whatever revenue we get, from whatever source, ought to go to try and bring down those deficits.\"\n\nThe longest government shutdown in US history began on October 1, spanning 43 days while Democrats and Republicans in Congress negotiated a new budget.\n\nThe fallout forced the government to furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers, while others — such as air traffic controllers — had to continue working without pay ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday rush.\n\nAir traffic controllers received their first $0 paychecks in late October. Some of them stopped showing up for work, sparking a staffing shortage and an onslaught of flight delays and cancellations.\n\n\"They're confronted with a decision: Do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent, or do I go to work and not get paid? They're making decisions,\" Duffys said. \"I've encouraged them all to come to work. I want them to come to work, but they're making life decisions that they shouldn't have to make.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, criticized the air traffic controllers who had not shown up for work during the shutdown in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,\" Trump wrote.\n\nHe said air traffic controllers who didn't take time off during the shutdown were \"GREAT PATRIOTS\" and he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for each of them.\n\nDuffy shared more details in an X post, writing that 776 air traffic controllers would receive $10,000 bonus checks in early December.\n\n\"Santa's coming to town a little early,\" Duffy wrote.\n\nTrump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" into law on July 4, implementing new tax policies and changes to federal programs, including SNAP.\n\nThe bill also introduced so-called Trump Accounts, which are specialized retirement accounts for US children. They were previously referred to as \"money account for growth and advancement,\" or MAGA accounts.\n\nThe Trump administration said children born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, who open Trump Accounts, would receive a one-time $1,000 tax-free federal grant. US children with a valid Social Security number are eligible. Friends, family, and others are allowed to deposit another $5,000 tax-free into those accounts.\n\nThe White House said several CEOs agreed to invest in Trump Accounts, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell pledged to invest $6.25 billion to support Invest America, the federal program that spearheaded Trump Accounts.\n\nHedge fund manager Ray Dalio has also pledged to deposit $250 into the Trump Accounts of 300,000 Connecticut children. Some large companies, like BlackRock, have offered a $1,000 match for the children of eligible employees.\n\nDuring an economic address to Americans in December, Trump said his administration would provide bonus checks to members of the military before Christmas.\n\nIn a subsequent news release, the newly rebranded Department of War said Trump is giving service members bonus checks to \"thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the US military has been defending the nation.\"\n\nThe checks, dubbed the \"Warrior Dividend,\" are each worth $1,776.\n\n\"Money to pay for the Warrior Dividend came earlier this year as part of the president's One Big Beautiful Bill. Approximately 1.28 million active-duty and 174,000 reserve component military members will receive the dividend as a nontaxable supplement to their regular monthly housing allowance,\" the Department of War said.\n\nThe department said eligible service members can expect to see the payment before December 20.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians ​and analysts.\n\nBack in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much ‌of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.\n\nLike all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second ‌year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living, an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.\n\nTrump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nNow, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the ⁠specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control ‌of the House of Representatives.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.\n\n\"Much work remains,\" Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.\n\nMOST ‍POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s\n\nIn his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce, dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.\n\nHe has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies, canceled or restricted access to some ​vaccines, and attacked universities, law firms and media outlets.\n\nDespite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace ‌deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.\n\nAll modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.\n\nThe conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.\n\n\"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt,\" said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.\n\nIn ⁠the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, ​which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support ​for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.\n\nAnalysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.\n\nTrump hit the road this month ‍to promote his economic agenda and kick off ⁠what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.\n\nBut his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue ⁠of \"affordability\" as a Democratic \"hoax\" - alarmed some Republican strategists.\n\nA Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has \"become ‌a persistent drag.\"\n\n\"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years,\" said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more ‌freely discuss internal discussions.",

    "description": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ.",
    "fullText": "Angel Ureña, the deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, spoke out after his boss was featured prominently in Epstein files released by the Trump DOJ, accusing the current administration of trying to use the former president as a “scapegoat.”\n\n“The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” Ureña, who has worked for Clinton for several decades, said in statement on X. “This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nAs Ureña went on, he called out Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles, noting the latter said on the record that “Donald Trump was wrong about Bill Clinton” and his claim that the prominent Democrat visited Epstein’s infamous private island multiple times. (Wiles later clarified that there was “no evidence” proving Trump’s claims.)\n\n“There are two types of people here,” Clinton’s deputy chief of staff continued. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that.”\n\nPer Ureña, “everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.”\n\nRepresentative for the White House and the DOJ did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThe federal government began releasing files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, a month after President Trump ordered their release following a bipartisan push in Congress. As journalists began to comb through the files, photos of Clinton and Michael Jackson surfaced — though, large chunks of the files had also been redacted.\n\nMany have criticized the DOJ over the release, with many noting the Epstein Files Transparency Act meant the government was meant to hand over all of the documents Friday.\n\nThough, the White House has sung a different tune over the files drop. White House spokesperson Abigail Johnson said in a statement that “the Trump Administration is the most transparent in history.”\n\n“By releasing thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have,” she said.\n\nThe post Bill Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff Hits Back at Trump Administration Over Epstein Files Drop: ‘They’ll Try and Hide Forever’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

He first brings up Trump by mentioning the strikes on the alleged Venezuelan drug boats.\n\n“There’s little evidence to support their actions,” he says in the video. “And pretending its all the fake drugs but really it’s a way to claiming a war against Venezuela so we can steal their oil.”\n\nHe also says the evidence of that is the full pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who helped funnel cocaine into the United States.\n\n“If you’re fighting drugs, I don’t know if you should be forgiving the guy who brought 10 flat beds of cocaine into the country,” Matthews said.\n\nMatthews also brings up Hilary Clinton, Israel’s actions against Gaza and Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration.\n\n“The attacks on immigrants and different populations seems pretty racist,” he said.\n\nHis final remark is on how Trump reacted after the murders of legendary director Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle Reiner.\n\n“What a disgusting human being Donald Trump is.

    "description": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump came to North Carolina on Friday to talk about the economy.\n\nHe ended up explaining how his wife organizes her lingerie drawer.\n\n“I think she steams them,” he offered at one point, hoping to underscore the violation Melania Trump felt when, in his telling, FBI agents rummaged through the pristine undergarments — “sometimes referred to as panties” — during their 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn the realm of Trump tangents, it wasn’t the wildest, or angriest, or most bizarre.\n\nYet as the president hopes to refocus the nation’s attention on his economic record ahead of next year’s critical midterm elections, it was another reminder that his own focus often remains somewhat adrift.\n\nTrump did periodically discuss the economy in his 90-minute speech, which he called a “quick little stop” in Rocky Mount on the way to Mar-a-Lago for the holidays. He trumpeted a report this week that showed inflation unexpectedly cooling. He recounted an announcement he made earlier in the day on lowering some drug prices. He framed an uptick in the unemployment rate as a success since he’d fired so many government workers.\n\nSupporters behind him held signs reading “Lower Prices” and “Bigger Paychecks.” But even the visual cues couldn’t keep the president from veering well off-piste — often to the delight of his crowd.\n\nAs he was explaining the negotiations that went into the drug pricing scheme, attendees listened politely, if quietly, as he assumed a French accent to mimic President Emmanuel Macron during their pharmaceutical negotiations.\n\nThe audience really came alive when he reminisced about his opponent from nearly a decade ago.\n\n“I don’t know, beating Hillary was fun,” he said to roars. “Remember, she was a nasty person. I was going to use a B word. I said, ‘my wife would not be happy.’”\n\nThere are plenty of Trump advisers who would prefer the president focus more on the here-and-now, or — even better — the what’s-to-come. As he loses his political edge on the economy, many of his allies worry he’s lost touch with voter concerns and anxieties that propelled him into office in the first place.\n\nFriday’s rally was the latest in a roadshow of sorts that White House advisers have planned for Trump to hone his message on bringing down prices. He also delivered a primetime address to the nation this week meant to drive the message.\n\nMuch of his argument rests on having inherited what he says was an economic disaster from Joe Biden, though inflation was at 3% when he took office and is now only slightly lower. (And economists cautioned that last month’s inflation dip had a lot to do with shutdown-related distortions of economic data.)\n\nYet as is so often the case, the intended content of Trump’s speech was a target that didn’t always find an arrow.\n\nAs he hit the hour mark, his grievance list grew, encompassing the news media and Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the onetime loyalist who has dramatically broken with him and whom Trump now calls “Marjorie Traitor Brown.”\n\nHis aside about Melania’s unmentionables came amid a diatribe over the investigations that plagued him during his time out of office. He mused about awarding himself a massive sum in connection with complaints he filed against the Justice Department.\n\n“I am suing and I’m the one that’s supposed to settle. So maybe I’ll give myself $1 billion and give it all to charity,” he said.\n\nTrump found ample distractions in the crowd, including a group of glamorous women from the western part of the state who volunteer at his events. When he spotted a hat he liked, he explained how he could gauge its value.\n\n“I want gold thread, not mustard color. You know?” he said. “When you have a mustard-colored thread, don’t accept it.”\n\nRecalling the times he came to purchase furniture in North Carolina as a hotelier, he explained the exacting nature of the task.\n\n“The arm of a chair was very important to me. I said, ‘I like that chair, but this arm has to be a different shape,’” he said. He kept going: “I’m a very aesthetic person, believe me, except with women, I don’t care what a woman looks like. I used to say beautiful. Now I don’t care.”\n\nHe spent several minutes discussing his physical health amid questions about his stamina after appearing to doze off during multiple on-camera events recently. He pointed to the string of cognitive tests he claims to have aced. And he pledged to alert the nation should he find himself in decline.\n\n“When that time comes, I will let you know about it. In fact, you’ll probably find out about it just by watching,” he said. “But that time is not now, because I feel the same that I felt for 50 years.”\n\nIt was, in the end, the same type of speech Trump has been delivering now for more than 10 years, the “weave” in which he takes great pride. It has less to do with a calculated political message than free-association of whatever’s on his mind — which is often the people or entities he thinks have done him wrong.\n\nIf some of his fixations cause heartburn among his allies, though, Trump has a different view.\n\n“I think I’m probably very neurotic,” he said in Rocky Mount. “I always say controlled neuroses is good. Being neurotic, no good. But if it’s controlled, that’s okay. It gives you some energy.”",

    "description": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.",
    "fullText": "Democrats’ fear-mongering about the Trump economy is looking more and more like sour grapes.\n\nYesterday’s CPI report, showing inflation of 2.7 percent — well below the expected 3.1 percent — was bad political news for Democrats. Since “Liberation Day” in April, when President Trump rolled out tariffs aimed at resetting global trade in favor of U.S. companies, the left and their media allies have warned voters that the White House’s actions would clobber our economy and set inflation soaring.\n\nIt hasn’t happened. The tariffs have only modestly boosted prices. Instead, the Trump agenda of higher energy production, lower budget deficits and lighter regulation has brought inflation down. While inflation averaged 5 percent annually under former President Joe Biden, and in four years jumped by nearly 22 percent, as of November it is rising at 2.7 percent.\n\nWould you remind me again who created the “affordability crisis?”\n\nAs inflation continues to recede from the lofty 9 percent level recorded under Biden, voters may realize just how much damage was done by Joe’s budget-busting big government spending.\n\nAnother narrative that is under fire is that Trump-backed AI is a gift to billionaires but is going to destroy U.S. employment, much like the trade pacts of the 1990s that sent jobs overseas. But two new studies counter that claim. As it turns out, AI is actually creating jobs for Americans.\n\nIn its year-end note to investors, investment firm Vanguard writes that AI is not responsible for slowing job growth. They point to data showing that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”\n\nAccompanying graphs show hiring in AI-affected occupations growing at 1.7 percent during the two years mid-2023 to mid-2025, compared to only 1.0 percent pre-COVID, and compared to 0.8 percent for other kinds of jobs. Similarly, real wage growth for AI-involved hires is advancing at 3.8 percent, compared to 0.7 percent for other occupations.\n\nThe authors of the study suggest that “current AI systems are generally enhancing worker productivity and shifting workers’ tasks toward higher-value activities.”",

    "description": "Several key Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Josh Hawley, have been outspoken against federal AI preemption.",
    "fullText": "Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida — a 2024 GOP primary opponent of Trump's — has been a consistent critic of federal efforts to curtail states' ability to regulate AI.\n\nAs lawmakers considered adding an AI regulation moratorium to the annual defense bill in November, DeSantis wrote on X that doing so is a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"\n\n\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment,\" DeSantis wrote. \"Denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild.\"\n\nFollowing Trump's executive order, DeSantis said at an AI roundtable event in Florida that he was confident that it wouldn't apply to laws that the governor is pursuing in his state.\n\nBut he said that if the administration did try to challenge Florida laws, he would expect the state to prevail.\n\n\"Even reading it very broadly, I think the stuff we're doing is going to be very consistent,\" DeSantis said of the executive order. \"But irrespective, clearly we have a right to do this.\"\n\nAs Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene began to break with the president over the summer, one of the issues the Georgia Republican highlighted was AI.\n\nGreene notably admitted to voting for an initial version of the \"Big Beautiful Bill\" without realizing that it contained a provision to block state AI regulation for AI.\n\n\"I am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in there,\" Greene wrote on X in June.\n\nFull transparency, I did not know about this section on pages 278-279 of the OBBB that strips states of the right to make laws or regulate AI for 10 years.\n\nI am adamantly OPPOSED to this and it is a violation of state rights and I would have voted NO if I had known this was in… pic.twitter.com/bip3hztSGq\n\nThe Georgia Republican re-upped her criticism when the provision was under consideration for the annual defense bill in November.\n\n\"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state,\" Greene wrote on X. \"Federalism must be preserved.\"\n\nJust days later, Greene announced that she would resign from Congress on January 5 after Trump called her a \"traitor,\" largely over her stance on the Epstein files.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley has been one of the biggest GOP critics of the AI industry in the Senate — and he's opposed efforts to restrict states from regulating the technology.\n\n\"I would think that, just as a matter of federalism, we'd want states to be able to try out different regimes that they think will work for their state,\" Hawley told Business Insider in June. \"And I think in general, on AI, I do think we need some sensible oversight that will protect people's liberties.\"\n\nWhen the AI provision was reported to be no longer under consideration for the defense bill in November, Hawley celebrated via a post on X.\n\n\"Good. This is a terrible provision and should remain OUT,\" he wrote.\n\nIn June, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas — who served as the White House Press Secretary during Trump's first term — led a group of 17 Republican governors in opposing an AI moratorium in the \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"\n\nThat provision in that bill was stronger than Trump's executive order — it would have amounted to a more wholesale ban on state-level AI regulation for a period of 10 years.\n\nSanders also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post opposing the plan.\n\n\"That Congress proposes to strip away the right of any state to regulate AI is the antithesis of what our founders envisioned when they established our federal system,\" she wrote in June.\n\nIn November, as lawmakers considered adding a similar provision to the defense bill, Sanders spoke up again.\n\n\"Now isn't the time to backtrack,\" she wrote on X. \"Drop the preemption plan now and protect our kids and communities.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox of Utah, among the GOP governors who signed onto Sanders' letter, has also remained outspoken against efforts to limit state-level AI regulation.\n\n\"I'm very worried about any type of federal incursion into states' abilities to regulate AI,\" Cox told NPR in November.\n\nIn December, as Trump prepared to sign his executive order, Cox said there was a need for more balance.\n\n\"An alternative AI executive order focused on human flourishing would strike the balance we need: safeguard our kids, preserve our values, and strengthen American competitiveness,\" Cox wrote on X. \"States must help protect children and families while America accelerates its leadership in AI.\"",

    "title": "Trump Announces Pricing Deals with Nine Drugmakers",
    "description": "The companies were the latest to agree to sell drugs to Medicaid and directly to consumers at discounted prices. President Trump said he would soon begin similar negotiations with health insurers.",
    "fullText": "President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.\n\nMr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement were Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.\n\nDrugmakers have been eager to strike deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.\n\nIn a White House briefing announcing the deals, Mr. Trump and top health officials framed the agreements as part of a focus on affordability at a time when the administration is facing intense scrutiny for not doing more to stem rising prices.\n\nThe announcements were made as health insurance subsidies in the Obamacare marketplace were set to expire at the end of the year, which will likely to drive up premiums for millions of Americans.\n\nStanding at the podium, the president also took the opportunity to threaten the health insurance industry. Mr. Trump said he would call insurance executives to Florida or the White House soon to discuss lowering premiums.\n\n“They have to make less, a lot less,” he said. Stocks of major insurers, including UnitedHealth Group, CVS and Cigna, fell after Mr. Trump’s remarks.\n\n“Health plans are doing everything in their power to shield Americans from the high and rising costs of medical care, and we welcome any opportunity to discuss common-sense solutions to lower costs for everyone,” said Mike Tuffin, chief executive of AHIP, a major trade group for health insurance plans.\n\nUnder the deals announced on Friday, manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy certain products. The offerings have focused on drugs often prescribed by primary care doctors rather than more specialized, expensive treatments for conditions like cancer.\n\nTo help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the drugmakers’ own websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.\n\nDrugs that will be made available in this way include Amgen’s Repatha, for lowering cholesterol, at $239 a month; GSK’s asthma inhaler, Advair Diskus, at $89 a month; and Merck’s diabetes medication Januvia, at $100 a month.\n\nMany of these drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection, meaning that the arrival of low-cost generic competition would soon have prompted manufacturers to lower their prices.\n\nIn other cases, the direct-buy offerings are very expensive and out of reach for most Americans.\n\nFor example, Gilead will offer Epclusa, a three-month regimen of pills that cures hepatitis C, for $2,492 a month on the site. Most patients pay far less using insurance or with help from patient assistance programs. Gilead says on its website that “typically a person taking Epclusa pays between $0 and $5 per month” with commercial insurance or Medicare.\n\nThe drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.\n\nAnd the companies agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.\n\nPeople on Medicaid already pay nothing or very little in out-of-pocket costs. Federal law caps those costs at $8 per prescription for people with the lowest incomes.\n\nMedicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries.\n\nStill, administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drug purchases. Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide Eliquis, a widely used blood thinner, to Medicaid for free.\n\nA new, lower price for Medicare of $231 per month, enabled by a Biden-era law, will go into effect in January. Medicaid’s current prices for Eliquis are not public, and Bristol Myers Squibb did not return a request for comment on what it now charges Medicaid programs.\n\n“It’s very likely that Medicaid programs were already getting it for free or close to free,” said Dr. Benjamin Rome, a health policy researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nAs he has done while announcing the other drug pricing deals, Mr. Trump on Friday made claims about impossible price decreases of up to 800 percent. At another point, he boasted: “This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care by far.”\n\nAt least initially, most Americans won’t see changes to their out-of-pocket costs resulting from the deals. In some cases, they could end up paying more if they use their own money to go through TrumpRx when they could have paid less by relying on insurance.\n\n“The bottom line is that the agreements will not decrease prices for most Americans,” said Ameet Sarpatwari, who studies pharmaceutical policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nExecutives for each of the drugmakers appeared with Mr. Trump and other cabinet officials in the White House’s Roosevelt Room. They arrived long before him, standing awkwardly on live video until his arrival. When Mr. Trump entered the room, he began the event by displaying and touting his new “gold card” — a way for immigrants to obtain visas for $1 million each, plus processing fees.\n\nAfter his initial remarks, the pharmaceutical executives each gave a short speech. Most thanked the president, saying it was an honor to lower their prices.\n\nIn exchange for some lower prices, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might have imposed on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to levy punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.\n\nThe three major drugmakers that have yet to reach deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Representatives for those companies all said they were still in talks with the administration.\n\nMr. Trump said that Johnson & Johnson and a few other companies would announce price-cutting deals in the coming days.\n\nIn the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in other wealthy nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.\n\nThe deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market that are covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Trump unsuccessfully tried to use regulation to force drugmakers to lower some Medicare prices to the levels in European countries. A federal court blocked the effort, ruling that the administration had skipped steps in the policymaking process. But had it been carried out, it would have been a major change in how the United States pays for medicines.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration posted documents online proposing a very different, and more modest, version of the international price comparison idea.\n\nManufacturers are required to pay a rebate to Medicare when they increase certain prices faster than the rate of inflation. Currently, those rebates are calculated based on drug prices in the United States.\n\nUnder the new proposed rules, called GLOBE and GUARD, the government would test an approach that would instead calculate those rebates based on drug prices in other wealthy countries.\n\nJuliette Cubanski, a Medicare expert at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, said such a change could lead to “relatively modest” savings for Medicare. Still, she said, “I’m not sure it represents a substantially more significant threat to drug industry revenues than the existing inflation rebate program does.”\n\nReed Abelson contributed reporting.",

There were several photos of Clinton among the thousands of documents made public.  Another photo shows him in a pool with Epstein’s longtime confidant, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and a person whose face was also redacted.",

    "description": "The Kennedy Center added Donald Trump's name to its facade on Friday. Here's a look back at how it came to be and how it has changed under Trump.",
    "fullText": "With his White House renovations already underway, President Donald Trump is now leaving his mark on the Kennedy Center.\n\nThe day after the Kennedy Center's board of trustees voted to change the name, new signage appeared on the building's facade on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\nOriginally established by Congress in 1958 as an \"artistic mecca\" for the performing arts in the nation's capital, the National Cultural Center was officially renamed in memory of President John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963. Since its opening in 1971, the center has hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as a range of events and exhibits across genres.\n\nSince the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, changing its name requires congressional approval. That hasn't stopped the Center's Trump-appointed board from implementing the change on the building as well as its website. Whether the name sticks remains to be seen.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how the Center came to be and its changes under Trump's leadership so far.\n\nOriginally named the National Cultural Center, the act authorized the construction of the building and established it as an independent institution with a mission to host arts and culture events, as well as educational programming.\n\nKennedy Onassis and Mamie Eisenhower served as honorary co-chairwomen of the project.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act in January 1964 to change the name and provide $23 million in federal funds for its construction.\n\nAfter signing the bill, Johnson handed the pen to Edward Kennedy, John F. Kennedy's brother.\n\n\"As this center comes to reflect and advance the greatness of America, consider then those glories were purchased by a valiant leader who never swerved from duty — John Kennedy. And in his name I dedicate this site,\" Johnson said at the groundbreaking ceremony, held in December 1964.\n\nDesigned by architect Edward Durell Stone, the Kennedy Center was built on the banks of the Potomac River using 3,700 tons of marble gifted to the US from Italy.\n\nFor its opening event, the Kennedy Center hosted a performance of \"Mass\" by Leonard Bernstein, which was commissioned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\n\nThe first Kennedy Center honorees included Fred Astaire, Marian Anderson, George Balanchine, Arthur Rubinstein, and Richard Rodgers.\n\nBeyoncé brought the Kennedy Center to its feet with a fiery tribute to Tina Turner in 2005, and President Barack Obama shed tears while watching Aretha Franklin perform \"Natural Woman\" to honor Carole King in 2015.\n\nTrump did not attend the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term, but has taken a much more active role in shaping the institution in his second non-consecutive term.\n\nAfter taking office earlier this year, he fired the president and Biden-appointed members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, replacing them with allies and members of his administration. The board went on to elect Trump as its chairman.\n\nWhile visiting the performance venue in March, Trump told board members that the building was in \"bad shape\" and said he planned to renovate the space.\n\n\"We're going to make a lot of changes, including the seats, the décor, pretty much everything needs a lot of work,\" he said.\n\nAt the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, held on December 7, honorees received newly designed medallions from Tiffany, featuring blue ribbons instead of the traditional rainbow colors.\n\nOn Thursday, the White House announced that the board had \"unanimously\" voted to change the name from the Kennedy Center to the Trump Kennedy Center, and the website was updated to reflect the change.\n\nTrump's name was added to the building's signage on Friday, reading \"The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.\"\n\n\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"\n\nTrump said he was \"honored,\" while Democratic lawmakers and members of the Kennedy family criticized the president.\n\nKennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, contested the White House's claim of a unanimous vote, writing on X that \"microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous,\" while Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, wrote on X that the change is not acceptable.\n\nSix Democratic lawmakers said in a statement that Trump was \"attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Rep. Elise Stefanik announced Friday that she is suspending her campaign for New York governor and will not seek reelection to Congress, abruptly bowing out of what was expected to be a bruising Republican primary and ending a once-promising tenure in the House.\n\nStefanik, an ally of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that she was confident of her chances in the Republican primary for governor against Bruce Blakeman, a county official in New York City’s suburbs. But she said, “It is not an effective use of our time” to stay in the race, and that she instead wants to spend more time with her young son and family.\n\n“I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness — particularly at his tender age,” she said.\n\nStefanik was set to have a tough race against Blakeman, with both politicians counting themselves as allies of Trump and attempting to court his support. Though, the president had seemed keen on avoiding picking a side in the race, telling reporters recently: “He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people.”\n\nOn Friday, Trump, writing on his Truth Social media platform, called Stefanik a “fantastic person and congresswoman.”\n\n“Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!” Trump wrote.\n\nStefanik, who represents a conservative congressional district in northern New York, has been an intense critic of incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is also seeking reelection but faces a primary challenge from her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.\n\nFollowing Stefanik's exit, Hochul's campaign spokesperson said, “If you run against Governor Kathy Hochul, you are going to lose.\"\n\nStefanik was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress when she won her first campaign in 2014 at just 30 years old, representing a new generation of Republicans making inroads in Washington. She ultimately rose to her party’s leadership in the House when she became the chair of the House Republican Conference in 2021.\n\nFirst viewed as a moderate when she came to Washington, Stefanik became far more conservative as Trump began to dominate the party. Once someone who refused to say Trump’s name, she became one of his top defenders during his first impeachment inquiry. She would go on to vote against certifying the 2020 election results, even after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s narrow margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor.\n\nStefanik’s decision follows a clash with Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she accused of lying before embarking on a series of media interviews criticizing him. In one with The Wall Street Journal, she called Johnson a “political novice” and said he wouldn’t be reelected speaker if the vote were held today.\n\nThe tumultuous early December episode appeared to cool when Johnson said he and Stefanik had a “great talk.”\n\n“I called her and I said, ‘Why wouldn’t you just come to me, you know?’” Johnson said. “So we had some intense fellowship about that.”\n\nStill, Stefanik, the chairwoman of the House Republican leadership, has not fully walked back her criticisms. A Dec. 2 social media post remains online in which, after a provision she championed was omitted from a defense authorization bill, Stefanik accused Johnson of falsely claiming he was unaware of it, calling it “more lies from the Speaker.”\n\nBlakeman, the executive of Nassau County on Long Island, released a statement Friday night that thanked Stefanik “for her outstanding service to the people of New York and to all Americans.”\n\n“I am ready to work hand-in-hand with the Congresswoman and all New Yorkers to restore accountability, affordability, and safety to state government,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A storied Wall Street law firm that hemorrhaged talent after bending the knee to President Donald Trump has announced plans to merge with a much larger firm in a bid to save its practice.\n\nCadwalader, Wickersham & Taft had been actively looking for a merger partner after many of its top attorneys left over the firm’s decision to pledge $100 million in pro bono work to support the president’s priorities, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nLast spring, the president signed a series of executive orders stripping attorneys from certain firms of their security clearances, limiting their access to government buildings, and terminating government contracts with the firms.\n\nWhile some firms like Cadwalader made deals with the administration to avoid a similar punishment, others fought the orders and won big in court, adding to the humiliation of the capitulating firms.\n\nIn the wake of the firm’s deal with Trump, key partner groups at Cadwalader, which was founded in 1792 and is Wall Street’s oldest firm, quickly began making lateral moves to other practices, Above the Law reported.\n\nThe firm, which brings in about $638 million in annual revenue, is now merging with Hogan Lovells, which brought in nearly $3 billion last year, more than quadruple the size of Cadwalader, according to Above the Law.\n\nHogan Lovells’ chief executive, Miguel Zaldivar Jr., will lead the combined firm, according to the Journal. Cadwalader’s current co-managing partners will be relegated to the new firm’s management committee.\n\nPartners at both firms still need to vote to finalize the merger next year.\n\nThe deal is being described as the legal industry’s largest-ever merger, creating a $3.6 billion megafirm with more than 3,000 lawyers, according to the Journal.\n\nHogan Lovells is headquartered in London and Washington, D.C.\n\nCommenting on the merger, Zaldivar said Wall Street had long been the firm’s “missing piece,” telling the Journal, “We felt that we needed to consolidate our position with a strong finance practice in New York.”\n\n“It’s a deal that makes perfect sense,” he added.\n\nDespite being burned by its prior dealings with Trump, Cadwalader co-managing partner Pat Quinn reaffirmed the company’s commitment to pro bono legal work in a statement shared by Reuters.\n\nHowever, he declined to say whether the firm’s previous deal with the administration would apply to the merged firm.\n\nLast year, another famous Wall Street firm, Shearman & Sterling, merged with Allen & Overy to create a $3.4 billion business. Chicago-based firm Winston & Strawn also announced plans on Monday to merge with U.K. practice Taylor Wessing in 2026.",
