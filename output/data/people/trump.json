    "fullText": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images (L)/Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images (R)\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) went scorched earth on President Donald Trump in a New York Times profile on Monday, trashing the president’s claim to a Christian faith and singling out her stand on the Epstein files as what sent him over the edge.\n\nGreene, who spent years as a staunch Trump loyalist, recounted her break with the president to Times reporter Robert Draper, claiming that she was “naïve” for having been part of what she called a “toxic” political culture she said she found to be at odds with her Christian faith.\n\nHaving now found herself branded a “traitor” by the president and his most awkward Republican critic, Greene explained that her break with Trump sharpened after the September killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which she recalled as a pivotal moment.\n\nWatching Kirk’s memorial service, Greene said she was struck by the contrast between the forgiveness of Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, and Trump’s onstage remarks that, unlike Kirk, he chooses to “hate” his “opponent.”\n\n“It just shows where his heart is,” she later texted Draper, adding: “It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”\n\nGreene told the Times the episode forced a reckoning with the brawler persona she said Trump had helped normalize and that she had participated in.\n\n“Our side has been trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong,” she said. “You just keep pummeling your enemies, no matter what. And as a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that. I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.”\n\n“After Charlie died,” Greene told Draper on another occasion. “I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”\n\nFrom Trump’s perspective, Greene insisted, the real rupture was her stand on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n“It was Epstein. Epstein was everything,” she told the Times.\n\nGreene pushed to force the release of investigative material, arguing it symbolised elite impunity: “Rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims.”\n\nThe break gave way to wider criticism of what she believed was the divergence of Trump and congressional Republicans from America First policy making, which irked fellow Republican lawmakers and resulted in the president branding her a “traitor.”\n\n“Am I going to get murdered, or one of my kids, because he’s calling me a traitor?” she said she asked herself after a pipe bomb threat and an anonymous email targeting her son.\n\nSoon after she announced she would be retiring from Congress, yet throughout she insisted that she did not change — MAGA did.\n\n“Everyone’s like, ‘She’s changed,’” Greene said to Draper. “I haven’t changed my views. But I’ve matured. I’ve developed depth.”\n\nShe added: “I’ve learned Washington, and I’ve come to understand the brokenness of the place. If none of us is learning lessons here and we can’t evolve and mature with our lessons, then what kind of people are we?”\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Goes Scorched Earth on Trump in Splashy NYT Feature — Claims ‘He Does Not Have Any Faith’ and Her Epstein Stand Was Last Straw first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "The talk of a new Middle East is belied by Israel’s attacks on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\n\nNo foreign leader has easier access to President Donald Trump than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose scheduled meeting today at Mar-a-Lago will be the fifth time he’s hobnobbed with the US president in the past 10 months. In February, Netanyahu was the first overseas dignitary to visit the White House in Trump’s second term, and now the year ends with another meeting. Few foreign leaders have buttered up Trump with the aplomb of Netanyahu, who describes Trump as Israel’s “greatest friend.”\n\nIn Trump’s first four years in office, these enthusiastic words were more than earned. As Al Jazeera noted, “During his first term, Trump pushed US policy further in favour of Israel’s right-wing government. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied Golan Heights and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).”\n\nThe situation in Trump’s second term is more complicated. Small but significant disagreements have opened up between Israel and the United States. Trump’s push for a foreign policy more focused on the Western Hemisphere—which includes bombing putative drug boats and threatening regime change in Venezuela—depends on shifting military resources away from Europe and the Middle East. In the National Security Strategy release in November, the Trump administration argued that the Middle East is “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship and investment.” Ironically, Trump’s pursuit of a pivot away from the Middle East is a continuation of unsuccessful efforts for a lighter US footprint in the region pursued by his predecessors Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nTrump’s peace plans for the region have a pie-in-the-sky feel. They would entail the United States offshoring its military presence while pushing for a closer integration of its Arab allies with Israel and the emergence of a new government in Gaza. As Roger Cohen, Paris bureau chief for The New York Times, dryly noted, “Such optimism, based in large part on the Gaza peace agreement signed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, looks overblown, much like President Trump’s claim that day that it took 3,000 years to reach a breakthrough of this kind.”\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to Trump’s vision of a new Middle East is that Israel is having none of it. While Trump touts his ceasefire, Israel has continued to bomb Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. In his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to push for a renewed bombing campaign against Iran as well.\n\nNetanyahu has no interest in the Middle East becoming a place of “partnership, friendship and investment.” Rather, the Israeli leader’s strategy is clearly one of maintaining regional hegemony by promoting chaos. This is the tried-and-true imperialist method of divide-and-conquer.\n\nThe conflicting goals of the United States and Israel can be most clearly seen in Syria. Cohen argues that there is ground for hope in the end of the civil war in Syria, with a unified nation now being rebuilt under the leadership of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadi who has pursued a policy of reconciliation. As Cohen noted:\n\nRemarkable progress has, however, also been made in a year. Mr. al-Sharaa has garnered support from the United States, Russia and China. He has secured the lifting of economic sanctions. He has remained steady in the face of repeated military provocations from Israel, and has begun to lay the basis of state institutions. He has been embraced by Mr. Trump and was ushered to the White House last month.\n\nUnfortunately, while Israel and its Arab allies are backing Syrian reconstruction, Netanyahu’s government is seeking security by keeping Syria divided. On December 23, a Washington Post report documented that Israel had been arming Druze militiamen in Syria who want a separate state. According to the report, “Some Israeli and American analysts argue that Israel’s aggressive use of military force in Syria and its clandestine efforts to promote Druze separatism were counterproductive and undercut relations at a time when Sharaa appeared eager to reach a diplomatic détente.”\n\nDana Stroul, a former senior Pentagon official, told the Washington Post:\n\n“There has been growing frustration in Washington that Israeli actions were setting back something most of Washington and everyone in the Middle East would actually like to see succeed: a stabilized, unified Syria. The basic argument to Israel is, look, you actually have leaders in Damascus who are willing to say the word ‘Israel’ and talk about a potential future with normalized relations, yet you just keep bombing or looking for a surrogate to work through.”\n\nTrump styles himself as an American First nationalist. There is every reason to oppose Israel’s belligerent foreign policy in terms of American national interest as well as on the grounds of international peace. It’s hard to find any rational benefit for the United States in Syria sinking back into chaos or in Iran being bombed. Further, criticism of Israel’s belligerence is rising not just among liberals but also on the MAGA right, with voices such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson warning of the dangers of more Middle Eastern wars.\n\nDespite this shifting political landscape, there’s no reason to put any faith in Trump standing up to Netanyahu. Everything in Trump’s record indicates his handling of foreign policy is fundamentally feckless and that he’s easily swayed by hawkish voices who remain powerful inside the Republican Party. While there are areas of disagreements between Netanyahu and Trump, the more crucial difference is between how invested each is in their policy preferences. Netanyahu is heavily invested in his vision of Israel as a hegemonic power in the Middle East that is willing to spread chaos to fend off any possible foe. Trump, by contrast, has no deep policy commitments, which makes him vulnerable to the suasion of Netanyahu and the pro-Israel lobby. Trump’s peace plans are a flimsy house of cards, which Netanyahu will easily topple.\n\nIn this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year.\n\nAnother world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!",

    "description": "Dr. Oz's remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean.",
    "fullText": "“We’ve dropped (the price of) the infertility drugs to make lots of Trump babies, I’m hoping by the midterms.” That bizarre remark was made recently by Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nAfter four years of the first Trump administration and nearly one year into the second, many of us have become desensitized to this kind of commentary – but not Black women. We know the quiet part spoken out loud when we hear it.\n\nDr. Oz’s remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean. This administration will stop at nothing to ensure the political dominance of White people in this country.\n\n“Trump babies” born ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 won’t vote until 2044, but after decades of listening to phrases like “welfare queens,” we know a dog whistle when we hear one. To understand this moment, it helps to look across generations.\n\nMore than 60 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. One cannot underestimate the impact of that generation’s monumental moment on what’s happening today.\n\nThis seminal 1965 pair of laws “democratized the idea of who could be an American” and who could vote, as recently reported by The New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb.\n\nOpinion: Americans are shifting away from wanting kids. I'm worried for my generation.\n\nTwenty years from now, the White population in America will fall below 50%. Non-White births already exceed those of White Americans, and non-White children under age 15 already outnumber White children.\n\nThat reality should usher in a more inclusive democracy. Instead, White supremacists see it as an existential threat.\n\nThe MAGA movement intends to preserve power at all costs. Its four-part plan for stopping this demographic tsunami includes voter suppression, undermining reproductive justice, drastically reducing the number of non-White children who grow up to be voters through targeted deportations and incentivizing U.S. births among “traditional families.”\n\nFirst is the strategic disenfranchisement of Black and Latino voters by gutting the Voting Rights Act, culling us from voter lists and gerrymandering the elimination of congressional seats representing Black and Brown constituencies.\n\nSecond is pricing out low-income parents from having the economic and reproductive autonomy to choose their family sizes. The cost to raise a U.S. child born in 2015 to age 18 is estimated to be $320,000, and with families of color facing disproportionate levels of poverty, slashing safety net programs will only make it harder for people in our communities to have children.\n\nIn fact, recent state polling from In Our Own Voice found that financial insecurity is a top concern among Black adults as to why they are not growing their families. This will only be exacerbated as federal budget cuts and inflation make basic necessities like childcare, shelter and nutrition increasingly out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the poor quality of care in our health system, underscored by the recent experiences of two Black women, Karrie Jones in Texas and Mercedes Wells in Indiana, both of whom were dismissed while in active labor, shows how dangerous and unequal the path to parenthood has become.\n\nSlashing Medicaid for millions will cripple critical care for more than a quarter of Black and Latina women, more than half of Black girls and, in a shift too significant to ignore, two-thirds of Black births.\n\nThird, we are witnessing our government’s brutal kidnappings and deportations of Black and Brown immigrants of reproductive age and their children. Along with attacking birthright citizenship, limiting international student visas and admitting only White Afrikaners as refugees, these nativist policies set the stage for shrinking pathways for America’s non-White population.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nAnd fourth, White families must have more babies. While the administration’s early ideas – a $1,000 “baby bonus” and medals for mothers of six – may sound harmless, they point to the concerning rise of America’s pronatalism movement.\n\nWith unmistakable echoes of eugenics, its White, religious, conservative champions are pushing for more births among married, heterosexual couples and for children engineered for high intelligence and other so-called desirable traits.\n\nIn this context, the push for a new generation of “Trump babies” fits squarely within a broader strategy to dictate who gets to be born, who gets to stay and who ultimately gets to participate in American democracy.\n\nOpinion: Liberals aren't having kids, conservatives are. That matters.\n\nIt’s long past time for the opposition to stop reacting to executive orders, shutdowns and political theater and start listening to Black women. The “Trump babies” remark and ideology foreshadow a weakened and deeply unequal democracy.\n\nSo let’s call this what it is: a generational war by those clinging to power to “Make America Great Again” by preserving White dominance of American political, economic and cultural life; dramatically reducing Black and Latinobirths andsuffrage;and neutralizing a demographic tipping point that will permanently end White majority in the United States.\n\nBecause this is a generational strategy, it demands a generational response – one rooted in truth, organized power and an unwavering commitment to the dignity, agency and futures of Black, Brown and immigrant communities.\n\nRegina Davis Moss, a public health expert and author with a specialty in Black maternal health, is president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY columnists and other writers on the Opinion front page, on X, formerly Twitter, @usatodayopinion and in our Opinion newsletter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Trump babies' reveal GOP's long game: Voter suppression | Opinion",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbor’s land by force.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are “closer than ever before” to a peace settlement.\n\nNegotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration’s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.\n\nAt recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.\n\nExperts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.\n\nBut as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.\n\nTalks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.\n\nSouth Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.\n\nStill, it's unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nPower transition sparks climate goals\n\nSouth Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.\n\n“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nSouth Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.\n\n“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSouth Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal\n\nThe South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.\n\nAs part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.\n\nThe agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.\n\nLNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.\n\nSouth Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.\n\n“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,\" Lee said.\n\nRenewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.\n\nJapan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.\n\nClean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.\n\nNuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.\n\n“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.\n\nIn early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.\n\nSouth Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.\n\nMany global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.\n\n“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nCoal trade braces for South Korea cuts\n\nAt last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.\n\nThat's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”\n\nSouth Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.\n\nThe pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”\n\n“The writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "description": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners \"excited\" to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.",
    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump did not have a merry Christmas.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the 79-year-old president labored through a Mar-a-Lago dinner with his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, and his father-in-law, Viktor Knavs. Then he fired off nearly 150 Truth Social posts filled with complaints and angry rants instead of enjoying time with his friends and family.\n\nTrump biographer Michael Wolff joined the Daily Beast’s Joanna Coles on their Inside Trump’s Head podcast and roasted the president’s cheerless holiday.\n\n“I assume that he sat up in bed and just went crazy,” joked Wolff.\n\nFor Coles, Wolff, and many social media onlookers, Trump’s Christmas Eve appeared lonely and miserable as Melania talked excitedly with her father while Trump stared blankly into space.\n\n“What was notable about the videos that people were posting from the event was how animated our First Lady looked with her father, when we are not used to seeing her looking remotely animated,” remarked Coles.\n\n“And just to set the scene, they are on the Mar-a-Lago terrace. I imagine it’s about 75 degrees,” added Wolff. “It is filled with other members. We’re in the high season now, actually. And why these people are not having their Christmas Eve with their families, we can only guess.”\n\nWolff remarked on how isolated Trump looked from the festivities around him.\n\n“Donald Trump is where he always is: at the table in the center, with a red rope around his table. Why there is this red rope around his table is kind of confusing, because the table is right in the center of everything,” he said.\n\n“Maybe it’s like the brim of Melania’s hat,” said Coles. “It gives him a sort of perimeter around which you shouldn’t lean in.”\n\n“Everybody on the terrace comes up to him. It’s not as if it says, ‘Stay away.’ Actually, it’s ‘Come a little closer,’ is what the rope means,” added Wolff.\n\nThough Wolff and Coles painted a grim picture of Trump’s sad Christmas Eve, their vision of his Christmas morning was even sadder.\n\n“I think he was watching television, right?” mused Coles. “He wakes up, and his banks of televisions are still going because he didn’t switch them off the night before, unless someone slips into his room and switches them off for him.”\n\n“He’s in the White House, or he’s in Mar-a-Lago,” added Wolff. “And I think they’re probably both very, very similar. I think he arranges these things to basically look the same, and he does the same thing.”\n\nWolff suggested that Trump, chafed from being isolated on Christmas Eve and spending all night lashing out on Truth Social, likely spent his Christmas morning begging people to talk to him about himself.\n\n“What’s the most important thing to Donald Trump? What is his lifeline?” asked Wolff. ”Calls. He makes calls. He takes calls, and he makes calls. You know, he gets on the phone, and he says, ‘What’s happening? How’s it playing?’ Which is all an invitation to talk about him, of course.\"\n\nAsked to comment on Trump’s Christmas activities, the White House ignored the question and repeated the same comment it has given for multiple Inside Trump’s Head episodes.\n\nThe comment, attributed to White House Communications Director Steven Cheung, reads, “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "description": "From Trump's comments about annexing Canada to a Canadian boycott of American goods, here is how one of the strongest relationships cracked in 2025.",
    "fullText": "It's been a rough year for the friendship between the countries that share the world's longest undefended border.\n\nRelationships between the US and other countries frayed in 2025, but no more than between America and its neighbor to the north, which is also its second-largest trading partner.\n\nFrom comments about annexing Canada to ceasing trade negotiations over a provincial advertisement, here is a play-by-play of how the US and Canada's relationship cracked in 2025.\n\nThe last significant invasion of Canadian territories was more than two hundred years ago, and no US president has since publicly and repeatedly discussed making the northern neighbor a state of America.\n\nThat is, until Trump began to float the idea of making Canada America's 51st state in January.\n\nA few weeks before Trump's inauguration, he was asked if he was considering using military force to acquire Canada during a press briefing in Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"No, economic force,\" he said. \"Because Canada and the United States, that would really be something.\"\n\nHe went on to tell reporters the US-Canadian border is an \"artificially drawn line\" and said he would impose a 25% tariff on the neighbor.\n\nTrump's idea received swift backlash from Canadians and the then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who posted on X that \"there isn't a snowball's chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States.\"\n\nThe rebuff did not deter Trump from reiterating his suggestion in subsequent press appearances and interviews.\n\nWhereas Trump's tariffs on China and much of Asia are unsurprising, and previous presidents have occasionally imposed targeted duties on the European Union, his levies on Canada have sent shockwaves across the continent.\n\nIn early February, Trump signed an executive order using emergency economic powers to impose a 25% tariff on Canadian goods, alongside a separate 10% tariff on some energy resources.\n\nTrump alleged that the flow of fentanyl from the Canadian border into the US was a reason for the tariffs, but data from US Customs and Border Protection shows that the northern neighbor accounted for 0.2% of US border fentanyl seizures.\n\nThen, within days, the tariffs that were slated to take effect on February 4 were paused for 30 days after Trump spoke to Trudeau over the phone.\n\nCanadians have launched a mass boycott of everything American.\n\nStarting in March, Canadians canceled trips to the US in favor of Central American countries, labeled US imports with big \"T\" stickers in shops, sidelined American groceries in stores, and ceased importing American liquor in most provinces.\n\nMany American businesses, particularly those in the prolific bourbon and whiskey industry in Kentucky and Tennessee, are feeling the pain. Meanwhile, Canada's local economy is set to benefit from the \"Buy Canadian\" movement that swept the country.\n\nTrump may have cost Canada's Conservative Party an election win.\n\nPierre Poilievre, once the clear favorite to become prime minister based on polls, saw his campaign collapse after Trump escalated tariffs.\n\nPoilievre's Trump-style messaging, including the slogan \"Canada First,\" became a liability as voters rallied behind Liberal leader Mark Carney, who cast the race as a referendum on defending Canada from Washington's threats. The result handed the Liberals a stunning comeback victory in April and left the Conservatives facing their sharpest defeat in years.\n\nPoilievre, the populist Conservative leader, was eventually voted out of the parliamentary seat he had held for two decades.\n\nAfter not having as many deals as Trump initially expected, he announced that global tariffs on steel imports would double to 50% as of June 4. The move heavily impacted Canada, which supplies a substantial share of steel to the US, but it is also ominous news for the domestic housing industry, as steel tariffs would drive up the cost of constructing homes.\n\nCanada's provinces are finding new uses for stockpiled American liquor after pulling US alcohol from shelves in March.\n\nAt least four provinces plan to sell the remaining inventory and donate the proceeds to food banks, including Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.\n\nOther provinces are taking different approaches. Ontario said US alcohol will remain in storage, while British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories are continuing to sell existing stock until it runs out, but won't be ordering more.\n\nThe pullback has hit American distillers hard. The Distilled Spirits Council said that US spirits exports to Canada plunged 85% in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nAs of the end of the year, there is still no deal between the US and Canada, and some Canadian economists are in doubt about whether a deal is still necessary.\n\nWhile Canada initially expected a more serious hit to its economy from Trump's tariffs, the country reported higher-than-expected GDP growth in the third quarter, and it is ramping up efforts to diversify trade by looking toward Asia.\n\nCarlo Dade, the Director of International Policy at the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, previously told Business Insider that he would argue that Canada \"shouldn't be trying to get an agreement with the US\" at this point, because \"no one gets a good deal from Trump.\"",

    "fullText": "Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men’s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.\n\nIn the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.\n\nBut away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.\n\nHere, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O’Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.\n\nJames: Wimbledon, 1988. You can’t snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.\n\nAnka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.\n\nO’Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d’Or. \n\nFeringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.\n\nMiller: I don’t think I’ll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.\n\nMiller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I’ll never forget.\n\nO’Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.\n\nFeringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.\n\nJames: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.\n\nAnka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.\n\nMiller: Scott McTominay. One of football’s great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.\n\nO’Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.\n\nFeringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else’s villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.\n\nJames: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest’s 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.\n\nForest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn’t expect anything.”\n\nAnka: The two biggest games of McTominay’s 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland’s qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\nI undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.\n\nAlso, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don’t think there’s a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men’s game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he’s always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.\n\n“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz\n\n— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025\n\nMiller: It won’t do to overcomplicate these things, so it’s a toss-up between two.\n\nEither Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.\n\nOr Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.\n\nFeringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports’ Halo and Joey Barton.\n\nJames: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there’s plenty in between, too.\n\nAnka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.\n\nMiller: Troy Parrott’s miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can’t remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.\n\nO’Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England’s Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.\n\nFeringa: Gotham’s victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That’s silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.\n\nJames: Well, I certainly didn’t expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool’s 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah’s outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.\n\nAnka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.\n\nMiller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.\n\nO’Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…\n\nFeringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don’t know why everyone kept panicking. You don’t come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.\n\nJames: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest’s owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.\n\nAnka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.\n\nMiller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.\n\nO’Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.\n\nFeringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women’s Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).\n\nJames: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA’s decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.\n\nUEFA’s judgement was harsh but I wouldn’t go that far.\n\nAnyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I’ll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.\n\nYeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.\n\nAnka: The Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria’s Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco’s federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.\n\nMiller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski’s stoppage-time equaliser in the final men’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That’s Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.\n\nThe latest in a long line of Goodison Park heroes, James Tarkowski 🎬 pic.twitter.com/31v3dCZfQH\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) February 15, 2025\n\nO’Neill: I wasn’t there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.\n\nIt came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.\n\nFeringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.\n\nAitana's turn for the goal 🥵 #WEURO2025 pic.twitter.com/WbwTRCbyfJ\n\n— UEFA Women's EURO (@WEURO2025) July 23, 2025\n\nClose second: Jack Grealish’s first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I’d be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.\n\nJames: Paris Saint-Germain’s third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele’s backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.\n\nThe results are in for the best play of the year!\n\nThe winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!\n\nThank you for voting, the fun doesn’t stop here — more games and surprises are coming soon on https://t.co/HPYRKgym8v. Stay… pic.twitter.com/4SVAEDoPZg\n\n— Ballon d'Or (@ballondor) September 26, 2025\n\nJosh Tymon’s volley, for Snoop’s Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.\n\nAnka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…\n\nIn real life? Amad’s edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.\n\nOutrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) November 1, 2025\n\nWatching live on the telly? Declan Rice’s perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.\n\nMiller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I’m going to be like that. I’m going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”\n\nIt’s hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.\n\nO’Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women’s football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.\n\n“I spent some time playing men’s football. But it really wasn’t my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I’ve never looked back. It’s changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence.\n\n“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don’t care about the news. It’s my escape, and the fact that it’s trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”\n\nFeringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”\n\nAnge Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.\n\nJames: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”\n\nSurely Salah’s post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don’t say things like that.\n\nAs for No 2, I’ll go for Amorim’s assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.\n\n“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”\n\nIf only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.\n\nAnka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.\n\n“People might think I’m an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”\n\nMiller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they’ve served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.\n\nO’Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It’s just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this’?\n\nFeringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.\n\nJames: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.\n\nAnka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners’ medal.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Everton, Nottingham Forest, England, Scotland, Republic of Ireland, SSC Napoli, Premier League, Champions League, International Football, Serie A, Championship, Women's Soccer, FIFA Men's World Cup, League One, League Two, National League\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "With Donald Trump expanding the travel ban inspired by his first term in the White House to 20 more countries, as well as the Palestinian Authority, on Dec. 16, a total of 39 countries from different corners of the world now face either a total ban or restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nMali, South Sudan, Niger, Burkina Faso, Syria, and the Palestinian Authority have been added to the list of nations whose citizens cannot enter the U.S. at all, first introduced in June.\n\nAngola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Ivory Coast, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were meanwhile added to a list of countries facing a block on student and business visas; the list that Trump put in place in June 2025 previously included Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.\n\nImmediately after their nations were added to the ban, multiple diplomats and heads of state responded with condemnation. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a statement saying that the Caribbean country's government was \"deeply disappointed\" given that the justification accusing it of loose rules for granting citizenship by investment \"does not reflect the present reality of our laws.\"\n\nTwo weeks after the expansion of the ban, the West African nation of Niger has taken the most drastic step of permanently banning any granting of new visas to U.S. visas in a reciprocal measure until the situation changes.\n\n\"Niger is completely and permanently prohibiting the issuance of visas to all U.S. citizens and indefinitely banning entry to its territory for nationals of the United States,\" a governmental representative said to the Associated Press.\n\nA landlocked country bordered by Algeria, Libya, Chad, Nigeria, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is a Muslim-majority nation with a population of just over 25 million people. In the document announcing the travel ban, the White House said the country has a visa overstay rate of 13.41% for business visas and 16.46% for student ones as well as \"terrorists and their supporters [that] are active in planning kidnappings.\"\n\nWhile a history of war and political instability and coups d'états means that travel into Niger from Western countries remains very low (the State Department has kept it at the \"do not travel\" advisory level for years), the latest move from its government is a major escalation in relations.",

    "description": "A comedy writer anticipating Trump’s name being added to the Kennedy Center proactively bought domain names “trumpkennedycenter.org” and “trumpkennedycenter.com.”",
    "fullText": "President Trump’s handpicked board of the Kennedy Center alienated artists and angered members of the Kennedy family by slapping the 47th president’s name on the living memorial to the nation’s 35th president — but a comedy writer whose credits include “South Park” and “Mad TV” may just have the last laugh.\n\nToby Morton said he saw the writing on the wall in August and proactively purchased the domain names “trumpkennedycenter.org” and “trumpkennedycenter.com” in anticipation of Trump’s move. He said he was tipped off when Trump “began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year” and by the president’s hints that he might try to make it a monument to himself.\n\n“I thought, yep, that name’s going on the building,” Morton told the Washington Post.\n\nMorton, who describes himself on Instagram as a “Creator of Anti-Fascist Websites,” has previously purchased domain names associated with the likes of Reps. Nancy Mace and Marjorie Taylor Greene to create parody accounts. When asked if he plans to use the Trump Kennedy Center websites in a similar way, he said they’ll “absolutely reflect the absurdity of the moment.”\n\n“The Kennedy Center has always been a cultural institution meant to outlast any one administration or personality,” Morton told the Post. “It’s meant to honor culture, not ego. Once it was treated like personal branding, satire became unavoidable.”\n\nThe Kennedy Center still operates under the domain name kennedy-center.org, though the top of its homepage refers to the building as the Trump Kennedy Center. But Trump faces legal changes in actually renaming the building, which was formally dubbed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts by an Act of Congress in 1964 after JFK was assassinated.\n\nTrump’s hands-on approach to the Kennedy Center has been met with consequences.\n\nOn Wednesday, jazz drummer Chuck Redd canceled the Christmas Eve show he’s been playing there for nearly 20 years after Trump’s team literally added the current president’s name to the building’s facade. On Friday, Trump-appointed Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell fired off an angry letter to Redd, threatening to sue him for $1 million over his “abrupt cancellation.”\n\nAfter Trump took it upon himself to host the annual Kennedy Center Honors earlier this month, preliminary ratings for the event’s Tuesday broadcast on CBS reportedly showed the ceremony was viewed by “its smallest ever audience.”",

    "fullText": "CNN’s Abby Phillip caught Scott Jennings a bit off-guard on Friday’s CNN NewsNight, after the Republican strategist defended President Donald Trump’s renaming of the Kennedy Center for himself.\n\nLast week, Trump announced that the board of the Kennedy Center, which he chairs and has stocked with loyalists such as his Attorney General Pam Bondi, his Chief-of-Staff Susie Wiles, and Fox News host Laura Ingraham, had voted to rename the cultural venue to the Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, or the Trump-Kennedy Center for brevity’s sake. The day after the announcement, Trump’s name was put on the building.\n\nOn NewsNight, Phillip asked Jennings about the precedent that the renaming sets:\n\nPHILLIP: What happens when the next Democratic president just decides, you know, “We’re gonna call it the Obama-Lincoln Memorial? We’re just gonna slap, you know, Bill Clinton’s name on something, anything arbitrarily.” Are you guys gonna be cool with that?”\n\nJENNINGS: So you’re saying a Democrat would put Obama’s name on a statue that isn’t of him? That would make them look like the stupidest person that ever lived.\n\nPHILLIP: Well, I’m glad you said that, because the Kennedy Center is literally a congressionally-named memorial.\n\nPHILLIP: It’s not a statue, but it is a memorial to President John F. Kennedy in the same way that the Lincoln Memorial is a memorial to President Lincoln,” Phillip responded.\n\nJENNINGS: But it’s a statue. It has a likeness.\n\nPHILLIP: So are you ready for a Democratic president to slap their name–\n\nJENNINGS: I’m ready for Democrats to misname every statue in America. I think, to prove your point, I think that would be great for their party. Change all the names on the statues.\n\nIn 1964, Congress named the center for JFK, who was assassinated the previous year. The congressional resolution that did so said that “the living memorial to be named in his honor by this joint resolution shall be the sole national monument to his memory within the city of Washington and its environs.”\n\nThis month, Trump also announced a new class of battleships that will be named for him. The president said he will even be involved in their design because “I’m a very aesthetic person.”\n\nThe post Abby Phillip Turns the Tables After Scott Jennings Defends Trump Renaming Kennedy Center for Himself: ‘I’m Glad You Said That, Because…’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban believes the government may have slipped in a version of universal basic income without anyone realizing it. And he thinks it came through an unexpected path: Health savings accounts.\n\n“I think it’s interesting that the [Trump] administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed,” Cuban wrote in a post on X recently.\n\nI think it's interesting that the administration offered a UBI program, hidden behind direct HSA contributions, and no one noticed \n\nThose eligible for the $3k or so annual HSA contributions, can withdraw with a 20% penalty. \n\nThat's $200 per month.

If used for non-medical expenses, the funds incur a 20% penalty, but that still amounts to roughly $200 per month in available cash.\n\n“Aka UBI, for anyone under the standard deduction or even paying zero taxes because of child tax credits,” he added.\n\nCuban emphasized that this structure functions like a soft safety net for lower-income Americans, even if it’s not officially labeled as UBI. “I never thought we would see a UBI proposal. But here we are!”\n\nStill, he criticized the approach, writing, “I’m not a fan of the HSA contributions because too little will actually be spent on healthcare.”\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban’s comments sparked debate. The 2024 Libertarian presidential candidate Lars Mapstead pushed back, writing, “The government is not depositing $3,000 into accounts. Individuals or employers fund HSAs with their own money. Calling this a UBI implies new public spending, which is not happening,” he said. “The $200/month framing is misleading.”\n\nAnother person added that the HSA structure “misses the cruel design” and benefits the comfortable while excluding around 40% of Americans. “It's reverse welfare for the comfortable,” they said. Cuban replied simply, “Wrong.”\n\nSpine surgeon John Asghar also challenged the idea. “Eligibility is limited, contribution caps remain low, and access requires enrollment in a qualifying plan,” he said. “Funds must be pre-contributed and non-medical withdrawals trigger taxes plus a 20 percent penalty.”",

    "description": "Fancy fliers are creating a huge boom in private-jet travel, no longer the exclusive province of Fortune 500 companies, Donald Trump, or Taylor Swift. Yet for all the allure of flying private, it’s a rather dangerous luxury.",
    "fullText": "THEY CALLED HER Gypset. The name, a combination of gypsy and jet set, wasn’t one she’d come up with herself; she’d gotten it from the writer Julia Chaplin, who coined the term in her 2009 book, Gypset Style, to evoke the vibe of bright young things who waft from Sayulita to Tangier to Topanga Canyon, crafting eclectic necklaces and draping yurts with Hermès cashmere. Athletic and glamorously bohemian, with glacial blue eyes and a silver ring in her nose, Gypset embodied her nickname’s ideal, always flying off to go skiing or hang out backstage at a rock show.\n\nHer given name was Lindsey Gleiche. She was 31 and lived in Huntington Beach, California, a short walk to the Pacific surf. Being a gypset is an occupation best suited for the independently wealthy, and Gleiche wasn’t that; she had a normal job, designing websites for Dollar General. But she was beautiful, friendly, and free-spirited.\n\nIn mid-2022, she met a man five years her junior, Riese Lenders, on a ski trip to Mammoth. Lenders was a pilot who was building his flight experience in Cessnas, turboprops, and small jets. He took her on jaunts to Las Vegas to see shows; to Arizona for her birthday; to the Bay Area for more music.\n\nIt was an intense but short-lived relationship. The two called it quits in spring 2023, but they continued to see each other occasionally, as exes sometimes do. On a Friday night in July, Gleiche was in her apartment getting ready to have dinner by herself when her phone rang. It was Lenders. He was about to take a spur-of-the-moment flight to Las Vegas with two older couples. The relationship was personal and professional—Lenders was working for Manuel Vargas, but the two were also friends. Perhaps that’s why Lenders was allowed to ask Gleiche if she wanted to tag along—they could make a night of it, hit some bars, and then fly home. What did she think?\n\nShe said yes right away. It was a nearly two-hour drive across the mountains to get to French Valley, the airstrip Lenders was departing from—a slog, but better than sitting at home on a Friday night.\n\nThe plane, a white Cessna Citation II jet with red and tan speed stripes, took off at 9:18 p.m. from the exurbs on the far side of the coastal mountains. Lenders, the pilot in command, sat in the front-left seat. To his right was his copilot, 32-year-old Vargas. Vargas had a successful real estate and landscaping business and flew helicopters, jets, and prop planes for both business and pleasure. He and his wife, Abby, had five kids, ranging in age from 1 to 14, and lived in a sprawling compound in Temecula. Abby was sitting in the back of the plane with Gleiche and the other couple, Alma, 51, and Abe Razick, 48. The Razicks had seven kids and owned several car dealerships in California and Arizona.",

    "description": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.\n\nThe famous podcaster described Trump's actions as \"nutty\" and suggested that the president may need a trusted right-hand man to help rein in some of his more extreme tendencies.\n\nThe White House recently released a statement claiming that the president was in good health. However, concerns about Donald Trump's health were renewed following his December 18 presidential address.\n\nIn a recent episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan hosted fellow comedian Tom Segura, and together, the two discussed several decisions the president has made in recent months.\n\nDuring the conversation, Segura suggested that some of Trump's recent actions, including the renaming of the Kennedy Center after himself, indicate that the president may be \"losing it.\"\n\nRogan responded by agreeing with Segura's assessment while also suggesting that Trump's \"nutty\" behavior could be attributed to his advanced age.\n\n\"I think everybody does when you get to a certain age,\" Rogan said about Trump, who turned 79 this year, per the Daily Mail.\n\nThe podcaster went on to blast Trump's new \"wall of fame\" of past presidents, in which he trolled his predecessor on a plaque as \"Sleepy Joe Biden\" and \"by far, the worst President in American History.\"\n\n\"There's nothing nuttier than the plaques underneath the president's names,\" Rogan said of the gesture. He asked further, \"How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?\"\n\nLooking ahead, Rogan said he believes Trump needs a trusted \"right-hand man\" who would advise him and help curb his more reckless tendencies.\n\nTo further his point, Rogan said it is even more necessary given everything Trump has faced in recent years.\n\nThis includes past accusations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election to help Trump, a notion Trump has repeatedly referred to as the \"Russian hoax.\" Rogan also referenced the assassination attempt on Trump that occurred prior to his second-term election victory.\n\n\"The stress of going through what that guy went through, where they were trying to jail him when they were going after him with the Russia thing, the Russia hoax, and all that sh-t,\" said Rogan.\n\n\"Like they were trying everything they could to destroy him, just that alone has gotta break your brain, and then they took a shot at him,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the month, the White House attempted to clarify rumors about Trump's health in a statement to reporters.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shared that the president's MRI was \"perfectly normal,\" his major organs \"appear very healthy and well perfused,\" and that he \"remains in excellent overall health.\n\n\"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns,\" Leavitt said, per Politico. \"In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump's age.\"\n\nLeavitt also mentioned that the tests, which were carried out in October, were meant to determine whether the president had any issues.\n\nHowever, none were found, and the information is now being shared in a bid for transparency.\n\n\"I think that's quite a bit of detail in the effort of transparency,\" Leavitt said at the time. \"The president promised it… and we have it delivered.\"\n\nThe concerns about Trump's health were further renewed after his presidential address on Wednesday night, December 17.\n\nDuring the speech, the president took aim at his predecessor while also boasting about the success of his administration.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, the former cardiologist of the late Vice President Dick Cheney, claimed that Trump's manner of speaking during the address showed that there were some issues with his health.\n\n\"The pace of this address is manic,\" the veteran doctor wrote on X, which he followed with another tweet saying, \"I'm seriously concerned about the health of the president.\"\n\nHe later wrote, \"No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.\"\n\nNetizens also supported Dr. Reiner's concerns about Trump's health in the comment section of his post.\n\n\"His behavior has grown even more erratic. In my view, the entire world should be concerned. No one in the industry could keep their job behaving this way,\" a user remarked.\n\n\"Slurring his words, unable to read, leaning onto the podium and clutching it with his left hand so he doesn't fall,\" another netizen wrote, adding, \"Trump is not well.\"\n\nHowever, some criticized Dr. Reiner's comments, accusing him of being more critical of Trump than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\n\nA person wrote, \"It's funny how unconcerned you were with Biden's health until the country was slapped in the face with it during the debate, and your only concern was possible sleep apnea? Go away.\"",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "fullText": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

    "description": "Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell lambasted a performer’s decision to cancel an annual Christmas Eve jazz concert, following the addition of President Donald Trump’s name to the Washington, DC, arts venue.",
    "fullText": "Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell lambasted a performer’s decision to cancel an annual Christmas Eve jazz concert, following the addition of President Donald Trump’s name to the Washington, DC, arts venue.\n\nIn a letter, which the Kennedy Center shared a copy of with CNN, Grenell sharply criticizes jazz artist Chuck Redd’s actions and praises Trump for his leadership as the center’s chairman — a role the president’s handpicked board elected him to early in his second term after he ousted his predecessor.\n\n“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment—explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure—is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” Grenell, a longtime Trump confidant, wrote to Redd on letterhead bearing the new “Trump Kennedy Center” logo.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported on the letter.\n\nRedd told CNN on Wednesday that he canceled the holiday jazz concert, which he has hosted for nearly two decades, after seeing the board’s move to rename the building last week.\n\n“I’ve been performing at the Kennedy Center since the beginning of my career and I was saddened to see this name change,” Redd said.\n\nGrenell goes on to fault Redd for financial fallout relating to what he called a “political stunt” and said the center will seek $1 million in damages.\n\nCNN has reached out to Redd for comment on the letter.\n\nRoma Daravi, vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, echoed Grenell’s sentiment, arguing that Redd “failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.”\n\n“Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,” Daravi said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America’s cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.”\n\nThe cancelation of the free “Jazz Jam” show followed a vote by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts’s board of trustees to rename the cultural institution for both the Democratic former president and Trump last week.\n\nIn the hours after the vote, the center updated its website and the following day installed new signage to the facade of the building bearing Trump’s name.\n\nThe move quickly sparked outrage from Kennedy family, lawmakers and patrons of the historic center, including a lawsuit from one Democratic congresswoman challenging whether the board has the authority to rename the facility, which Congress designated in 1964 as a memorial to the 35th president.\n\nPrior to the renaming, Trump’s overhaul of the center was already raising concerns about lost revenue as both artists and audiences flee for other venues. Artists including Issa Rae, Renée Fleming, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space. And Jeffrey Seller, producer of the hit musical “Hamilton,” canceled the show’s planned run earlier this year.\n\nThis holiday season, lagging ticket sales have also impacted “The Nutcracker,” historically one of the center’s most popular events. Approximately 10,000 seats were sold for this year’s production across seven performances, compared with around 15,000 seats each in the 2021 through 2024 performances, according to internal sales data reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe Kennedy Center comped approximately five times more tickets for the performances this year than in the past four years, the data showed. And this year’s show has fallen about half a million dollars short of its $1.5 million budgeted revenue goal.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump's handpicked board approved the renaming, which scholars have said violates the law. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump’s name from the building once he leaves office, and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Imran Ahmed says US companies are ‘corrupting the system’ of politics by seeking to avoid accountability\n\nA British anti-disinformation campaigner told by the Trump administration that he faces possible removal from the US has said he is being targeted by arrogant and “sociopathic” tech companies for trying to hold them to account.\n\nImran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is among five European nationals barred from the US by the state department after being accused of seeking to push tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.\n\nAhmed lives lawfully in Washington DC with his American wife and daughter, meaning he is at risk of deportation. Late on Thursday a court granted him a temporary restraining order to block any attempt to remove him from the US or detain him.\n\nAhmed told the Guardian he believed he had been singled out for his work seeking greater accountability and transparency for social media and AI firms, which has led to Elon Musk’s X unsuccessfully suing CCDH.\n\nAhmed, who is a friend of Morgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, said it was another attempt to deflect accountability and transparency.\n\n“This has never been about politics,” he said, adding that his organisation had worked successfully with the first Trump administration and would do so again if asked.\n\n“What it has been about is companies that simply do not want to be held accountable and, because of the influence of big money in Washington, are corrupting the system and trying to bend it to their will, and their will is to be unable to be held accountable,” he said.\n\n“There is no other industry, that acts with such arrogance, indifference and a lack of humility and sociopathic greed at the expense of people.”\n\nAs well as Ahmed, the state department has barred the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accused the five people of leading “organised efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetise and suppress American viewpoints they oppose”.\n\nSarah Rogers, an official at the state department, posted on X: “Our message is clear: if you spend your career fomenting censorship of American speech, you’re unwelcome on American soil.”\n\nThe sanctions are being seen as the latest attack on European regulations that target hate speech and misinformation. Campaigners in the UK have said the British government could be targeted further if the Trump administration steps up its attacks on tech regulation.\n\nAhmed, who began his career working with Labour politicians in Westminster, said he had not yet formally received any notification from the US government, and that he believed its case against him was unfounded. “I’m very confident that our first amendment rights will be upheld by the court,” he said.\n\nThe next court hearing, due on Monday, is expected to confirm the protective order that prevents the US government from detaining him, said Ahmed, who spent Christmas away from his wife and infant daughter amid the legal battle.\n\nHe said this was “a rational thing for us to do, given that in every other case to date where someone has had a green card withdrawn in the last few months, they have been arrested and detained and often spirited hundreds or thousands of miles away from their friends, family and support networks.”\n\nThe CCDH has previously angered Musk over reports chronicling the rise of racist, antisemitic and extremist content on X since he took it over. Musk tried unsuccessfully to sue the CCDH last year before calling it a “criminal organisation”.\n\nMore recently, the CCDH released a report warning about harmful answers produced by the latest version of ChatGPT when asked about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.\n\n“We’ve seen that social media and AI companies are increasingly under pressure as a result of organisations like mine,” Ahmed said. “No one likes being exposed as mendacious or hypocritical, but they call their friends in government or they call their pitbull litigation lawyers and start suing.”\n\nAhmed said it was particularly jarring to be targeted given that hate speech and misinformation was increasingly a bipartisan issue, raised as a concern by some Republican politicians as well as Democrats.\n\nHe said he was nonetheless ready to respond with a swift legal response when he heard the news. “When you take on the world’s biggest corporations and when you’ve had the experiences we’ve had, being sued by the world’s richest man, you dissociate and compartmentalise immediately.”\n\nThere had been a cost already, he said. “Nothing I’m going through compares to any of the parents I sit with who’ve lost their children,” Ahmed said. “I chose to take on the biggest companies in the world, to hold them accountable, to speak truth to power. There is a cost attached to that. My family understands that.\n\n“The only time I felt any sadness at all is last night when my wife told me that our child said her sixth word, and then I cried a bit.”\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "fullText": "A prescient writer for the irreverent Comedy Central show South Park correctly predicted that President Donald Trump would slap his name on the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, so he bought up Trump-Kennedy Center web domains to troll the president.\n\nWriter Toby Morton bought the “trumpkennedycenter.org” and “trumpkennedycenter.com” domains back in August and is now plotting how best to parody Trump’s vanity, according to The Washington Post.\n\n“As soon as Trump began gutting the Kennedy Center board earlier this year, I thought, ‘Yep, that name’s going on the building,’” Morton told The Post.\n\nMorton said that when a politician starts “blowing up in the news,” he snags the relevant domain name and begins building a parody site as a form of “political activism.”\n\nMorton also owns NancyMace26.com, MTG2026.org, and ResignChuck.com, targeting Democratic Senate Minority Leader Rep. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\nMorton said there’s one domain opportunity that got away from him that he’ll “forever regret”: A domain having to do with CNN’s Jake Tapper before the release of the book he co-wrote, Original Sin, about former president Joe Biden’s decline.\n\nMorton hasn’t revealed what he plans to do with the Trump-Kennedy Center domains, but he told WaPo “it’ll absolutely reflect the absurdity of the moment. Lots of surprises. Some things are truly hard to parody, though.”\n\nHe added: “The Kennedy Center has always been a cultural institution meant to outlast any one administration or personality. It’s meant to honor culture, not ego. Once it was treated like personal branding, satire became unavoidable.”\n\nSouth Park went hard at the Trump administration during the president’s second term, even portraying the president having a baby with Satan.\n\nIn a synopsis of the season finale written by Mediaite’s Zachary Leeman, “Satan was finally ready to give birth to his and Trump’s baby while the president was scheming, along with Vice President JD Vance — with whom he’s also having an affair on the show — to get Peter Thiel out of jail so he can help kill the antichrist baby.”\n\nThe post South Park Writer Saw Trump’s Kennedy Center Name-Change Coming, So He Bought Multiple Web Domains to Troll Him first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump has overturned decades of U.S. trade policy — building a wall of tariffs around what used to be a wide open economy.\n\nHis double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country have disrupted global commerce and strained the budgets of consumers and businesses worldwide. They have also raised tens of billions of dollars for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nTrump has argued that his steep new import taxes are necessary to bring back wealth that was “stolen” from the U.S. He says they will narrow America's decades-old trade deficit and bring manufacturing back to the country. But upending the global supply chain has proven costly for households facing rising prices. The taxes are paid by importers who typically attempt to pass along the higher costs to their customers. That includes businesses and ultimately, U.S. households.\n\nAnd the erratic way the president rolled out his tariffs — announcing them, then suspending or altering them before conjuring up new ones — made 2025 one of the most turbulent economic years in recent memory.\n\nHere's a look at the impact of Trump's tariffs over the last year, in four charts.\n\nA key number for the overall impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers and businesses is the “effective” tariff rate — which, unlike headline figures imposed by Trump for specific trade actions, provides an average based on the actual imports coming into the country.\n\nIn 2025, per data from the Yale Budget Lab, the effective U.S. tariff rate peaked in April. But it's still far higher than the average seen at the start of the year. Before finalizing shifts in consumption, November's effective tariff rate was nearly 17% — seven times greater than January's average and the highest seen since 1935.\n\nTariff revenue vs America's trade deficit\n\nAmong selling points to justify his tariffs, Trump has repeatedly said they would reduce America's longstanding trade deficit and bring revenue into the Treasury.\n\nTrump's higher tariffs are certainly raising money. They've raked in more than $236 billion this year through November — much more than in years past. But they still account for just a fraction of the federal government's total revenue. And they haven't raised nearly enough to justify the president's claim that tariff revenue could replace federal income taxes — or allow for windfall dividend checks for Americans.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit, meanwhile, has fallen significantly since the start of the year. The trade gap peaked to a monthly record of $136.4 billion in March, as consumers and businesses hurried to import foreign products before Trump could impose his tariffs on them. The trade gap narrowed to $52.8 billion in September, the latest month for which data is available. But the year-to-date deficit was still running 17% ahead of January-September 2024.",

Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.\"\n\nTrump continued, railing on Democrats, the New York Times and bringing up Russian interference into the 2016 U.S. presidential election, calling it \"FAKE.\" He wrote, \"Now the same losers are at it again, only this time so many of their friends, mostly innocent, will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished. But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe president's holiday message comes days after the latest batch of files released in the Epstein case included an unverified rape allegation against Trump. A document dated Oct. 27, 2020 appears to be an FBI intake report that features the account of a former limo driver. Though most names are redacted, the text details an alleged 1999 visit between the driver, his son and an unnamed woman. The driver claimed he met Trump years earlier in 1995, when he said he drove the real estate mogul to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nThe document reads, \"[Driver] reported some of the things President Trump had spoken about during the ride while on his cell phone were very concerning.\" It says, \"[Driver] noted Trump continuously stated the name 'Jeffrey' while on the phone, and made references to 'abusing some girl.' [Driver] was unsure who he was talking to nor who he was referencing.\"\n\nAccording to the report, the driver alleged that as he was recalling the story about Trump's phone call, the unnamed woman he was with went \"stone cold.\" Describing the driver’s unverified allegations, the document reads, \"[Woman] stated, 'He raped me.' [Driver] said, 'What?' as [Woman] replied 'Donald J. Trump had raped her along with Jeffrey Epstein.' \"\n\nThe Department of Justice took proactive measures against the claims while releasing the documents, saying in a Tuesday, Dec. 23, statement on social media that the pages contained \"untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"\n\nThe document releases are all part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed in November to compel the Justice Department to release the files related to the Epstein investigations, though with significant exceptions and redactions. Trump, who had a documented relationship with Epstein and featured in several photos in the already-released files, had previously opposed the legislation.\n\nThe president spent much of the holiday week focused on his own victories and failures, using Christmas Eve calls with children to brag about winning the state of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOn Dec. 24, the president participated in NORAD Santa Claus calls, accepting calls from children across the nation. When a child from Pennsylvania called, Trump told him his home state was \"great.\" “We won Pennsylvania — actually, three times,” the president continued. “We won it in a landslide. So I love Pennsylvania.”",

Now the same losers are at it again, only this time so many of their friends, mostly innocent, will be badly hurt and reputationally tarnished. But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!!\n\nHe concluded, “Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas! President Donald J.

What we do have is a Record Stock Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected.”\n\nHe also attacked late-night host Stephen Colbert in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, calling him a “dead man walking” and urging CBS to “put him to sleep.”\n\nThe post Trump Sends Cryptic Message to Democrats: ‘Enjoy What May Be Your Last Merry Christmas!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has shared a bizarre Christmas day social media post about Jeffrey Epstein, saying that he dropped ties with the late sex offender “long before it became fashionable,” and that the controversy surrounding the release of the so-called Epstein files is a “Radical Left Witch Hunt.”\n\nThe Trump administration has been facing ongoing scrutiny, mainly from Democrats but also some Republicans, for its handling of government files related to Epstein as the public pushes for more transparency about the disgraced financiers’ life and crimes.\n\n“Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein...only to ‘drop him like a dog’ when things got too HOT, falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J. Trump, who was actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Thursday evening.\n\nThe president was friends with Epstein decades ago, calling him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 New York magazine profile. In the midst of the Epstein controversy, The Wall Street Journal reported on a lewd birthday card Trump supposedly gave Epstein in 2003, but the president has denied that he authored such a letter.\n\nBut Trump has said their relationship ended before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution. The White House has said Trump did “nothing wrong” and that the president kicked Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for being a “creep.”\n\nTrump suggested in Wednesday’s Truth Social post that these people who thought Epstein was “the greatest guy on earth” were all Democrats.\n\n“When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt...and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do...Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!” Trump wrote.\n\nWhen the Justice Department started to release its trove of Epstein documents last Friday — thanks to Congress pushing through legislation to force the Trump administration to reveal all the information it had on the convicted sex offender — photos of former Democratic President Bill Clinton emerged.\n\nIn one photo, Clinton and Epstein were smiling as they stood next to each other wearing silky shirts. In another, Clinton was swimming in a pool with Epstein’s longtime associate and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump might be president, but even he has to endure holiday dinners with his in-laws.\n\nTrump, 79, spent Christmas Eve at his Mar-a-Lago estate alongside family members including First Lady Melania Trump, 55, and her father, Viktor Knavs—who is just two years the president’s senior.\n\nThe trio was seated together at an extravagant Christmas Eve dinner Wednesday night at the Palm Beach resort, which Forbes valued at $325 million in 2023. In video footage circulating online from the event, Knavs, 81, appears animated as he chats with his daughter, who leans in closely to hear him.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, stares straight ahead, seemingly frozen out of the conversation. He sits glumly scanning the room before he notices the camera is on him, prompting a stiff, performative fist shake.\n\nCritics of the president were quick to seize on the moment online, pointing to what they described as Melania’s lack of interest. “Could she sit any farther away?” one X user quipped. “Trump seethes with rage & embarrassment that Melania only wants to talk to her dad,” another wrote in a post viewed 1.6 million times.\n\nKnavs and his late wife, Amalija, both worked in fashion and sales in Slovenia before relocating to the United States after their daughter married the real estate scion. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2018, despite their son-in-law’s hardline stance on immigration.\n\nA fixture of the president’s family life, Knavs has appeared at events ranging from Trump’s inauguration to his Thanksgiving dinner table. When Barron Trump—the president’s youngest son and the only child he shares with the first lady—graduated from the prestigious Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, in May 2024, Knavs was the only family member in attendance besides Barron’s parents, the Palm Beach Post reported.\n\nMelania Trump and Barron Trump are both known to have close relationships with the Slovenian businessman. Melania Trump was largely absent from the now-president’s third and final campaign as she cared for her mother, Amalija Knavs, who died Jan. 9, 2024, and was laid to rest in Palm Beach, according to reports.\n\nBarron Trump remained close to his grandfather throughout the funeral, according to reports.\n\nIn 2016, Melania Trump’s childhood friends told The New York Times that they remembered Knavs—who was a member of the elite Communist Party in what was then Yugoslavia—as a “larger-than-life personality” much like Trump himself.\n\nAt the time, Trump’s campaign denied that Melania Trump’s father was ever an “active member” of the party.\n\n“But he was pretty successful over there,” Trump said in a 2016 interview. “It’s a different kind of success than you have here. But he was successful.”\n\nTrump may have appeared fatigued at dinner after a jam-packed afternoon, during which he took calls from children across the United States as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command’s Santa tracker.\n\nIn true Trump fashion, the decades-old presidential tradition took a political turn.\n\n“Pennsylvania is great. We won Pennsylvania, actually three times, but we won Pennsylvania. We won it in a landslide. So I love Pennsylvania,” Trump enthusiastically told a 5-year-old from the Keystone State—who was not yet alive during his first two presidential campaigns.\n\nThe president later capped off Christmas Eve with a scathing post on Truth Social, decrying what he called the “Radical Left Scum.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump are spending Christmas at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nIn between rounds of golf at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, the president announced a new \"Trump-class\" of ships, called service members to wish them a merry Christmas, and spoke to children while tracking Santa Claus' journey from the North Pole.\n\nHe also commented on the Jeffrey Epstein files for the first time since the Justice Department released images and documents on December 19 as part of the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nThe Christmas holiday marks Trump's 16th visit to Mar-a-Lago in 2025. He is expected to remain in Palm Beach through January 4.\n\nTake a look at Mar-a-Lago's lavish Christmas celebrations.\n\nThe president flew to Palm Beach on Air Force One after holding a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. First lady Melania Trump did not appear to be traveling with him.\n\nThe golf club is located around 4.5 miles from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nJoined by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of the Navy John Phelan, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that the \"Trump-class\" would eventually include 20 to 25 ships.\n\nPhelan said the first of these ships to be built will be the USS Defiant, an 880-foot-long, heavily armed battleship with a crew of 850. Some of its planned weaponry is still in development, such as the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear, or SLCM-N.\n\nAt the press conference, Trump also addressed the Epstein files for the first time since they were officially released on December 19.\n\nTrump acknowledged that he appeared in photos released by the Justice Department, saying that Epstein \"was all over Palm Beach and other places.\"\n\n\"What this whole thing is with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,\" he said.\n\nDonald Trump rode through Palm Beach in \"The Beast,\" the armored presidential limousine.\n\nTrump thanked service members for their \"extraordinary devotion and service to America\" and touted his $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" bonus checks sent to military members ahead of Christmas.\n\nTrump moved gold angel statues from the ceiling of Mar-a-Lago's Grand Ballroom to the doorways in the Oval Office, which he has redecorated to more closely resemble the gold-covered walls of his Palm Beach estate.\n\nThat night, Trump shared a holiday message on Truth Social.\n\n\"Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled. The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, says that he called off the performance in the wake of the White House announcing last week that President Donald Trump's name would be added to the facility.\n\nAs of last Friday, the building's facade reads The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision, which scholars have said violates the law. Trump had been suggesting for months he was open to changing the center's name.\n\n“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday “Jazz Jams” at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William “Keter” Betts.\n\nThe Kennedy Center did not immediately respond to email seeking comment. The center's website lists the show as canceled.\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump's name from the building once he leaves office and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it, and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators. The changes at the Kennedy Center are part of the president's larger mission to fight “woke” culture at federal cultural institutions.\n\nNumerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of “Hamilton.”",

    "description": "The United States has slapped a fresh set of tariffs on Chinese electronic components, but their implementation has been delayed until 2027.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nThe U.S. has made its latest move in the global trade war. Based on the results of a new report, the Trump administration has announced a new round of tariffs on Chinese semiconductor products, though they won't take effect just yet. The de facto for the new tariff is June 23, 2027. The delayed implementation may be thanks to a recent and mild easing of tensions between the U.S. and China, as the Chinese government has itself recently delayed export restrictions on rare-earths products into next year.\n\nAt a technical level, per the U.S. Trade Representative notice, the tariffs are already in in place at a 0% rate, a figure that will increase in 18 months on June 23, 2027. The new rate will be known no later than 30 days before that date. Crucially, the new tariffs would be applied on top of the already-existing 50% tax on Chinese semiconductor imports that came into effect January 1 this year.\n\nIt's worth noting that while there's some overlap in the late, the tariff codes in the latest sanctions include section 8541 items including diodes, transistors, amplifiers, and optic couplers, but do not include the 8542 section covered by the January 1st tariffs, meaning that different components would have different tariff rates, and some would get hit with a double-strike.\n\nThe new tariffs are the result of a year-long survey launched by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), which itself was part of an investigation into China's semiconductor production chain originally launched during the Biden administration. The resulting report has been made public and paints an interesting picture. This part of the investigation focused on \"legacy\" chips (usually 22nm and larger) and other components like op-amps, analog chips, and diodes — all components that are material to building most any electronic device.\n\nThe BIS compares the current over-reliance on Chinese semiconductors to the situation that took place during the COVID pandemic, where it became painfully obvious that far too many products relied on components that had a limited number of centralized sources. In this instance, the BIS found that \"across all respondents’ products, 66 percent (by revenue) contained or likely contained at least one chip manufactured by PRC-based foundries,\" with many respondents to even being able to pinpoint the source of those chips, or when they did, if they originated in the PRC.\n\nThe report claims that the situation is the results of \"non-market overcapacity and economic coercion.\" According to HoganLovells, the findings \"[point] to China’s industrial policy frameworks, including the Made in China 2025 initiative, which reportedly establishes specific numerical targets for domestic semiconductor production and capacity.\"",

    "fullText": "Peter Thiel has been described variously as ‘America’s leading public intellectual’, the ‘architect of Silicon Valley’s contemporary ethos’ or as an ‘incoherent and alarmingly super-nationalistic’ malevolent force. The PayPal and Palantir founder, a prominent early supporter of Donald Trump, is one of the world’s richest and most influential men. Throughout his career, his principal concern has always been the future, so when The Spectator asked to interview him, he wanted to talk to young people. To that effect, three young members of the editorial team were sent to Los Angeles to meet him. What follows is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nWILLIAM ATKINSON: Following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York, an email that you sent five years ago has gone viral. You argued that with accumulating student debt and housing costs, it was no surprise that young people were turning to socialism. How do you explain that there are Gen Zs, like us, who aren’t on the left?\n\n‘The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing. America is no longer a great country’\n\nPETER THIEL: My sense is that in the US, Britain, Germany and France, the Gen Z voters are less centrist. I wouldn’t say they’re more drawn to the extremes, but they do not believe there are solutions within the Overton window straitjacket, the narrow space that’s been defined between New Labour and the Tories [in the UK] for the past three decades. And then there’s Reform, a party that repudiates that spectrum. For the first time in 200 years, there’s a real party to the right of the Tories. It’s not just a Gen Z phenomenon, but there’s a Gen Z part that is very important.\n\nWE: You first argued in the late 2000s that the backlash from globalisation would upend politics. Do you often feel that the world is catching up with Peter Thiel?\n\nPT: These things were coming for a long time. Student debt was $300 billion in 2000, around $2 trillion today. The GFC [global financial crisis] in 2008 was a big watershed. Entry-level jobs became less well paid. For students graduating after 2008, it became much, much harder to get out of the debt. Student debt slows you down from buying a house, getting started with forming a family, becoming an actual adult. You end up with a completely different society. It takes a long time to figure this out. But I started talking about this a lot in 2010… Why did house prices go up so much faster than incomes? Not enough was built. A big part was built as a retirement vehicle for older people. They were happy with the prices going up. The Tory party in the UK is probably completely past the point of no return. The suggestion that I have had was that you must start by throwing everybody out of the party who comes from real estate. You must be willing to purge all the people that are part of this dysfunctional system.\n\nJOHN POWER: What would your advice be to someone in their twenties about how they can have an impact in politics? Should they join Reform?\n\nPT: I think about politics a fair bit, but if I spent all my life on it, I would go out of my mind. I would like people to be more involved in right-wing politics, but I’m not sure that’s the best thing for most. You certainly should work for Reform rather than Labour or the Tories. You can criticise Nigel Farage as too much of a Boomer but he’s less structurally hateful to the young people. But maybe this is not the right way to frame the questions. We’re gonna have a revolution from Gen Z – all these crazy things that they are going to be doing. Is this good or bad? I’ve often said, in the early 20th century you think of both communism and fascism as youth movements that went very, very haywire. In the early 21st century, the reality is we have inverted demographic pyramids. There are not enough young people. We’re not going to get youthful communism or youthful fascism. We have this unbelievably oppressive, powerful gerontocracy. Maybe you can get communism or fascism of old people, but it’s very low-energy. It will avoid some of the defects of the early 20th century.But it’ll have many other kinds of problems. The general challenge for Gen Z is that there are big constraints.\n\nMy hope is that there always are some technological fixes, defining technology as doing more with less. If the debate is more with more spending or less with less spending, you end up with runaway deficits or extremely cruel rationing. I have critiques of the three biggest European countries – Germany, France and Britain. France is way too socialist. That doesn’t work. Germany is just insane. People have got caught up in crazed ideological fixations. There’s almost nothing like the Green party anywhere outside of Germany. Britain is neither too insane nor too socialist, but it’s extremely unpragmatic. It is extraordinary how lacking in common sense it is. The optimistic case for the UK is that there are extraordinary efficiencies one could wring out of the state. It has the greatest room for improvement of any European country. But why haven’t these things been done in the past 60 or 70 years?… Maybe the entire population is just too docile.\n\nLARA BROWN: You’ve talked before about Europe’s choice between ‘Greta on a bicycle’ environmentalism, Chinese surveillance and radical Islam. Would you say Europe has chosen one path?\n\nPT: The bad doors for Europe, the three doors of the future. For the future to have power as a cultural or political idea, you want it to be different. You can’t stay in this Groundhog Day, this Tory/Labour thing where we’re never doing anything new. The problem is the three actual pictures of the future. Behind door number one is Islamic sharia law. Behind door number two is the totalitarian CCP surveillance state, a hi-tech dystopia. Behind door number three is Greta with a bicycle, and then there’s no fourth door. This is why Greta’s been winning.\n\nJP: A lot of people on the American right talk incessantly about how terrible Britain and Europe are in general. But I think there’s selective blindness and chauvinism from some people on the American right about the condition of their own country. There is nowhere in Europe as bad as Skid Row in Los Angeles. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I would defend the Trump version of the Republican party vs the zombie Reagan-Bush era. I don’t think President Trump or J.D. Vance are absurdly optimistic or panglossian about things. Make America Great Again was the most pessimistic slogan any president had in a century, and certainly that any Republican president ever had. The Trump administration is trying to pull off an extremely difficult thing, because the red pill is that America is no longer a great country. But you have to make sure it doesn’t become a gateway drug to a black pill, where you become nihilistic and give up and you’re destined to eat too many doughnuts in a trailer park. I don’t think that the right are overly optimistic in America. I don’t think there’s a problem where people describe things as even worse in other places. People in the US don’t pay attention to the world at all. We are a semi-autistic country. Maybe not quite as autistic as China, but we do not think about anything going on outside this country that much.\n\nLB: You mentioned the UK has undergone 70 years of stagnation. Many on the British right would agree, but may think that the period from 1979 to 1990 under Margaret Thatcher offered a respite from decline – she pursued unpopular but necessary policies such as anti-inflationary measures despite employment implications and her approach to the Unions. Would you question this narrative?\n\nPT: Reagan was very formative for me. I was in eighth grade in 1980 when Reagan got elected and felt at the time he was an incredibly great president and had solved all these problems once and for all. I think if I lived in the UK under Thatcher, I would have felt similarly. But they weren’t durable. We got Clinton and Blair after. The size of government didn’t shrink that much. The government sectors didn’t get weakened.\n\n‘Capitalism didn’t increase inequality but globalisation did’\n\nThere’s been a slowdown in tech since the 1970s. There was progress in the world of computers, internet, mobile, crypto, maybe now AI, but in a lot of other areas there was a much slower kind of progress. The question is, why did we not notice this faster? I think it’s because Reagan and Thatcher created a big lift. They made societies more capitalist by lowering marginal tax rates and deregulating. Lots of people got fired but the economy grew so most people ended up better off.\n\nReagan and Thatcher were exactly right for their time. But it wouldn’t work for all time. And to the extent that this distracts us from these science and technology questions, then it was somewhat problematic.\n\nThen there was the Clinton-Blair one-time fix, which was that you could somehow grow the economy and increase productivity through globalisation. That also probably gave you a big one-time lift. It came with very big long-term problems. It led to far more inequality. The Gini coefficient in the US went up more under Clinton than any other president post-1945. So capitalism did not increase inequality, but globalisation did.\n\nMy telling of the 50-year economic history is that we tried more capitalism with Reagan and Thatcher and it was the right thing to do. More globalism with Clinton and Blair was sort of the right thing to do, though it had more negative externalities that people were very dishonest about. We now need to do something very different.\n\nLB: Helen Andrews recently posited that feminism and gender-balance initiatives in the early Noughties led to a ‘Great Feminisation’. She claims this caused the prioritisation of safety over risk, a workplace culture dominated by consensus and appeals to emotion rather than logic in decision–making. How much do you buy into this as a theory of stagnation?\n\nPT: I think it’s very courageous of her to tackle something that is relatively taboo… Yes, I think there was a shift towards a risk-averse society. Feminisation was part of that. Things also went wrong with educational institutions or too much regulation. The deeper cause is that there was something dangerous and scary about where a lot of science and technology had gone.\n\nLB: Are you saying that diversity and inclusion efforts were an attempt to derail technological progress?\n\nPT: I think at some point people got very scared of where this stuff was going. Absolutely. It wasn’t just the nuclear thing. I would say that environmentalism as a movement was very focused on the dangers of limitless progress, even though in theory, you could have a lot of forms of environmentalism that would be pro-tech, right? If you’re concerned about climate change, we could build lots of new nuclear reactors that don’t emit carbon. But if we’re worried that nuclear reactors could be dual use and used to make nuclear weapons then you can’t do that. In some sense the energy shifted into this very anti-tech, anti-science direction for the past 50 years or so.\n\nLB: And you think DEI was a good way to achieve anti-tech goals?\n\n‘We’re going to end up with this really lame world where nothing happens but it’s maybe harder to blow up’\n\nPT: It’s always hard to know how intentional these things were. Diversity can function in an anti-tech way. If diversity really means homogenisation, let’s apply that to scientists. There’s no heterodoxy allowed, no heterodoxy on climate science, no heterodoxy on evolution, no heterodoxy on vaccines, on masks, on the origin of Covid. Everyone looks different but has to think alike. So diversity means conformity. And conformity is not compatible with science. And if diversity is a shibboleth, which I think is its important meaning, then we’re worshipping this god called diversity. It’s an unknown god. It’s a hypnotic magic trick that redirects our attention. And so we don’t care about science any more.\n\nJP: You seem to have a wider picture of American history, particularly in regard to wokeness. Many MAGA-adjacent people seem to think wokeness, or ‘cultural Marxism’, came from nowhere in the early 2010s, while you have identified before that it is a postwar phenomenon.\n\nPT: The culture wars are important. And there are ways in which there’s a side that’s right and there’s a side that’s wrong. But the big problem is that’s distracting us from things like housing or the economy generally, or science and tech or maybe even the CCP takeover of the world. This is where I push back against using the term ‘cultural Marxism’. I always think Marxism was at least about the economy. The focus on identity politics, multiculturalism, affirmative action, starts in the 1970s. That’s when inequality starts to go up. These things were at least correlated with us getting distracted from what I consider to be more important problems.\n\nJP: There are parts of the American right who now look at the changes of the 1960s, such the Civil Rights Act, and think it’s time to re-evaluate the postwar social consensus. What do you make of that?\n\nPT: I don’t think you can ever strictly go back. There are three questions about the history going back to the Helen Andrews piece or my stagnation thesis. First, there’s a question of what happened. Second is a question of why it happened. Then there is a very different question of what should be done now. That’s in some ways very different from the first two. Even if we can agree there’s been stagnation, even if we say the society became too feminised or too risk-averse, we don’t want to just get blackpilled from that. And then the question is: where are the places that you have some agency to get out of this straitjacket?\n\nWA: Are you optimistic that that’s happening? And do you think you’ve contributed towards it?\n\nPT: Somewhat, and very much yes.\n\nLB: Earlier you alluded to three doors we can go through: radical environmentalism, sharia law, or Chinese-style authoritarianism. If none of us wants to go through them then what’s the way out?\n\nPT: It’s a challenge on a political level because when you’re trying to win elections it ends up being about broader narratives. For people in Silicon Valley, in a way it’s more local. You can build a company and solve particular problems in that context. Silicon Valley turned out to be a big place where there was a moderate amount of freedom of action in the past few decades, although it wasn’t a panacea. There’s a part of me that thinks that for some problems you have to go through politics. If we’re going to come up with new cures and new types of nuclear power you have to somewhat deregulate the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and the NRC [Nuclear Regulatory Commission]. Some of these things are entangled with politics. But a lot of progress has happened that is decoupled from politics. One of the things that’s still healthy about the United States, unlike Britain and France, is that the political capital, the financial capital, the technological capital are all in different places, so it is very decentred. There are places where these things overlap, but there’s some way where people are able to do things that are independent.\n\nJP: Is tech going to come to the rescue like the Eagles [in Lord of the Rings], deus ex machina, providing abundance that can kind of smooth over some of the economic challenges? And as a rejoinder to that, do you think the AI bubble is about to pop?\n\nPT: There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution. It seems to be very concentrated on bigger companies, so it’s possible a lot of the returns are captured by a few companies, possibly leading to very uneven growth. While it may be a complement to human labour, it is probably more of a substitute than a complement. It will have a zero sum feel to a lot of people. At the same time if there is no other vector of growth in our society, we would be out of our minds not to take it. I don’t think it’s big enough to solve the budget deficit, but if the US embraces AI and Europe rejects it, I think the US is in somewhat better shape than Europe is.\n\n‘There are all sorts of things that I don’t particularly like about the AI revolution’\n\nOn the question of whether or not it is a bubble, I get asked this a lot by Europeans and that is how you know that they’re not going to build a lot of AI in Europe. If it’s a bubble, then people are spending too much money on AI, and they’re building too many data centres and buying too many chips, and you’re eventually going to get seriously diminishing returns on that. During the 1990s bubble, it was mainly the telecom fibre-optic infrastructure stuff where people really spent way too much and that had to get dialled back. But maybe it’s the other way around where there are high returns to AI, enabling the automation of certain workflows and enhanced productivity.\n\nIf the AI bubble does not burst, it’s possible that it ends up being quite inflationary because you have to use more power for these data centres. The atoms part of our economy is regulated and it’s hard to ramp up the power. But if the returns on power going to AI chips are really high, it will absorb a lot of energy. Interest rates could be higher because there’s more demand for capital. My macroeconomic placeholder is that it’s going to keep going.\n\nI’ve been allergic to AI for a long time because it can be a horrible buzzword. There was a 2016 report during the Obama administration on AI by the National Science and Technology council. If you did a search and replace, and replaced every use of the word AI with computers, it would have read the same way.\n\nAI also meant all these really different things over time. In 2014, [Nick] Bostrom defined it as machines being way smarter than humans. Kai-fu Lee wrote the CCP counterpoint AI Superpowers in 2017, where he defined it as this sort of low-tech, big data machine learning. Then in 2022 it turns out the AI revolution is LLMs [large language models] which can pass the Turing test. People had thought this would be what AI was for 70 years. So in the decade before we were about to pass the Turing test we had forgotten about it.\n\nThe dynamic when one has to think through a lot \n\nIf you look at the ratio of how many businesses there are per 100,000 people: what part of the US has the lowest number of businesses? Silicon Valley. That’s because the costs of business are higher, so these subscale businesses that are too small to go anywhere are even harder to get started. In a third-world country where there are no good businesses and everyone is an umbrella salesman, they are very entrepreneurial, but not in a scalable way. So you need to differentiate entrepreneurship from scalable businesses.\n\n‘If you’re too focused on history, you don’t pay enough attention to the future’\n\nThere’s this economist called Thomas Gür who has researched the idea that immigrants are more entrepreneurial. While that is correct, you have to adjust for the quality of the businesses and the immigrants start businesses by starting a taco truck because there’s nothing else you can do. It’s better than going on welfare. But that’s what you do when you’re not really part of a society. It’s better than nothing, but what you really want to do is scale.\n\nJP: Is there a cutting-edge domain that you would focus your energies on?\n\nPT: One of the lines we had in Zero to One [Thiel’s 2014 book about startups co-written with Blake Masters] is from Anna Karenina. It’s the opening line: ‘Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ The opposite is true of business. All failed businesses are more or less alike because they fail to escape from this problem of homogeneous competition. They didn’t do anything special. All successful businesses are special in their own way. That’s the closest I can give you to a formula and it’s incredibly hard to figure out what that is, or how to do it. I have some feel for it, I know it when I see it.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the past. That’s because it’s important. It’s how we got here. It’s what shaped a lot of these debates. At the same time, there’s also some limit to history. If you’re too focused on it, you don’t pay enough attention to the future. The point is not just to reflect on the past.\n\nThere was a medieval play on the Antichrist from 1160 or so, Ludus de Antichristo. It’s not a very good literary production, but there are these three kings, the Antichrist conquerors who focus on things like nationalism or their countries or their history. They lose because they’re too fixated on the past whilst the Antichrist is thinking about the future, and about what can be done. They don’t see Antichrist coming. So while it’s very important for those on the right to think about the past, to think about the history and what happened – they still should not lose sight of the future.",

    "description": "The Trump administration's final rule on limiting eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is set to go into effect in July 2026.",
    "fullText": "Big changes are coming for a long-standing student-loan forgiveness program.\n\nIn 2007, Congress approved the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is designed to forgive student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of making qualifying payments. It meant that student-loan borrowers who dedicate at least a decade of their careers to public service work could count on their balances eventually being wiped out.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is changing the popular program, in which about 7 million borrowers are enrolled. At the end of October, the Department of Education finalized its rule to narrow eligibility for PSLF in response to Trump's March executive order directing the education secretary to redefine what \"public service\" means.\n\nA fact sheet from the department said that the rule will change the definition of a qualifying employer \"to exclude employers that participate in illegal activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose.\"\n\nThe final rule is set to go into effect in July 2026, and some student-loan servicers that collect payments from borrowers in PSLF have said that nothing is changing yet, and borrowers will receive updates as the regulations go into effect.\n\n\"For now, there are no impacts to borrowers, payment counts, or discharges,\" one servicer, Aidvantage, posted on its website.\n\nThe Department of Education said that the changes are intended to ensure that borrowers who receive PSLF have employers that contribute to public service and do not violate any laws. However, borrowers and advocates have expressed concerns that the changes to eligibility will block public servants from relief because their employers do not align with the administration's political views.\n\n\"With this new rule, the Trump Administration is refocusing the PSLF program to ensure federal benefits go to our Nation's teachers, first responders, and civil servants who tirelessly serve their communities,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nThe key change in the PSLF rule concerns eligibility for PSLF employers. While any public service employer previously qualified for the program, a fact sheet from the Department of Education said that it will be changing the definition of a \"qualifying employer\" to exclude employers that have participated in \"substantial illegal activity,\" which the department said includes actions supporting terrorism or gender affirming care.\n\nIf the department determines that an employer engaged in illegal activity, affected employers will be notified and receive an opportunity to rebut the department's findings. Borrowers will also be notified, but they cannot appeal the findings themselves.\n\nShould the employer be disqualified from PSLF, they can reapply to be a qualifying employer within 10 years, or they can enter a \"corrective action plan\" with terms agreed upon by the department. Once an employer is deemed ineligible, any payments borrowers make while under that employer will not count toward PSLF, but retroactive payments would continue to be valid.\n\nStudent-loan borrowers in public service raised concerns with the looming PSLF changes. Megan Flocken, a nonprofit worker, told Business Insider: \"I'm counting my lucky stars that there's still the possibility that this PSLF program will remain intact because I have dedicated my whole professional life to public service.\"\n\nShortly after the department released its final rule, a coalition of advocates and nonprofits sued the administration, accusing it of violating the law and harming government and nonprofit recruitment. Some Democratic lawmakers also called for the rule to be rescinded; Sen. Bernie Sanders wrote on X on November 1 that the administration does \"not have the right to take away student debt forgiveness from teachers, nurses, veterans and other public servants if they do not show loyalty to your right-wing political agenda.\"",

    "fullText": "DENVER (AP) — Former Colorado elections clerk Tina Peters is asking the state appeals court to recognize President Donald Trump's pardon of her state convictions as valid.\n\nIn a motion Tuesday, Peters' lawyers said the Colorado appeals court no longer has jurisdiction over her case because of a Dec. 5 pardon issued by Trump. They also asked the court to release her from prison because of the pardon.\n\nPeters, the former Mesa County, Colorado clerk, was convicted of state crimes there for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race. Trump’s pardon power does not extend to state crimes.\n\nIn the court filing, Peters' lawyers argued that President George Washington issued pardons to people convicted of both state and federal crimes in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1795. They urged the state appeals court to issue a ruling quickly. The court is set to hear arguments from lawyers in Peters' appeal of her conviction on Jan. 14.\n\nThe appeals court ruled Wednesday that lawyers from the state attorney general's office, which is defending the conviction, could respond to Peters’ arguments by Jan. 8.\n\nThe office of Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser declined to comment. Weiser previously dismissed it when Trump announced it Dec. 11.\n\n“The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up,” he said in statement then.\n\nIf the appeals court rules the pardon isn't valid, one of Peters' attorneys, Peter Ticktin, said she could appeal that issue to the U.S. Supreme Court while the state court continues to consider Peters' appeal of her conviction.\n\nAnother Peters attorney, John Case, has asked the state prison system to release Peters based on Trump's pardon but the state refused, according to an email included in the appeals court filing.\n\nEarlier this month, Peters lost a bid in federal court to be released from prison while her state appeal is considered.\n\nPeters claims that the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her for making allegations about election fraud.\n\nDuring Peters’ October 2024 sentencing, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a “charlatan” and said she posed a danger to the community for spreading lies about voting and undermining the democratic process.\n\nPeters was unapologetic and insisted that everything she did was geared toward trying to uproot what she believed was fraud. She claimed her actions were done for the greater good.\n\nPeters was convicted of allowing a man to misuse a security card to access the election system and being deceptive about that person’s identity. The man was affiliated with MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell, a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal the election from Trump.",

U.S. District Judge Anne M.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York’s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration’s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration — which challenged the law under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration — had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.\n\nThe Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.”\n\n“As I said from the start, our laws protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe,” James said in a statement Friday. “I will always stand up for New Yorkers and the rule of law.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left for the Justice Department.\n\nNardacci, appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, wrote that her job was not to evaluate the desirability of the Green Light Law as a policy matter. Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration’s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.\n\nThe administration, she wrote, has “failed to state such a claim.”\n\nThe Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.\n\nUnder the law, people who don’t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver’s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a “standard driver’s license.” It does not apply to commercial driver’s licenses.\n\nThe Justice Department’s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlighted a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.\n\nIn 2020, during Trump’s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.\n\nThe governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.\n\nIn the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York’s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk’s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information “remains available to federal immigration authorities” through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts as the “Trump-Kennedy Center,” leading to almost immediate legal action.\n\nDespite the 79-year-old president trying to muscle the rebrand into the country’s living rooms while hosting what he called “THE TRUMP KENNEDY CENTER HONORS” on Tuesday evening, CBS aired the 48th Kennedy Center Honors with the institution’s long-standing name, noted The Washington Post.\n\nBehind the scenes, the paper said CBS News standards had circulated guidance telling staff to stick with “Kennedy Center,” noting the board’s vote alone doesn’t make the change official because Congress would have to approve it.\n\nThe network also trimmed Trump’s opening remarks from roughly 12 minutes to about two minutes for viewers at home, cutting out some of his freewheeling asides—including his crack at the laughing crowd as “miserable, horrible people.”\n\nThe on-air snub came as CBS’s relationship with Trump has taken repeated hits, often with 60 Minutes at the center.\n\nIn July, Paramount, the network’s parent company, agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s presidential library to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over what he claimed was deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a deal the company announced without an apology.\n\nSince then, Trump has continued his attack on the network, even as CBS has been accused of bending over backwards to placate him. In November, it aired a 28-minute version of a Trump 60 Minutes sit-down with Norah O’Donnell, as well as a separate 73-minute extended cut.\n\nYet it left out a tense exchange in which Trump expressed irritation over questions about a crypto mogul he pardoned amid reports of a $2 billion deal tied to a Trump family crypto venture. The edits also omitted Trump’s comment about CBS’s payout related to the settlement.\n\nThen came the network’s leadership turmoil. After Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, 42, installed Bari Weiss, 41, as CBS News editor-in-chief in October, the MAGA-curious boss spiked a 60 Minutes segment at the eleventh hour last weekend.\n\nIt featured interviews with deportees sent by the Trump administration to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador, with Weiss claiming the segment needed more work before it could air. Her last-minute decision sparked concerns of White House interference and triggered fury inside the newsroom.\n\nThe episode spiraled further when the segment surfaced anyway after a Canadian broadcaster aired it, and Paramount Skydance began issuing copyright takedowns to scrub reposts.\n\nSet against concerns over political pressure and corporate leverage, the network’s refusal to call the venue the “Trump Kennedy Center” on its biggest annual cultural broadcast—and cutting Trump’s screen time—has raised more than a few eyebrows.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted CBS and the Kennedy Center for comment.",

    "description": "“Consumers are just in this, whatever the highest price is, is the price they're going to focus on,” Harvard professor Jason Furman said.",
    "fullText": "As President Donald Trump struggles to address Americans’ growing affordability concerns, he has gotten some sympathy from one of former President Barack Obama’s former top economists.\n\nJason Furman, Harvard Kennedy School of Government professor and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday pessimistic consumers have overlooked gas prices that have remained affordable, making Trump’s job of addressing the affordability crisis more challenging.\n\nGas prices in December marked the lowest they’ve been all year, according to data from motor club AAA, with unleaded gasoline $0.18 cheaper nationally this year compared to last. National average prices reached their cheapest on Monday, hitting $2.85 a gallon. That hasn’t stopped consumer confidence falling to its lowest level since April, and approval ratings indicating more Americans disagree with how Trump is handling the economy.\n\n“I’ve been puzzled,” Furman said. “When you’re in government, you’re told, politically, the one price that matters is the price of gasoline. That’s the one price that’s been great this year. And I sort of feel a tiny bit bad for President Trump that he doesn’t get any credit for that.”\n\nTrump has continued to offer his own mixed signals on the affordability crisis, including saying in a primetime address last week he inherited an economic “mess” from the Biden administration, offering to cut checks for millions of military personnel for housing supplements, while simultaneously calling the economy the strongest it’s been.\n\nAccording to Furman, Trump also has a bit of a tough crowd: Consumers have been concerned about inflation and the price of groceries, which have increased nearly 30% over the past five years, making it more difficult to assuage economic anxieties, even when there are other optimistic signals.\n\n“Consumers are just in this sort of, whatever the highest price is, is the price they’re going to focus on and be upset about,” he said. “And that’s a really hard problem to solve economically or politically.”\n\nConflicting economic indicators extend beyond prices, Furman said. The U.S. saw its strongest economic growth in two years last quarter with a 4.3% GDP growth, exceeding past analysts’ estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate creeped up to 4.6% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, markedly higher than last November’s 4.2% and above 4%, which is considered reasonable.",

    "fullText": "The US just escalated its clash with Europe over tech regulation.\n\nThe State Department said it has barred five Europeans, including the EU's former Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton and four members of digital campaign groups, from entering the country over what it called \"censorship\" of tech platforms.\n\nThe visa bans were met with backlash from European leaders on X, who accused Washington of intimidation and political overreach.\n\nThe dispute centers on the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which imposes obligations on major tech platforms — many of which are based in the US — to police content and curb anti-competitive behavior. Companies in breach of it can be fined up to 6% of their global annual revenue.\n\nIn a post on X late Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department would block leading figures of what he called \"the global censorship-industrial complex\" from entering the US.\n\n\"For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,\" Rubio wrote. \"The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.\"\n\nFor far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose.

Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, named Breton among the five European individuals sanctioned, accusing him of using the EU's Digital Services Act to pressure Elon Musk and X during his tenure as commissioner for the internal market.\n\nShe also named Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, Clare Melford of the Global Disinformation Index, and HateAid co-CEOs Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon, accusing them of pressuring US platforms over online speech. None of the four campaigners immediately responded to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nRubio added that the US was \"ready and willing to expand this list\" unless officials reversed course, framing the move as a defense of free expression and US sovereignty.\n\nThe back-and-forth has largely played out on X, a platform that was hit with a $140 million fine earlier this month for breaching the Digital Services Act.\n\nBreton responded in Tuesday X post by invoking McCarthy-era politics, asking, \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"\n\nHe added, \"To our American friends: 'Censorship isn't where you think it is.'\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also condemned the visa restrictions, describing them in a Wednesday X post as coercive measures aimed at undermining Europe's digital sovereignty.\n\n\"The rules governing the European Union's digital space are not meant to be determined outside Europe,\" he said.\n\nThe European Commission \"strongly\" condemned the US decision, adding that the EU has the sovereign right to regulate its digital market and would seek clarification from US authorities.\n\nIs McCarthy’s witch hunt back? 🧹\n\nAs a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA 🇪🇺\n\nTo our American friends: “Censorship isn’t where you think it is.”\n\n\"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X on Wednesday. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"\n\nGérard Araud, France's former ambassador to the US, said the dispute reflects a deeper rupture, writing on X that \"the West\" no longer exists and that Europe is now alone in defending its interests and values.\n\nHodenberg and Ballon told Business Insider in a joint statement that they are \"not surprised\" by the move, calling it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Despite the significant strain and restrictions placed on us and our families by US government measures, we will continue our work with all our strength — now more than ever,\" the duo said.\n\nThe dispute has been years in the making — and Musk's X has often been at the center of it.\n\nMusk cheered the US move to sanction the officials, writing on X: \"This is so great.\"\n\nThis is so great 🤩 https://t.co/fXAfNbwEVf\n\nBreton repeatedly clashed with Musk after he bought Twitter in 2022 and pledged to loosen moderation in the name of free speech.\n\nAs the then-internal market commissioner, Breton warned that X could face fines or even be barred from the European Union if it failed to comply with EU law, later overseeing a formal investigation into the platform regarding disinformation and content moderation.\n\nThose confrontations turned X into a symbol of the broader transatlantic fight over who sets the rules for online speech — a conflict that has now spilled from regulation into geopolitics.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has attributed the recent uptick in the unemployment rate to a reduction in government jobs. He also highlighted that all new jobs are being created in the private sector.\n\nTrump, during the Most Favored Nation drug pricing press conference on Friday, acknowledged the rise in the unemployment rate but emphasized that “the only reason” it happened was due to a significant decrease in government jobs.\n\nHe underscored that the reduction of government jobs has been unprecedented and will continue. The president explained that the federal workforce had “millions and millions” of people having jobs who “never even showed up.”\n\nBezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom\n\nAn EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nTrump further claimed that he “could reduce unemployment to 2%,1% or practically zero by just hiring people” into the federal government, even though these jobs are unnecessary. “We don’t need 10 people to fill one job,” he stated.\n\nThe president stated, “100% of our new jobs are in the private sector. So this is for the last number of months…That’s the way to make America great again.”\n\nTrump also suggested that the private sector job growth would further improve with the ongoing construction of new buildings, AI, and auto plants across the country.\n\nTrump’s comments come on the heels of the U.S. labor market showing signs of cooling in November as job growth narrowly met already subdued expectations, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 64,000 in November, driven by stronger-than-expected private-sector hiring, which added 69,000 jobs, as Trump highlighted.\n\nSee Also: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nHowever, a 5,000-job drop in government employment offset some of the gains, keeping overall job growth muted. The reduction in the overall federal workforce comes due to the government shutdown as well as Trump’s sweeping job cuts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nLeading economists and experts have raised concerns about the slowing U.S. labor market following the release of the November data. Economist Justin Wolfers said it is unclear whether the economy is already in a recession, but noted that employment trends point to a clear slowdown. He also stated that the economy created “zero jobs” since Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. However, Wolfers’ claims could not be confirmed by data.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a March presidential memorandum to revoke the security clearance of prominent Washington attorney Mark Zaid, ruling that the order — which also targeted 14 other individuals — could not be applied to him.\n\nThe decision marked the administration’s second legal setback on Tuesday, after the Supreme Court declined to allow Trump to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area, capping a first year in office in which President Donald Trump’s efforts to impose a sweeping agenda and pursue retribution against political adversaries have been repeatedly slowed by the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amir Ali in Washington granted Zaid's request for a preliminary injunction, after he sued the Trump administration in May over the revocation of his security clearance. Zaid's request called it an act of “improper political retribution” that jeopardized his ability to continue representing clients in sensitive national security cases.\n\nThe March presidential memorandum singled out Zaid and 14 other individuals who the White House asserted were unsuitable to retain their clearances because it was “no longer in the national interest.” The list included targets of Trump’s fury from both the political and legal spheres, including former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Joe Biden and members of his family.\n\nThe action was part of a much broader retribution campaign that Trump has waged since returning to the White House, including directing specific Justice Department investigations against perceived adversaries and issuing sweeping executive orders targeting law firms over legal work he does not like.\n\nIn August, the Trump administration said it was revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials. Ordering the revocation of clearances has been a favored retributive tactic that Trump has wielded — or at least tried to — against high-profile political figures, lawyers and intelligence officials in his second term.\n\nZaid said in his lawsuit that he has represented clients across the political spectrum over nearly 35 years, including government officials, law enforcement and military officials and whistleblowers. In 2019, he represented an intelligence community whistleblower whose account of a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy helped set the stage for the first of two impeachment cases against Trump in his first term.\n\n\"This court joins the several others in this district that have enjoined the government from using the summary revocation of security clearances to penalize lawyers for representing people adverse to it,\" Ali wrote in his order.\n\nAli emphasized that his order does not prevent the government from revoking or suspending Zaid’s clearance for reasons independent of the presidential memorandum and through normal agency processes. The preliminary injunction does not go into effect until January 13.\n\nZaid said in a statement, “This is not just a victory for me, it’s an indictment of the Trump administration’s attempts to intimidate and silence the legal community, especially lawyers who represent people who dare to question or hold this government accountable.\"",

    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump's newly appointed envoy to Greenland said Tuesday that the Republican administration is looking to begin a conversation with residents of the semi-autonomous Danish territory about the best way forward for the strategically important island.\n\nIn his first extended comments since being appointed to the role this week, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the Trump administration isn't going to “go in there trying to conquer anybody\" or try to \"to take over anybody’s country.”\n\nThe governor's comments seemed somewhat at odds with Trump, who has repeatedly said the U.S. needs to take over the Arctic territory for the sake of U.S. security and has not ruled out military force to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island.\n\n“Well, I think our discussions should be with the actual people in Greenland — the Greenlanders,” Landry said in an appearance on Fox News' “The Will Cain Show.” “What are they looking for? What opportunities have they not gotten? Why haven’t they gotten the protection that they actually deserve?”\n\nTrump's announcement of Landry's appointment has once again stirred anxiety in Denmark and Europe.\n\nDenmark’s foreign minister told Danish broadcasters that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to his ministry.\n\n”We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said in a joint statement Monday. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country. Not even with an argument about international security.”\n\nTrump called repeatedly for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland during his presidential transition and in the early months of his second term. In March, Vice President JD Vance visited a remote U.S. military base in Greenland and accused Denmark of under-investing there.\n\nThe issue gradually drifted out of the headlines, but in August, Danish officials summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen following a report that at least three people with connections to Trump had carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.\n\nThe Trump administration did not offer any warning ahead of the announcement of Landry's appointment, according to a Danish government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe administration also has yet to provide any details about the appointment to Congress, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump is renewing the Greenland debate at a moment when he has no shortage of foreign policy crises to dealing with, including maintaining a fragile truce in Gaza and negotiating an end to Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of “picking fights with friends” at such a difficult moment around the globe.\n\n“Greenland’s sovereignty is not up for debate,” Shaheen said. \"Denmark is a critical NATO ally that has stood side by side with the U.S.”",

    "description": "There has been an alarming spike in immigrants dying while in ICE detention during the Trump administration.",
    "fullText": "It’s official: December was the deadliest month for immigrants in ICE custody since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for those in ICE custody since 2004. In December, that trend continued, with seven immigrants dying in ICE detention, including four that died within a four day span, according to death notices published by ICE. Three of the deceased were held at facilities in Texas before they died. Four of the deceased died within four days of each other.\n\nFrancisco Gaspar-Andres, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala died on December 3, after being held at Camp East Montana in Texas since September. In his notice, ICE noted that although his “cause of death is pending, medical staff attributed it to natural liver and kidney failure.” The new detention facility at Fort Bliss has reportedly already violated dozens of federal standards for immigrant detention since welcoming detainees in August.\n\nPete Sumalo Montejo, a 72-year-old Filipino man who was previously convicted of child sexual abuse, died on December 5 at the Montgomery Processing Center in Texas. ICE reported that Montejo had suffered a number of illnesses throughout his time in custody: In June he was admitted for shortness of breath and hypoxia, and between July and November he was hospitalized several times for illnesses such as anemia and septic shock resulting from pneumonia.\n\nShiraz Fatehali Sachwani, a 48 year-old man from Pakistan, died on December 6, after being held at Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, since June. He was admitted to the hospital in November after experiencing low oxygen levels and tachycardia.\n\nJean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian man detained at Delaney Hall Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey, died on December 12 from “suspected natural causes.” Immigrants held at Delaney Hall previously said that they were starved.\n\nFouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean man, died in ICE custody December 14 at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. Abdulkadir’s sudden death is reportedly the second to occur at that facility this year, and is currently being investigated by Pennsylvania State Police and the Clearfield County coroner.\n\nDelvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old man from Nicaragua was pronounced dead on December 14, just one day after he was scheduled to be deported. He was discovered unresponsive and without a pulse at the Adams County Detention Center in Colorado on December 4, removed to a medical facility, and declared dead 10 days later.\n\nNenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old man from Bulgaria, died in ICE custody December 15 at the North Lake Processing Center in Michigan. While ICE wrote that they suspected he died of natural causes, his cause of death is under investigation.\n\nICE’s webpage dedicated to Detainee Death Reporting lists only 15 deaths in 2025—not including any from this month. However, at least 20 immigrants had already died in ICE custody as of October, according to NPR.\n\nICE is required to publish information about an in-custody death within 30 days.\n\nPresident Trump plans on ringing in the New Year by garnishing the wages of over 5 million student debtors currently in default on their loans, The Washington Post first reported.\n\nStarting January 7, the Department of Education plans to withhold a portion of the wages of around 1,000 defaulted borrowers. The number will gradually increase within the following months.\n\nNo, JD Vance will not be our first “Chad” president.\n\nThe vice president shared a series of photographs to X Monday showing himself valiantly running physical training drills with Navy Seals at Base Coronado, in California. Vance was photographed running down the beach, carrying a heavy log, climbing a large cargo net, and even rowing. Another set of photographs showed him speaking with officers, and posing for a photograph in front of a large American flag.\n\n“They took it easy on me and I still feel like I got hit by a freight train,” Vance wrote on X, recapping his 90-minute PT session. “So grateful to all of our warriors who keep us safe and keep the highest standards anywhere in the world!” Vance previously served a four-year stint in the public affairs section in the 2nd Marine Aircraft.\n\nObviously, Vance’s critics were not impressed.\n\n“Cool, man—but when you’re done cosplaying, can you and your boss do something about housing and grocery prices? Thanks,” Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, wrote on X.\n\n“It’s the middle of the workday. While Americans are grinding to make Christmas work, the vice president is burning taxpayer dollars pretending to be a Navy SEAL,” Christopher Hale, a former Democratic congressional candidate, wrote on X.\n\nEven Vance couldn’t help but make fun of himself. He shared an edited version of the photograph that included his bloated, meme-ified face.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear what prompted Vance’s recent cosplaying adventure. Perhaps it has something to do with his recent presidential endorsement from Erika Kirk, a closely-held friend of the vice president. Or maybe it has something to do with his slipping poll numbers.\n\nA recent survey by AtlasIntel found that while Vance was still the leading pick to become the Republican nominee in 2028, a majority of Republicans no longer support him. Only 46.7 percent of respondents said they would pick Vance over other figures, down from 54.6 percent in a September poll.\n\nMeanwhile, a straw poll taken by Fox News at Turning Point USA’s Amerifest this past weekend found that 84.2 percent of respondents said they would like to see Vance as the Republican nominee in 2028, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis trailing far behind him. In order to claim the full support of MAGA, it seems Vance may have decided it’s time to prove himself more than a sniveling debate kid.\n\nThe Justice Department is now downplaying the Epstein files they took so long to release by claiming that they’re full of “untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.”\n\n“The Department of Justice has officially released nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein,” the DOJ wrote Tuesday on X. “Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.”\n\n“Nevertheless, out of our commitment to the law and transparency, the DOJ is releasing these documents with the legally required protections for Epstein’s victims.”\n\nWhile there certainly is some uncorroborated information in the files, there is also a wealth of new, possibly incriminating evidence about President Trump. One file contains an email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 that reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\nAnother file contained a 2019 letter from Epstein addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he said, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nEven as more information rolls in, it should come as no surprise that the Justice Department—which has been completely subservient to the president—continues to provide cover for him even as they release the heavily redacted files.\n\n“‘We’re releasing the documents, but please know in advance they’re fake, irrelevant, already debunked, totally harmless, and also important enough to issue a press statement about,’” one conservative X user posted. “If the DOJ tells you what to think before you read the documents, you already know they’re lying.”\n\nA bunch of masked male Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in tactical gear broke into the women’s bathroom of Cato nutrition bar factory in New York, even forcing a stall open while a woman in there used the toilet. They can be heard telling her to pull her pants up.\n\nICE agents illegally break into a woman's bathroom in a NY nutrition bar manufacturing plant. \"Pull up your pants,\" says a male agent. The agents only had a warrant to review employer documents. They didn't have a warrant to search for, detain, or arrest anyone there. pic.twitter.com/CnsGwkJzG4\n\nThe raid occurred in September, but the troubling footage was just recently revealed in court filings.\n\nThe officers justified their invasive actions by telling Cato’s owners that they had a warrant for a violent felon. In reality, the warrant they did have only allowed them to go into the building and seize documents, not kidnap a woman while she was on the toilet.\n\nICE eventually detained and questioned 57 people, even those who asked for a lawyer. At least 21 were deported and separated from their families.\n\n“I guess we found the men going into women’s bathrooms,” one X user mused.\n\nThe government found a photograph of Donald Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Steve Bannon’s phone. So, why did they redact it?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Department of Justice Monday, one email appeared to be from a federal investigator who said they’d discovered something while digging through Bannon’s iPhone 7.\n\n“As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon’s phone,” the email stated, passing it forward “in case it was of any importance” to someone handling “both cases.”\n\n“Thanks very much for flagging—no need to do anything on this one,” the person responds.\n\nDespite the fact that the Epstein Files Transparency Act only required the Trump administration to redact identifiable information of survivors—something that the government failed to do—the photograph of Trump and Maxwell was redacted in its entirety in the DOJ’s release. The sender and recipients’ names have also all been redacted.\n\nSo, what is it about this photograph in particular that warranted redaction?\n\nOver the course of his long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was photographed several times with Maxwell. The two attended parties and fashion events, and even traveled together.\n\nIt seems that Trump may be receiving some special treatment. In other photographs released as part of the government’s document dumps, former President Bill Clinton’s face remained visible while the faces of some other individuals were redacted. The DOJ even went so far as to release a statement to get ahead of the “untrue and sensationalist claims” about Trump contained in their own release.\n\nThe batch of files released Monday contained multiple disturbing revelations, including one email that suggested Trump flew on Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported,” and Epstein’s apparent suicide note that mentioned Trump’s love of “young, nubile girls.”\n\nEpstein files leaked on Monday night confirmed what so many people already suspected: President Trump spent much more time with Epstein—and young women—than he’s said he has.\n\nAn email from an assistant U.S. attorney from January 2020 reads, “For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald Trump traveled on Epstein’s private jet many more times than has previously been reported.”\n\n“He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was present,” the attorney continued, noting that Trump brought his wife, son Eric, and daughter Tiffany at times.\n\nOn one flight, the only three listed passengers were Trump,  Epstein, and a 20-year-old whose name has been redacted, likely a victim of Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nThis email completely undermines Trump’s various stories regarding his friendship with Epstein, from saying that he viewed Epstein as some kind of creep to be kept at arm’s length, to saying he barely knew him. Regardless of how their relationship ended, the president was flying around on a private jet with a sexual predator who abused children—which explains the lengths the administration went to keep these files from coming out even as a notable portion of their voter base recognized it as an issue.\n\nIt will be interesting to hear Trump and his helpers explain this one. Why would Trump fly on the sex trafficker’s plane multiple times? Did he just not know then too?\n\n“Trump was on Epstein’s plane, with Epstein victims,” one X user wrote. “Yet another reason why he was trying to keep the Epstein files from ever seeing the light of day.”\n\nWhat do Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar, and Donald Trump all have in common?\n\nBuried in the latest trove of documents released by the Justice Department Monday, a postcard addressed to “L.N.” or Larry Nassar, the former U.S. gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of women and girls, mentioned Trump by name—and more.\n\n“As you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home,” Epstein wrote in the alleged letter, appearing to reference his later death by suicide. “Good luck! We shared one thing… our love and caring for young ladies and the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch,’ whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,” he continued, signing off “J. Epstein.”\n\nThe government also released an image of the envelope, which was addressed from Epstein to “inmate” Nassar, and was postmarked August 13, 2019, three days after Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York City. The letter, marked as return to sender, was addressed to Nassar at USP Arizona, where the high-profile pedophile had been held before he was transferred in 2018.\n\nLikely recognizing the harm that this letter’s authenticity would inflict on the president, the Department of Justice quickly announced \nTuesday morning that they would investigate its legitimacy. Less than two hours later they declared the FBI has concluded the note is a “FAKE”, citing the handwriting, postmark date, and an incorrect return address format for inmates. However, the DOJ did not choose to publish the results of the handwriting analysis originally obtained in July 2020, when establishing its authenticity would have been pertinent to a potential wrongful death suit based upon Epstein’s in-custody death.\n\nIt had previously been reported that Epstein attempted to reach out to Nassar, but that his letter had been returned. The government’s documents suggest that the letter was first discovered weeks later in September 2019, and was submitted for a handwriting analysis in July 2020. It’s not clear what the results of the writing test were.\n\nThe latest batch of documents released by the Department of Justice mention Trump’s name hundreds of times. One 2020 email sent by a federal prosecutor asserted that Trump had flown on Epstein’s private jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).”\n\nThe previous batch of documents published Friday were heavily criticized for being incomplete. While the government made sweeping redactions to entire pages of documents, it apparently failed to redact the names of multiple survivors.\n\nJust days after plastering his name onto the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Trump will be naming a new class of battleships after himself.\n\nTrump is planning to make the naming announcement of the Navy’s new battleships alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Monday. An anonymous Pentagon official told The New York Times that Trump will call them “Trump-class” battleships.\n\nThe ship will be part of Trump’s vision of a new “Golden Fleet.” Each ship is expected to cost at least $5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs The New Republic’s Matt Ford wrote earlier this week—as bleak as the Gulf of America, the Trump Kennedy Center, the War Department, and others sound, Trump won’t be president forever. If he can change them just that easily, there’s no reason the next Democratic administration should hesitate to change them back.\n\nCBS editor-in-chief Bari Weiss told 60 Minutes producers she was killing their story on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador, where Trump deported more than 250 Venezuelan immigrants,  because it did “not present the administration’s argument.”\n\n“What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing?” Weiss wrote in a Sunday memo. “Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record.”\n\nWeiss’s decision to kill the story because it didn’t have enough perspective from DHS officials—who had already declined to speak with 60 Minutes—was met with uproar when it was leaked on Monday. But she doubled down.\n\n“We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,” she said on a Monday staffing call, insinuating that the testimonies of CECOT inmates were insufficient.\n\nKilling a story about a brutal megaprison because the folks that are sending people to the brutal megaprison aren’t featured prominently enough has not been favorably received.\n\n“The Trump administration sent dozens [of] young men with no criminal record to be tortured and abused in a foreign prison,” podcaster Jon Favreau wrote. “@bariweiss can keep reporting, delaying, or kill the story altogether, but the basic facts have been well-documented in multiple court cases, including by Trump’s own DOJ and Trump-appointed judges.”\n\n“Bari Weiss’s main criticism is that 60 Minutes doesn’t advance the story,” writer Randye Hoder chimed. “But her solution is to ask Stephen Miller to regurgitate the same talking points this admin has given from the get-go, which we’ve heard a gazillion times)!”\n\nThe Trump administration has yet to comment. View the trailer for the scrapped segment here.\n\nHere's the deleted trailer for the now-\"delayed\" segment. It's almost impressive how much damage Bari Weiss has done to CBS News in such a short period of time. \n\nSomeone quickly schedule a prime-time Town Hall with Alan Dershowitz to rectify the harm:pic.twitter.com/382gRG5Lgp https://t.co/3gHRKNES2y",

    "description": "Photos show Greenland's culture, which has both Inuit and Danish influences. Its industry, cuisine, and more are shaped by the weather and history.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to acquire Greenland, the world's largest island and an autonomous Danish territory.\n\nThe president resurfaced the issue this week by appointing Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, as a special envoy to Greenland.\n\nTrump told the BBC that acquiring the island is necessary for \"national protection,\" adding, \"We have to have it.\"\n\nIn an interview on Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told TV2 that the appointment was \"completely unacceptable.\" Denmark said it will summon the US ambassador to explain.\n\nEarlier this year, US Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, traveled to the island. Following criticism from Denmark and Greenlanders over the trip, the Vances' itinerary was amended so they only visited the US military base on Greenland, a change the Danish government called \"very positive.\"\n\nGreenland is known for its long, freezing winters, stunning glaciers, and fishing industry, but in many ways, it remains a frozen mystery to much of the world.\n\nPart of that mystique is because it's been difficult for some tourists to travel to, except by cruise ship or lengthy plane rides. A new international airport is making the country more accessible, including to US residents.\n\nMarianne A. Stenbaek, a professor of cultural studies at McGill University who studies Greenlandic art and literature, described Greenland as a \"modern society with a traditional touch.\" That's because Denmark colonized it hundreds of years ago, but aspects of its Inuit traditions remain.\n\nFrom its arts to its cuisine, Greenland has a culture all its own.\n\nThe country is a little bigger than Mexico. It's also much colder. About 80% of Greenland's 836,330 square miles are buried in snow and ice. An enormous national park, the world's largest, covers much of the northeast.\n\nThe island has long made it of interest to many other countries for military purposes and as a source of natural resources, from rare minerals to natural gas and oil.\n\nBut to Greenlanders, it's simply home.\n\nPre-Inuit groups, including members of the Saqqaq culture, came to the island around 2,500 BCE via Canada. They settled in northern, western, and southeastern Greenland. Today's Greenland Inuit population is descended from the Thule people, who moved into the country's north from Alaska through Canada around 1,000 years ago.\n\nBetween 985 and roughly 1450 CE, Vikings lived and then died out in Western Greenland. Erik the Red was the one who called the icy island Greenland. In Greenlandic, its name is Kalaallit Nunaat.\n\nDanish-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede established a settlement in what's now Nuuk, Greenland's capital, in 1721. Over the centuries, Denmark's culture profoundly changed the country.\n\nGreenland remained a Danish colony until 1953 and became an autonomous territory in 1979. It has its own parliament, known as the Inatsisartut.\n\nWhile the country self-governs its domestic matters, Denmark retains jurisdiction over defense and foreign affairs.\n\nAround 56,000 people make Greenland their home.\n\nJust under 90% are Inuit, though most also have some European ancestry, according to genetic testing published by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2015. Danish people make up the rest of the population. Most live in coastal cities or communities.\n\nKalaallisut, also known as Greenlandic, is an Inuit language and is the official language of the country. It's widely spoken, though some groups in the east speak Tunumiit, according to the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nMost residents also speak Danish, which is taught as a second language in schools.\n\nThe population has long depended on fishing for their livelihoods. However, it's not enough to support the entire country. Denmark heavily supplements its budget with about $511 million annually, according to The BBC.\n\n\"The economy has been difficult,\" Stenbaek said. Tourism and the country's natural resources may be its future.\n\nWhether they're hoping to spot narwhals or want to glimpse glaciers, nature-loving tourists are drawn to Greenland.\n\nFor a long time, it was difficult to get to the island by plane. Nuuk only opened its international airport in November 2024. Before that, only a few airports had runways long enough to land large jets. But as of earlier this year, Americans can hop on a direct flight from New York to Nuuk.\n\nIlulissat, which has an ice fjord on UNESCO's World Heritage list, and Qaqortoq are also getting international airports, Reuters reported.\n\nTo get ready for the surge of tourists, some residents are buying snowmobiles to rent out, The New York Times reported. New hotels are opening, too.\n\nGreenland has a history of mining cryolite, which is used in aluminum smelting. A recent documentary, \"The White Gold of Greenland,\" claimed that for over 100 years, Danish mining companies extracted billions worth of the mineral, and Greenland reaped very little of the benefit, Variety reported.\n\nThat's not a history it would want to repeat if it taps its deposits of uranium, gold, natural gas, lithium, and other resources. While some see mining as an opportunity to enrich the country, others have concerns.\n\n\"Greenlanders are very hesitant about many aspects of mining because it impacts the nature so much,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThere are also worries about how it could affect the fishing industry, while residents in Narsaq are concerned about their health if a company moves forward with mining radioactive uranium at a nearby proposed site, The Guardian reported.\n\nDanish culture is visible in Greenland's healthcare system, educational institutions, and government. \"To that extent, it has had a huge impact,\" Stenbaek said. At the same time, authorities contributed to the loss of many aspects of the Inuits' way of life.\n\nBetween the 1950s and '70s, the Danish government forced Inuit populations to relocate from smaller settlements and communities to cities, Reuters reported. During this time, doctors implanted IUDs in thousands of Inuit girls and women, sometimes without their consent, The BBC reported. Denmark is investigating the matter and has offered counseling to those affected, AP reported last year.\n\nMembers of the Inuit community were also pressured to give up their culture and language.\n\n\"We were told to act more Danish, to speak Danish, if we wanted to be something,\" Nadja Arnaaraq Kreutzmann, a Nuuk resident, recently told Reuters.\n\nFrom sewing national costumes to making jewelry to carving animal tusks, Inuit people in Greenland are finding ways to continue traditional practices.\n\n\"I'm concerned if we do not give the old traditions to younger people, it'll die out within 35 years,\" Greenlander Vera Mølgaard told National Geographic.\n\nQupanuk Olsen, a new member of Greenland's Parliament, has spent over five years gaining more than 320,000 Instagram followers by highlighting the country's food and traditions.\n\nSome estimates put Greenland's Lutheran population at 90%, heavily influenced by Hans Egede, the missionary who came to the island in 1721. His statue stands in Nuuk, and some want it removed, saying it's a symbol of the start of colonization, the AP reported.\n\nMany Greenlanders incorporate traditional religious practices into their services, Stenbaek said. They also sing hymns in Greenlandic, she said.\n\nThe city's architecture is Scandinavian, but its artwork incorporates Inuit tales, according to Lonely Planet. That duality is Nuuk in a nutshell.\n\n\"It's very much, in many ways, like a modern Scandinavian city,\" Stenbaek said. \"And at the same time, the Greenlandic culture, the traditional culture, is still there.\"\n\nThere are plenty of cafés, restaurants, and shopping for residents and tourists to visit.\n\nSmall settlements remain along the west and east coasts, Stenbaek said. Some have fewer than 100 people.\n\n\"They live very much like they would have lived 100 years ago,\" Stenbaek said. That means relying on fishing and other traditional knowledge to survive.\n\nIn the more remote areas of the country, it's not always easy to get from place to place.\n\n\"If you have to go from settlement to settlement, it's either by boat or dog sleigh or skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIf the water is too icy for boats, Greenlanders might have to jump in a helicopter. There are dog sled races in Uummannaq, but it's also a practical mode of transportation in the snowy weather. The same goes for snowmobiles.\n\nFar north regions experience polar nights in the winter, when the sun doesn't rise above the horizon. The opposite happens in the summer, when Greenland gets nonstop daylight for a couple of months.\n\nBoth are significant to Greenlanders.\n\nSince the sun is not visible in the winter, when spring comes it brings life back,\" photographer Inuuteq Storch told The Guardian in 2024. \"That time of total darkness is very spiritual.\"\n\nGreenland is a maritime culture, according to Stenbaek. \"Everything depends on ice and water,\" she said.\n\nIn some parts of the country, winters can last through April. The temperatures can be frigid, with some regions getting down to -30 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSummers in northern towns are still chilly, averaging around 41 degrees Fahrenheit, per The Guardian. Temperatures are getting warmer, though.\n\nPlenty of Greenlanders' pastimes involve braving the cold.\n\n\"Many of them are connected directly to nature, like fishing, hunting, skiing,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nThe snowy landscape and arctic waters surrounding the island are habitats for musk ox, reindeer, seals, polar bears, whales, and dozens of bird species.\n\nBerries, flowers, and cottongrass also grow in some parts of the country.\n\nSled dogs aren't just companions. They're often working animals, and have a long history of surviving alongside humans. Greenland's first dogs arrived with the Thule people hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe husky-like dogs have thick coats, muscular bodies for pulling sleds, and a digestive system suited to high-fat diets, as reported by Newsweek.\n\nSome dog sled races ban the use of other breeds, according to the Greenlandic Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nLong before there were grocery stores in Greenland, locals survived by hunting and fishing. Since the island doesn't have a lot of plant life, they got their vitamin C from whale skin, The New York Times reported.\n\nEven today, there isn't much farming in Greenland, though people do raise sheep in the south.\n\nWhile supermarkets sell imported food, like milk and vegetables, they'll also stock local fare, including fish, seal, and whale. Some Greenlanders also supplement their shopping by hunting reindeer, ox, and other animals.\n\n\"In Greenland, we have the world's wildest kitchen,\" chef Inunnguaq Hegelund recently told NPR.\n\nAs the planet heats up, Greenland has started to melt. Its glaciers are shrinking, and the permafrost is disappearing. In 2016, researchers found that the Greenland ice sheet was losing the equivalent of 110 million Olympic-sized swimming pools of water each year.\n\n\"It had an influence on roads and airports and houses when all of a sudden the earth starts to unfreeze,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nIt's started to change animals' migration patterns, and polar bears have had to adapt to a new way of hunting without sea ice.\n\nThe US National Science Foundation has been studying Greenland's ice sheet for decades.\n\nThe country's location also makes it the perfect location to obtain ice cores, test cold-weather engineering, monitor climate change, and study the elusive Greenland shark.\n\nOver the years, Greenland has become increasingly independent from Denmark. In 2008, it voted for a referendum granting them more autonomy. Many want to go even further and become completely independent from the Danish kingdom.\n\nAbout 80% of Greenlanders support the move, according to recent polling. Yet one longtime backer of the movement has recently become a bit more hesitant.\n\nAqqaluk Lynge is the former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a nongovernmental organization representing Inuit people in several countries. He told NPR in February 2025 that he now supports Greenland staying tied to Denmark because \"if Greenland secedes from Denmark, it will be taken by United States.\"\n\n\"This is surprising because Aqqaluk used to be head of much of the independence movement,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nDonald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to buy Greenland. In a speech to the US Congress earlier this year, he said that if Greenland chose to join, \"we welcome you into the United States of America.\"\n\nIt may be one of the reasons the Democratic party, which advocates for a slow approach to independence, won in recent elections, Stenbaek said. The majority of Greenlanders, 85%, according to a January 2025 opinion poll, don't want to become part of the US.\n\n\"Greenlanders want to remain Greenlandic,\" Stenbaek said.\n\nShe said she thought it was important for Greenland to strengthen connections with other countries, Canada in particular. They have a lot in common in terms of environmental concerns and large Inuit populations, she said.\n\n\"Both are Arctic countries,\" she said. \"They would be quite strong.\"",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump’s nemesis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, has registered the highest approval rating among current political leaders, a new poll has revealed.\n\nA Gallup survey shows that Powell—whom Trump has long berated while demanding interest-rate cuts—is more highly regarded by Americans than the president, members of Trump’s Cabinet, and leading Democratic figures.\n\nThe poll shows Powell’s approval rating at 44 percent, compared with Trump’s second-term low of 36 percent. The president’s current approval is only slightly above his all-time low of 34 percent, recorded in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is the only other political figure in the poll to break 40 percent, with an approval rating of 41 percent.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (28 percent) and Senate GOP Leader John Thune (34 percent) post the lowest ratings, with Vice President JD Vance (39 percent), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (36 percent), House Speaker Mike Johnson (35 percent), and embattled Attorney General Pam Bondi (36 percent) also registering uninspiring numbers.\n\nTrump is likely to be particularly irritated by how Americans view Powell. The president has repeatedly called for Powell to resign—at times even suggesting he could fire him as chair of the U.S. central bank—while unleashing a steady stream of insults.\n\nTrump has spent months attacking Powell as “stupid,” a “dummy,” and a “knucklehead” for refusing to slash interest rates to offset the president’s economically damaging tariff policies. The president was so blinded by rage at Powell’s refusal to bow to his demands that he appeared to have forgotten that it was he who appointed him in the first place.\n\n“He’s a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July, despite nominating Powell in 2017.\n\nThat same month, the pair’s fractured relationship had an excruciating moment when Powell corrected Trump to his face after the president falsely claimed that renovation costs at the Fed’s Washington, D.C., headquarters totaled $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump suggested the figure had “just come out” when Powell questioned its source. After reviewing a piece of paper Trump handed him, Powell pushed back and explained that Trump was “adding a third building” to the total that “was built five years ago.”\n\n“It’s part of the overall work,” Trump insisted, prompting Powell to reply again: “It’s not new.”\n\nPowell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May 2026, has since cut interest rates three times this year as the central bank attempts to kick-start a struggling economy during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe most recent cut of 0.25 percentage points occurred on Dec. 10, lowering the benchmark rate to a range of 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the White House for comment.",

    "fullText": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to reallocate federal Homeland Security funding away from states that refuse to cooperate with certain federal immigration enforcement.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mary McElroy's ruling on Monday solidified a win for the coalition of 12 attorneys general that sued the administration earlier this year after being alerted that their states would receive drastically reduced federal grants due to their “sanctuary” jurisdictions.\n\nIn total, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency reduced more than $233 million from Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The money is part of a $1 billion program where allocations are supposed to be based on assessed risks, with states then largely passing most of the money on to police and fire departments.\n\nThe cuts were unveiled shortly after a separate federal judge in a different legal challenge ruled it was unconstitutional for the federal government to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get FEMA disaster funding.\n\nIn her 48-page ruling, McElroy found that the federal government was weighing states' police on federal immigration enforcement on whether to reduce federal funding for the Homeland Security Grant Program and others.\n\n“What else could defendants’ decisions to cut funding to specific counterterrorism programming by conspicuous round numbered amounts — including by slashing off the millions-place digits of awarded sums — be if not arbitrary and capricious? Neither a law degree nor a degree in mathematics is required to deduce that no plausible, rational formula could produce this result,” McElroy wrote.\n\nThe Trump-appointed judge then ordered the Department of Homeland Security to restore the previously announced funding allocations to the plaintiff states.\n\n“Defendants’ wanton abuse of their role in federal grant administration is particularly troublesome given the fact that they have been entrusted with a most solemn duty: safeguarding our nation and its citizens,\" McElroy wrote. \"While the intricacies of administrative law and the terms and conditions on federal grants may seem abstract to some, the funding at issue here supports vital counterterrorism and law enforcement programs.”\n\nMcElroy notably cited the recent Brown University attack, where a gunman killed two students and injured nine others, as an event where the $1 billion federal program would be vital in responding to such a tragedy.\n\n“To hold hostage funding for programs like these based solely on what appear to be defendants’ political whims is unconscionable and, at least here, unlawful,” the Rhode Island-based judge wrote in her ruling, issued little more than a week after the Brown shooting.\n\nDHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department plans on fighting the order.\n\n“This judicial sabotage threatens the safety of our states, counties, towns, and weakens the entire nation,\" McLaughlin said. \"We will fight to restore these critical reforms and protect American lives.”\n\nMeanwhile, attorneys general who sued the administration applauded the order.\n\n“This victory ensures that the Trump Administration cannot punish states that refuse to help carry out its cruel immigration agenda, particularly by denying them lifesaving funding that helps prepare for and respond to disasters and emergencies,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement.",

A combined 29 percent said they either somewhat or strongly disapproved of her work.\n\nBondi, 60, has angered MAGA loyalists this year by constantly fumbling the release of the Epstein files.\n\nAfter drip-feeding some heavily redacted documents, with the latest batch arriving on Friday, a statement by 19 of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims called out Bondi and her department, stating, “We are told that there are hundreds and thousands of pages of documents still unreleased. These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nThe poll asked their support base to rank their priorities, with winning next year’s midterms a clear winner at 63.9 percent.\n\n“Defunding woke universities” was only voted as an issue by 1.1 percent, while the base was least interested in ending the war in Ukraine, which came last.\n\n89.5 percent of voters also said they would support a moratorium on new immigration into the U.S.\n\nThe poll also saw the vice president blitz the choice of who Turning Point USA supporters would like to see succeed Trump in 2028.\n\n“JD Vance won the 2028 nomination straw poll by more than Donald Trump won the 2024 one we did two years ago,” Charlie Kirk Show producer Blake Neff wrote on X.\n\nVance, who has regularly attended Turning Point events and spoken about his faith, scored 84.2 percent of the vote. Rubio took just 4.8 percent while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earned a measly 2.9 percent. Donald Trump Jr. scored even less, with just 1.8 percent of the vote.\n\n88.3 percent of poll respondents self-identified as Republicans and 94.7 percent identified as conservatives.\n\nKolvet said the Turning Point “movement” is “all-in” for Vance as the next Republican leader.\n\nDuring the event on Sunday, Vance was cautious to fully condemn the rise of racism and antisemitism in the Republican Party.\n\nThe VP said conservatives should welcome everyone as long as they “love America.” He also said he was against using “purity tests” to work out who might be excluded from the religious movement over their beliefs, after questions arose over divisive figures such as Nick Fuentes and Candace Owens.\n\n“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during his closing speech on Sunday.\n\n“We don’t care if you’re white or Black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,” he said of Turning Point’s entry policy.\n\n“We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said.\n\nVance was more vocal about the Trump administration’s policies to end diversity and inclusion, telling the audience, “In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”",

    "description": "Europe still wants and needs to work with Trump. But this year’s made it clear they’re increasingly on their own.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s first year back in office shattered any remaining illusions among European leaders that he can be managed or controlled.\n\nHis open hostility toward the European Union has strained a transatlantic alliance that’s endured since World War II and deepened rifts between Europe’s national leaders and within the bloc, imperiling its ability to respond to Trump’s threats and taunts with the kind of unity and strength he respects.\n\nThat’s left Ukraine’s fate hanging in the balance heading into 2026, not to mention unanswered existential questions about European security at a moment when many fear Russian President Vladimir Putin’s territorial aims extend further westward beyond Ukraine.\n\nBut in many ways, Europe has survived the roller coaster — for now.\n\n“The Europeans cannot afford to cut ties and to hand in the divorce papers because they are still too dependent, especially when it comes to security and an American military commitment to defending Europe,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut, she continued, the efforts by leaders to maintain solid ties with the U.S. based on short- term interests do not mean the past year hasn’t clarified that the long-term interests are, for the moment, no longer aligned.\n\n“We need to be pretty clear-eyed,” she said. “In the old days, there was a clear mainstream understanding of the old transatlantic relationship enshrined by the Western values and norms and principles, the rules based international order. And now I think we see a competing project emerging.”\n\nThe administration is clear-eyed, too, heading into the new year.\n\nIt sees a continent losing its values and identity, beholden to liberal ideals that are doing far more to imperil European security than any missive from the White House. The act of a friend, the White House argues — as it pushes Europe to spend more on its own defense, restrict immigration and end the war in Ukraine — is to set it straight.\n\n“President Trump has great relationships with many European leaders, but he never shies away from delivering hard truths,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"The devastating impacts of unchecked migration, and those migrants’ inability to assimilate, are not just a concern for President Trump, but for Europeans themselves, who have increasingly noted immigration as one of their top concerns. These open border policies have led to widespread examples of violence, spikes in crime, and more, with detrimental impacts on the fiscal sustainability of social safety net programs.”\n\nAfter a blistering start to the year with Vice President JD Vance lecturing Europe over free speech in Munich and then tag-teaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Europeans have adjusted to Trump’s worldview — a shift, as Romania’s Nicușor Dan described it, from a “moral way of doing things to a very pragmatic and economical way of doing things” — and succeeded at bringing the White House back into the fold on several fronts.\n\nThe EU’s submission on trade, accepting a new tariff of 15 percent, limited the short-term economic damage. NATO appeased Trump with its pledge to boost defense spending by 5 percent over the next decade, cemented at its June summit — thanks largely to allowing existing, non-defense spending to count for 1.5 percent of that new total.\n\nInstead of abandoning Ukraine, Trump agreed in July to provide additional defense aid for its war with Russia as long as Europe pays for it. And Europeans have been able to withstand Trump’s August meeting with Putin in Alaska and the administration’s announcement of a 28-point peace plan crafted in secret with the Kremlin, which they have worked with the U.S. and Ukraine to revise.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Trump blasted European leaders as “weak,” asserting that they “don’t know what to do” about immigration in particular. He questioned whether European leaders should continue to be allies, saying that “it depends” on their policies and that he wouldn’t hesitate to intervene in European elections to back far-right parties challenging the very coalitions and leaders he’s currently working with.\n\nThat coincided with the issuing of a new National Security Strategy that called for “cultivating resistance” to European centrism that’s committing “civilizational suicide” and expressed disdain for the European Union, which the administration labeled as “adverse” to U.S. economic interests.”\n\nConstanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, called the Europe sections of the new NSS a “game changer” for leaders across the Atlantic that has “permanently changed” long-term strategy with the U.S.\n\n“It shouldn't be underestimated how much of a shock it was for European leaders and publics to read the Europe chapter of the National Security Strategy and to see put in writing that this administration thinks of Europe, or European political centrists, as unreliable allies and is taking such an adversarial one against them,” she said. “For 2026, we need to buckle up and plan for the worst on all counts. We have obvious vulnerabilities, and those are going to be exploited.”\n\nTrump is also ending the year by reminding Europe of his brazen desire, outlined in his first term and again shortly before his second inauguration, to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a reliable NATO ally whose per capita defense spending is among the highest of all member nations. On Saturday, he appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, a job that Landry said would focus on efforts to “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\n“This is shattering for a lot of the countries who thought that there was nothing safer than their bilateral relationship with the United States,” Stelzenmüller said.\n\nWhile openly threatening Denmark, the administration has worked to drive a wedge into the European Union by suggesting that countries would get better trade deals by splitting from the 27-nation bloc and engaging with the White House bilaterally.\n\n“At the end of the year, the fundamental question facing the Europeans is whether they think tactical victories are enough to win the strategic war, which is to maintain the transatlantic alliance that’s stood for eight decades,” said Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who earlier this month declared the “Pax Americana” to be dead, seemed open to the possibility, saying last week that it’s become “quite obvious” that Trump “cannot relate” to the EU and that “at least there are individual member states, including Germany first and foremost, of course, with which such cooperation can continue.”\n\nMerz led a failed push in Brussels last week for the EU to repurpose $200 billion in seized Russian assets in a loan to Ukraine when Belgium, Italy and others balked. But he ultimately succeeded with a back-up plan of sorts, as the EU approved a $90 billion loan for Ukraine aimed at sustaining its military on the battlefield for two more years. Three Trump-aligned leaders in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opted out of the loan but did not block its passage.\n\nWhile Trump quietly opposed the EU effort to shore up Ukraine’s war chest, Europeans have mostly supported his diplomatic efforts to end the war, pushing for stronger security guarantees to ensure Ukraine survives long-term. Finnish President Alexander Stubb appeared Sunday on Fox News to declare that Trump’s efforts have helped advance the talks “closer [to a peace deal] than at any time of this war,” a comment seemingly aimed at the proverbial audience of one and only loosely grounded in what most European leaders actually believe.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has accused The New York Times of being a national security threat in an unhinged Truth Social post.\n\n“The Failing New York Times, and their lies and purposeful misrepresentations, is a serious threat to the National Security of our Nation,” Trump wrote in a late-night social media meltdown.\n\n“Their Radical Left, Unhinged Behavior, writing FAKE Articles and Opinions in a never-ending way, must be dealt with and stopped. THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DJT.”\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Trump’s latest attack on the newspaper he has long derided as part of the “fake news” media.\n\nHowever, the president and the White House were triggered for days over a November report in the Times revealing that the 79-year-old president has drastically reduced his public appearances compared to his first term.\n\nTrump, who is on track to become the oldest sitting U.S. president to date, is also starting his days later on average and working shorter hours than he did during his first stint in the White House, the Times reported.\n\nLast week, the paper also published a detailed report examining Trump’s friendship with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, describing how the two “pursued women in a game of ego and dominance” in which “female bodies were currency.”\n\nIn one particularly damaging section, a mother who accompanied her 14-year-old daughter to a party at Mar-a-Lago with other young models claimed she was warned by Trump’s then-wife, Marla Maples: “Whatever you do, do not let her around any of these men, and especially my husband.” Maples denied making the remark to the Times.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Times during a Monday press conference, accusing the paper of insufficiently covering his plan to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe president ranted about the outlet while continuing to push a dubious claim that he had lowered the cost of prescription drugs by the mathematically impossible amount of up to “3,000 percent.”\n\n“A drug that sells for $10 in London is costing $130 in New York. We’re bringing it down to $20,” Trump said. “So we’re going down—you can do your own math, but it’s 2,000 percent, 3,000 percent. It’s pretty amazing. And, you know, the New York Times had a story about it, a small story, way in the back of the paper. It’s the single biggest thing to happen with respect to drugs probably in 50 years.\n\n“It’s the biggest thing ever to happen, and it’s barely covered in the New York Times because it’s a fake newspaper,” Trump added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted The New York Times for comment.",

Epstein\" addressed to Larry Nassar, the disgraced Team USA gymnastics doctor who sexually abused scores of women and girls, appeared to reference then-President Donald Trump and claimed the president loved \"young, nubile girls.\"\n\nThe note, apparently handwritten by Jeffrey Epstein while he was in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges, was postmarked on Aug. 13, 2019, three days after the disgraced financier was found dead by suicide in his cell.\n\nThe note, addressed to \"L.N.,\" seems to reference Epstein's intention to die by suicide.\n\n\"As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home,\" the note reads. \"Good luck! We share one thing … our love & caring for young ladies at the hope they’d reach their full potential.\"\n\nThough the note does not mention Trump by name, it does appear to reference him, as he was president at the time of Epstein's death.\n\n\"Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls,\" the note reads. \"When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J.

The images were released without context and have several faces redacted.\n\nTrump was also pictured with Epstein in photos that were taken down from the official website and eventually put back up following backlash.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe information contained in the files is separate from the thousands of documents given to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate.\n\nTrump's name appears multiple times in the emails, including when Epstein questioned the president's mental state and implied he \"knew about the girls\" being trafficked.",

    "fullText": "Graduate and professional students could soon find themselves with more limited student-loan options. Yale has a plan.\n\nThe Yale School of Public Health posted on LinkedIn last week that it will \"soon introduce a replacement loan option\" for student-loan borrowers who are affected by President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Grad PLUS program as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nGrad PLUS allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. Trump's legislation eliminated the program and implemented new borrowing caps: a $100,000 lifetime cap for graduate students and a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional students.\n\nYale said that its new program would \"offer comparable, if not more competitive, loan terms compared to previous Grad PLUS loans,\" adding that more details will be available soon. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to Yale, Bloomberg reported that other schools, such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, are also working to establish financing options for students pursuing advanced degrees, including working with private lenders for additional financing.\n\nEducation policy experts previously told Business Insider that limiting borrowing for advanced degrees could push students to either forgo their programs or turn to the private loan market, which could have riskier terms with higher interest rates.\n\nTrump's Department of Education is set to roll out the student-loan borrowing changes in July 2026. It will affect new students. Existing borrowers will be able to retain their financing options. The department is also introducing its new Repayment Assistance Plan in July, which is intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nSome advocates and Democratic lawmakers have previously expressed concern with the elimination of Grad PLUS and the new caps on borrowing for advanced degrees. The Department of Education proposed a new definition of \"professional,\" compiling a list of 10 programs, like medicine and dentistry, that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap.\n\nEarlier this month, over 140 bipartisan lawmakers signed onto a letter urging the department to revise the limits to include advanced nursing programs in the professional degree designation.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, told Business Insider that \"we expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",

End of story,” he continued.\n\nSimmons went on to say that it’s “nobody’s damn business who you support.”\n\n“Nowadays, people engage in, so, are you pro or — and my first question is ‘Who the f--- are you? Who are you?’\" Simmons said. “Since when does who I support or not support is the business of anyone except my conscience?”\n\nWhen asked to evaluate the MAGA movement within the Republican Party, Simmons said “some of it makes sense and some not.”\n\n“But literally, have a sense of humor,” he added. “Take a pill, shut up and stop worrying what your next-door neighbor believes or doesn’t believe. It’s their America, too.”\n\nSimmons, who was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors with KISS earlier this month, joined CNN on Capitol Hill, where he is pushing for the passage of the American Music Fairness Act. The bill, which was introduced in the House in January, would require radio corporations to pay artists royalties for playing their music over AM/FM airwaves.\n\nSimmons and music executives recently testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the legislation. In February, hundreds in the music industry — including Stevie Nicks, Celine Dion and Aerosmith — called on Congress in a letter to pass the bipartisan measure to fix what they characterized as an “inequity” that harms U.S. artists at home and abroad.\n\n“If you are against this bill, you are un-American,” Simmons said during his testimony.\n\nDuring the interview with CNN, Simmons responded directly to critics of the bill.\n\n“Radio stations last year made something like $14 billion,” he said in comments recorded on Dec. 9. “Artists, who you heard on the radio stations made zero. Your favorite artist, whether it’s a classic artist or a new artist, made zero. And that is inexcusable.”",

    "description": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.",
    "fullText": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.\n\nMonday’s panel discussed the aftermath of last week’s Turning Point USA event, where Ben Shapiro criticized Tucker Carlson for conducting interviews with white nationalist Nick Fuentes and for refusing to condemn Candace Owens for peddling conspiracy theories about TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Owens, who previously worked for Shapiro at The Daily Wire, has claimed that the Israeli government was involved in the murder.\n\nCarlson spoke moments later and offered a rebuttal. The next night, Steve Bannon spoke at the conference and likewise ripped Shapiro, as did Megyn Kelly. Vice President JD Vance also spoke at the event, where he told the crowd, “You don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”\n\nOn CNN NewsNight, Republican strategist Tim Parrish said there is no room for anti-Semitism and other forms og bigotry in the GOP and that Vance has adequately condemned such attacks, including his remarks about leaked Young Republican group chats that contained all manner of racial slurs and comments about Jews and “gas chambers.”\n\nVance told the group chat members to “grow up,” but he also criticized the “pearl clutching” by those who harshly condemned the messages and said that “kids do stupid things.”\n\n“You guys are mischaracterizing the statements that the vice president made,” Parrish said. “He absolutely came out and condemned and said that there is no place for any comments like that in the Republican Party.”\n\nAdam Mockler of MeidasTouch rejected the claim.\n\n“JD Vance said he’s gonna warn his kids so some ‘scumbag’ doesn’t leak a group chat in a similar way,” Mockler replied. “He was implying the person who leaked the group chat was a scumbag. JD Vance has had the farthest thing from moral clarity this entire time.”\n\nMockler then pivoted to Paul Ingrassia, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to be the acting general counsel of the U.S. General Services Administration. Leaked text messages from Ingrassia show that he said he has a “Nazi streak” and made racist remarks.\n\nHere is Mockler’s exchange with Parrish and Jennings:\n\nMOCKLER: And listen, do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know what– ok, so do you know what Paul Ingrassia said?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: That he has a Nazi streak. Oh, you’ve debated it. But has Trump fired him, or is he still a part of the administration?\n\nJENNINGS: I don’t know where he is right now.\n\nMOCKLER: He’s a part of the administration. And you know that. You’re lying right now. You know that he is a part of the administration. He is still there. And he said he has a “Nazi streak.” So you can sit there and play coy, but you are not having the clarity that you are talking about right now. Do you condemn Paul Ingrassia?\n\nJENNINGS: I certainly condemn anything–\n\nMOCKLER: Should Trump fire Paul Ingrassia?\n\nJENNINGS: –approximating having a Nazi streak.\n\nTwo days after Ingrassia’s texts were made public, Jennings said he agreed with the administration’s decision to withdraw Ingrassia’s nomination as head of the Office of Special Counsel. However, Trump appointed Ingrassia as acting general counsel at the General Services Administration three weeks later.\n\nHours before his appearance on NewsNight, Jennings said Vance will ultimately need to distance himself from conservatives who are “trafficking in hate.”\n\nThe post ‘You’re Lying Right Now’: CNN’s Scott Jennings Gets Cornered by Guest About Trump Official Who Claimed ‘Nazi Streak’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

How do you, what do you see that role entailing? What is your intention with that?\"TRUMP: \"Well, he called me. He viewed Louisiana, the Louisiana Purchase. He said, I'm governor of Louisiana. And he said, I would love I didn't call him. He called me. He's very proactive. He's a great guy. He's a deal guy. He's a deal maker type guy, and we need it for national protection. We need Greenland for national protection. They have a very small population and I don't know, they say Denmark, but Denmark has spent no money. They have no military protection. They say that Denmark was there 300 years ago or something with a boat. Well, we were there with boats too, I'm sure, so we'll have to work it all out. But he, he felt very strongly about it. We need it for national security. We need Greenland for national security, not for minerals. We have some. We have so many sites for minerals and oil and everything. We have more oil than any other country in the world. We need Greenland for national security. And if you take a look at Greenland, you look up and down the coast. You have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need it for national security. We have to have it. And he wanted to lead the charge. So we're making him Marco today, special envoy to Greenland. Greenland is a big deal.Trump named Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry on Sunday as his special envoy to Greenland, drawing renewed criticism from Denmark and Greenland over Washington's interest in the mineral-rich Arctic island.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",
