    "description": "While Stranger Things is wrapping up after an almost decade run on Netflix, that hasn't stopped the Upside Down from seeping into places most wouldn't expect. Microsoft Flight Simulator 24's collab with Stranger Things has arrived today on Steam, cloud, Xbox, and, despite initial pushback, PS5. The crossover is more than skins; it even features Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman) from the original cast as you help the citizens of Hawkins escape the encroaching darkness.\n\"Enter the world of Netflix’s Stranger Things to help Hawkins, a town under lockdown, heavy patrols, and supernatural threats,\" it reads on the official PlayStation Blog. \"And, if you’re ready to visit Hawkins, Indiana, even after the credits roll on the crew’s last strange adventure, you will be able to explore a highly detailed map and recreation of the town with more than 40 iconic locations made famous by the show.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets.\n\nMicrosoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines.\n\nOn a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's.\n\nNo one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\nSeveral Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation.\n\nMicrosoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals.\n\nThe bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer.\n\nMicrosoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company.\n\nThe new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60.\n\nMicrosoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI.\n\nEffective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites.\n\nSmall-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers.\n\nRationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities.\n\nBusiness Basic: $7 per user per month\n\nHere's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares:\n\nMicrosoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRemaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase.\n\nSegments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing.\n\nThe board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026.\n\nIt's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins.\n\nIn the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI.\n\nAll sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand.\n\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\n\nWindows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’\n\nMichael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet\n\nIn the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch.\n\nThe updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption.\n\nPenetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats.\n\nAzure AI usage (workload and usage mix).\n\nBefore the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates.\n\nThe quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore.\n\nThat's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.\nHe told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.\nThe 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud.",
