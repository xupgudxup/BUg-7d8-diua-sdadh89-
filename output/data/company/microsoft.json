    "description": "One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.\n\"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games,\" Booty said to Variety. \"I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds.",

It's a \"wall-to-wall\" guild built to protect employees from AI while negotiating for ample benefits, such as remote work, and Microsoft appears to have recognized the studio's union.\nIn a press release on the CWA's website, id Software's 165-person union will join the CWA Local 6215 division in Richardson, Texas. Producer Andrew Willis noted how important it is for workers to fight back against the injustices facing the games industry at the moment.\n\"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,\" Willis said.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update for December is here, and Windows users should ensure their machines are updated as soon as possible to fix three zero-day vulnerabilities. These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch.\n\nAs reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.\n\nPatch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time.\n\nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions.\n\nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed:\n\nCVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings.\n\nCVE-2025-54100 - PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This bug could cause scripts embedded in a webpage to be executed when retrieved using Invoke-WebRequest.\n\nCVE-2025-62221 has been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).

    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets.\n\nMicrosoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines.\n\nOn a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's.\n\nNo one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\nSeveral Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation.\n\nMicrosoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals.\n\nThe bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer.\n\nMicrosoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company.\n\nThe new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60.\n\nMicrosoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI.\n\nEffective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites.\n\nSmall-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers.\n\nRationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities.\n\nBusiness Basic: $7 per user per month\n\nHere's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares:\n\nMicrosoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRemaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase.\n\nSegments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing.\n\nThe board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026.\n\nIt's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins.\n\nIn the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI.\n\nAll sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand.\n\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\n\nWindows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’\n\nMichael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet\n\nIn the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch.\n\nThe updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption.\n\nPenetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats.\n\nAzure AI usage (workload and usage mix).\n\nBefore the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates.\n\nThe quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore.\n\nThat's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.",

    "description": "Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a \"whole avalanche\" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.\nHe told XDA-Developers that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.\nThe 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud.",
