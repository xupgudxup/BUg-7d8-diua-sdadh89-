    "description": "Four tech professionals, from an early career engineer to a former senior director of GenAI at Meta, said getting your hands dirty was important for breaking into the AI industry.",
    "fullText": "As the AI revolution continues to disrupt white collar jobs, many of us are looking for ways to get ahead.\n\nAs part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs.\n\nThese conversations covered a variety of topics, from whether you need a Ph.D. to break into the field to how to earn big as an AI contractor.\n\nBut one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door.\n\nThey didn't view AI as something that can be mastered from a textbook or in a lecture hall. Instead, play around with AI, like an infant tinkering with a new toy, or \"get your hands dirty,\" to borrow a phrase from a couple of the techies I interviewed.\n\nBut what does that look like in practice? Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers.\n\nWhen Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded.\n\nLeung joined the Duplex team in 2017. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job.\n\nLeveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI.\n\nLeung witnessed Google Duplex's public launch in 2018, before leaving Google in 2019 to join a financial sciences company. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career.\n\nAt the time of his interview with Business Insider, Leung said the barrier to getting into AI was lower than ever, and encouraged people to apply LLMs to real business problems. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate.\n\nIf there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs.\n\nSophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager.\n\nThe tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram.\n\nShe started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before.\n\nThat July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role.\n\nSun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Having good grades is one thing, she said, but building a product that demonstrates your abilities is another, she said.\n\nWhen OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change.\n\nHe started his career in traditional software engineering at Snap Inc. and then ZipRecruiter, but became convinced he needed to build AI skills.\n\nShakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés.\n\nIn February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week.\n\nShakib decided not to go back to a full-time traditional software engineering job. He said he thought focusing on building AI skills before the market gets crowded was the right bet for him.\n\nWhile being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. As a full-time AI contractor, he can spread out his hours as he pleases, he added.\n\nShakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling.\n\nAlthough Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI.\n\nAs the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said.\n\nOther potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities.\n\nStarting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called \"Humans of AI,\" where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits. This gave her more professional visibility than her research alone could.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into AI? Contact this reporter at ccheong@businessinsider.com",

    "description": "Rishab Jolly, a senior PM at Microsoft, uses AI tools to help him draft documents for work, and to speed up research for his podcasting hobby.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, 37, a senior program manager at Microsoft, based in Washington. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI landed a job at Microsoft as a program manager in 2017, after moving to the US for my MBA.\n\nI'm now a senior PM and find my role very fulfilling. My role involves developing ideas for products and features that enhance the customer experience, but also drafting plans that take the product from development to shipping to the customer. PMs are like the glue that brings different teams, across engineering, marketing, and business, together to work on each project.\n\nAs AI tools have become more prevalent, I've felt excited about the technology's potential to help me in my role. I consider myself an early adopter who's been upskilling to make sure I have AI as a new tool in my toolbox.\n\nHere are the ways AI helps me, both in my job and personal life, that are relatively easy to replicate.\n\nI studied computer science engineering for my bachelor's degree in India, where I'm from, before moving to the US in 2015 for my MBA. I also worked as a software engineer in India for four years, at companies using AI and machine learning in some form, before LLMs arrived on the scene. I wouldn't have called myself an AI expert, but I understood how the technology worked.\n\nAs AI tools have become more commonplace, I've used them to make my work faster and easier.\n\nPMs like me spend a huge amount of time in meetings. When I first joined Microsoft, I compiled notes manually to help me understand what I needed to action afterward. Now, I use can use AI tools for note-taking, which has given me back a lot of time to focus on more meaningful work, like strategic thinking and prioritization.\n\nPart of my job as a PM is to write documents that provide clarity to engineering teams about our goals and priorities. AI tools can help reduce the time spent on an initial draft. I then review, edit, and shape the AI-generated content myself, applying my judgment and experience before sharing the document with the team.\n\nAt work, I use the tools available at Microsoft, but in my personal life, I like experimenting and getting my hands dirty with a wide range of tools, from ChatGPT and Perplexity to Gemini.\n\nI started a podcast called \"Curious Souls\" in 2022 with my wife, who also works in tech, where we talk about our passion for product management, AI, fitness, and other topics with guest speakers. It's my hobby.\n\nResearching topics by asking PMs what they wanted to hear about and coming up with ideas for guests was very time-consuming.\n\nNow, I can speed up the process by prompting LLMs to search Reddit for hot topics that PMs are talking about and ask the chatbot to generate a script about the chosen topic. I can even generate an audio clip of the script to listen to while driving to the gym and ponder on how the podcast might sound if I used the script.\n\nI still dedicate between four and five hours each weekend to the podcast, but with AI, I'm able to accomplish much \n\nExperimenting with AI in personal projects has helped me understand where AI is helpful and where it isn't. For example, when I was using AI to generate podcast scripts, I found that it sometimes generated inaccurate outputs, like placeholder links that don't actually exist, so I usually treat AI output as a starting point and make sure to check it.\n\nAs a result, I'm more intentional when I use AI at work, knowing when to rely on automation and when human judgment is essential. I think it's worth experimenting with AI outside of work on low-risk projects, like planning hobbies or trips, before applying similar techniques professionally.\n\nInstead of being fearful of AI, I've decided to embrace it. In the future, I think PMs will be expected to know how to use AI to do things faster.\n\nEven with AI, I think the crux of the PM role will remain the same: being empathetic to customers and solving their problems. AI will make us more capable of solving those issues, and it can give us suggestions for how to approach issues, but the judgment calls will always be made by humans. It won't replace us, but it will be an essential tool to make our lives easier.\n\nMy advice to PMs is to embrace AI and get your hands dirty by experimenting with it, not just in your job, but in daily life. There's no way around it, and the sooner you start doing it, the faster you'll see benefits.\n\nDo you have a story to share about how you use AI at work?

    "description": "Rishab Jolly moved to the US to get his MBA after starting his engineering career in India. He was hired at Microsoft in 2017 as a product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, a 37-year-old senior product manager at Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington. Business Insider has verified Jolly's employment history with documentation. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBefore moving to the US in 2015, I studied engineering and computer science in India, where I worked as both a software quality tester and an engineer.\n\nI was always interested in the business side of technology, so I left my job in India to pursue an MBA at the University of Arizona. My goal was to gain business acumen to complement my engineering background. I saw firsthand how much innovation takes place in the US and how many opportunities exist to work on cutting-edge products, which inspired me to build my career here.\n\nOne of the most valuable parts of the MBA program was its partnerships with Big Tech companies. As part of the curriculum, representatives from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google brought projects to campus.\n\nStudents formed teams, worked on deliverables, and were graded by company representatives. In 2016, I was team lead on a Microsoft project, and we did an excellent job. That gave me a chance to network and to demonstrate my skills to an actual Microsoft product manager.\n\nI applied to about 200 jobs, sending the same generic résumé without referrals. I received only three calls back and passed two interviews, but both offers were subsequently rescinded: one company considered my visa too risky without a STEM extension, and another cited budgetary reasons.\n\nI needed to secure a job within 60-90 days after graduation, or I would be forced to return to India. I ran out of money, asked a friend if I could crash on their couch, and felt a constant sense of anxiety.\n\nDuring that time, I stayed in touch with the Microsoft contact I'd met through my MBA project. When an opening came up, I asked if he would refer me.\n\nHe agreed, and I rewrote my résumé to match the specific role. The hiring manager liked my application, called me in, and I got a shot. That referral and tailoring my résumé made all the difference.\n\nI was hired by Microsoft in July 2017 and started as a product manager. I became a senior product manager in 2021.\n\nFirst, you have to get the interview, and second, you have to pass it. For the first step, referrals are critical. Big Tech companies receive tens of thousands of résumés every month. A referral can push yours to the top of the stack.\n\nTo prepare for interviews, I relied heavily on mock interviews. I reached out to peers who had been in the same boat and asked them to test me. They helped me refine my storytelling, practice answering metrics-driven questions, and pinpoint areas for improvement.\n\nWhen I finally interviewed at Microsoft, the feedback I received was that my stories were authentic and clearly based on real experiences. That authenticity resonated far more than rehearsed answers pulled from the internet.\n\nIn today's tech world, showcasing your skills outside work or school, whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through personal projects, demonstrates passion and initiative.\n\nI started posting more consistently on LinkedIn during the pandemic. I shared lessons from my career, thoughts on product management, and observations about the industry. I wasn't trying to \"build a following,\" I just focused on topics that genuinely resonated with me.\n\nOver time, those posts resonated with others, and a community naturally formed around them. The growth happened gradually and organically, simply because people connected with the ideas and conversations.\n\nRecruiters notice when you go beyond the curriculum to learn new tools or contribute to open-source projects. In a fast-changing industry where AI and new technologies emerge every six months, demonstrating your ability to adapt and self-learn is as important as the content of your résumé.\n\nWhile a small percentage of jobs may prefer an MBA, I know successful product managers who came from accounting, English literature, or completely different areas. Microsoft values diverse backgrounds because innovation thrives when teams bring fresh perspectives.\n\nEven with this knowledge, I would still pursue an MBA because it was not just about academics; it was also about gaining practical experience. It provided me with exposure to new perspectives, helped me transition into product management, and connected me with mentors and peers who have shaped my career in meaningful ways.\n\nI don't think an MBA is mandatory for everyone. It depends on your goals and whether you're looking for a career pivot, a network, or structured learning.\n\nVisa restrictions, financial pressure, and cultural adjustments can make the experience stressful. I had moments when I felt defeated, but staying focused and working smart eventually brought everything together.\n\nAfter over eight years at Microsoft, I plan to continue contributing to the technology and innovation ecosystem. I'm exploring the appropriate pathways that align with my career goals, but nothing is finalized at this time. My focus is on the work itself and continuing to grow professionally.\n\nMy advice to anyone following a similar path is straightforward: network strategically, prepare thoroughly, stay authentic, and continually build your skills and presence. Things may look uncertain now, but persistence and the right relationships can open doors you didn't think were possible.",

    "title": "'Fragmented' Microsoft tools undercut efficiency at Amazon and Whole Foods, internal Deloitte review found",
    "description": "Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps remained disconnected from Amazon, leading to inefficiencies and security concerns, a Deloitte review found.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than eight years since Amazon bought Whole Foods, but the two companies still haven't aligned their setup for the Microsoft software their employees use.\n\nThat disconnect was flagged in an 8-week Deloitte review of Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps earlier this year, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nDeloitte found that Whole Foods relies on \"fragmented\" Microsoft toolsets, has loose security and data-retention practices, and employs a complex user-management setup — all of which contribute to inefficiencies and lower productivity when working with Amazon employees.\n\nThe consulting firm recommended a 24-month integration plan that would first move Whole Foods' corporate employees onto Amazon's backend system, followed by its frontline workers. The phased approach would ensure a \"smooth transition for users and minimal disruption to business processes,\" while generating cost savings, the document said.\n\nThe review, completed in May, highlights Amazon's ongoing challenges in integrating Whole Foods. Since acquiring the chain in 2017, the company has struggled to scale the business and integrate operations, resulting in frequent reorganizations and shifting strategic priorities.\n\nNow, under new grocery chief Jason Buechel, Amazon is making a renewed push to knit Whole Foods more closely with its Amazon Fresh division. Buechel, who is both Whole Foods' CEO and Amazon's VP of grocery, has been championing a unified \"One Grocery\" strategy and a \"flying formation\" model aimed at bringing the two organizations into tighter alignment.\n\nIt also underscores Amazon's dependence on cloud rival Microsoft for core productivity software such as word processing and spreadsheets. In 2023, Amazon committed to spending at least $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365, Business Insider previously reported. The company has long struggled to develop its own business applications and, earlier this year, formally adopted Zoom in place of its Chime meeting app.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson, Jamie Forrest, told Business Insider that Amazon has a \"successful and growing\" grocery business with more than 150 million customers. Over the years, the company has made changes to \"simplify ways of working and better collaborate across teams,\" Forrest added.\n\n\"We're bringing our corporate grocery teams closer together with a consistent employee experience, including aligning to the same technology systems and tools, to make it easier to collaborate and innovate on behalf of our customers,\" Forrest said in a statement.\n\nThe Deloitte team collaborated with Whole Foods employees to evaluate the current landscape and develop a future roadmap for the company's use of Microsoft 365.\n\nUltimately, Deloitte identified six \"key themes\" that must be addressed to streamline the business, including:\n\nDeloitte recommended a phased integration plan that first migrates Whole Foods' corporate staff to Amazon's backend technology, followed by frontline workers.\n\nUnder the plan, corporate workers would transition early to Amazon's tenant for email and OneDrive, while more complex systems, such as SharePoint and Teams, would shift gradually to allow for testing and re-permissioning involving both Whole Foods and Amazon identities. All workloads would eventually be consolidated under Amazon, enabling Whole Foods to cut duplicative licensing costs and align with Amazon's security standards.\n\n\"As applications and services transition, they will seamlessly integrate under a unified tenant, fostering streamlined interactions between WFM and Amazon employees,\" the document stated. \"Aligning with Amazon's security protocols and guidelines will significantly enhance WFM's organizational security posture, ensuring adherence to superior industry standards.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Amazon and Whole Foods adopted the full set of recommendations. But the gradual shift that Deloitte recommended mirrors Amazon's broader workforce consolidation effort with Whole Foods.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, Amazon began moving Whole Foods' corporate employees onto its own systems earlier this year. Now, under an internal project codenamed \"Cremini,\" Amazon plans to absorb the entire 100,000-plus workforce of Whole Foods, including frontline employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI's CEO, has described using AI for guidance on life decisions as \"something that the world needs.\"",
    "fullText": "The CEO of Microsoft AI says chatbots are a good way to offload emotions and \"detoxify ourselves.\"\n\nAppearing on an episode of Mayim Bialik's \"Breakdown\" podcast, which was released on December 16, Mustafa Suleyman said companionship and support have become some of AI's most popular use cases.\n\nPeople are using AI chatbots for everything from navigating breakups to solving disagreements with family members, he said.\n\n\"That's not therapy,\" Suleyman said. \"But because these models were designed to be nonjudgmental, nondirectional, and with nonviolent communication as their primary method, which is to be even-handed, have reflective listening, to be empathetic, to be respectful, it turned out to be something that the world needs.\"\n\nThe upside of this, he said, is \"this is a way to spread kindness and love and to detoxify ourselves so that we can show up in the best way that we possible can in the real world, with the humans that we love.\"\n\nSuleyman cofounded DeepMind in 2010. The company was acquired by Google in 2014.\n\nOn the podcast, he said people need a space to \"ask a stupid question, repeatedly, in a private way, without feeling embarrassed.\"\n\nOver time, he said, chatbots can make people \"feel seen and understood\" in a way that many other humans can't, outside of partners or close friends.\n\nNot everyone in tech, however, is enthusiastic about chatbots being used as therapy stand-ins. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is one of those voices. In August 2025, he expressed his discomfort over people relying on chatbots to make major life choices.\n\n\"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions,\" Altman wrote on X. \"Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy.\"\n\nIn July 2025, while appearing on \"This Past Weekend with Theo Von,\" Altman also flagged the potential legal risks of offloading onto a robot. He said that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.\n\nMental health professionals have voiced concerns over the rise of ChatGPT therapy, too. Speaking to Business Insider senior health reporter Julia Pugachevsky in March 2025, two therapists said that relying on AI chatbots for emotional support could exacerbate loneliness and make people dependent on seeking reassurance.\n\nSuleyman acknowledged some of those downsides on the podcast, saying there is \"definitely a dependency risk,\" and that chatbots can sometimes be overly flattering or \"sycophantic.\"\n\nSuleyman is not the sole tech voice who sees AI's therapeutic potential. In a May 2025 interview with the Stratechery newsletter, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he believed everyone should have a therapist.\n\n\"For people who don't have a person who's a therapist,\" Zuckerberg said, \"I think everyone will have an AI.\"",

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Bill Gates identifies the biggest burden being passed on to his children after seeing his daughter harassed online",
    "description": "Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said he had been naive to assume that “when we made information available, that people would want correct information.”",
    "fullText": "Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning senior reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia.\n\nThere are many problems billionaire tech tycoon Bill Gates is hoping to help solve: eradicating polio, water sanitization, and agricultural development to name a few. But one frontier he worries is being passed on to future generations is misinformation.\n\nMisinformation is a problem, the Microsoft cofounder said, that we are “handing to the younger generation.”\n\nSpeaking to CNBC Make It, Gates, worth $118 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said he had been naive to assume that “when we made information available, that people would want correct information.”\n\nA high-profile figure himself, Gates has seen scrutiny extend to his family. His daughter Phoebe, in particular, has struggled with being harassed online.\n\n“Hearing my daughter talk about how she’d been harassed online, and how her friends experienced that quite a bit, brought that into focus in a way that I hadn’t thought about before,” Gates—a father of three—continued.\n\nGates’ youngest daughter—co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia—has previously spoken about misconceptions surrounding her family and relationships, including being “memed for being in an interracial relationship.”\n\nAn internet meme is an image or video, usually intended to be humorous, that is spread online.\n\nDespite being aware of how misinformation is spreading online, Gates said he can understand why certain audiences flock to platforms that reflect their views—a phenomenon known as confirmation bias.\n\n“We have context where we want correct information, like hopefully when we want medical advice,” Gates said. “But then we kind of like, in our community and enclave, have these shared views that kind of pull us together.”\n\nHe explained: “Even I will wallow. Let’s say there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s some article online criticizing him a little bit. I’m like, ‘Oh, that’s such a good critique, [and] I enjoyed reading it, even if it was exaggerated.’”\n\nGates’ probing questions about how to control the spread of incorrect information online may be at odds with the take of fellow billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nGates said in the interview: “We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules, and then if you have rules, what is it? Is it some AI that encodes those rules? You have billions in activity, and if you catch it a day later the harm is done.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time Gates has proposed the emerging technology as a tool against misinformation and deepfakes (images and videos which are incredibly realistic but are not authentic).\n\nIn a blog post on his website, GatesNotes, in July 2023, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation cofounder wrote: “This will be a cyclical process: Someone finds a way to detect fakery, someone else figures out how to counter it, someone else develops counter-countermeasures, and so on.\n\n“It won’t be a perfect success, but we won’t be helpless either.”\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of X—the platform previously known as Twitter—is a free-speech absolutist who is unlikely to appreciate the notion of rules being placed on what he, or others, can say.\n\nMusk believes freedom of speech is the “bedrock of democracy” and has vowed to battle apparent censorship of his platform.\n\nThat being said, a debate over how to control misinformation wouldn’t be the first time the views of Musk and Gates have been at odds. In July 2024, for example, Musk threatened Gates would be “obliterated” for apparently holding a bearish position on Tesla stock. Fortune could not confirm whether Gates still owns a short position on the EV maker.\n\nLikewise, Gates has said his management style is better than that of Musk—a boss he believes may push “too hard.” Meanwhile, Musk has claimed Gates doesn’t understand artificial intelligence, saying his insight on the topic is “limited.”\n\nMore recently, the tech titans have been at loggerheads over Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE.) In January 2025, Gates said he hoped some of the foreign aid and personnel cuts enacted by DOGE would be rolled back: “Elon I think said ‘Yeah, we made a mistake, we went overboard,’ but … what is the equilibrium? How many of those people can be kept so we can continue to save tens of millions of lives?” Gates also accused Musk of some “insane” political interference in 2025.\n\nIn November, Musk revived the bad blood between the pair, writing on X that if Gates hadn’t closed out his alleged “crazy short position” against Tesla, “he had better do so soon.”\n\nIt seems misinformation may just be another of many topics on which the billionaires will have to agree to disagree.\n\nA version of this article was first published on September 5, 2024.",

    "title": "I'm an ex-Clinton strategist turned CEO. I don't micromanage and love Chinese food and brain games — here's a day in my life.",
    "description": "Mark Penn is a former Microsoft exec and was the White House pollster to Bill Clinton. He's now the CEO of marketing company Stagwell.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mark Penn, the 71-year-old CEO and Chairman of Stagwell, based in Miami Beach. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy career spans 40 years in market research, advertising, public relations, polling, and consulting.\n\nBefore founding Stagwell, a global marketing and communications company, I served as an executive vice president and chief strategy officer at Microsoft.\n\nI'm also the cofounder and CEO of Penn Schoen Berland, a market research firm that I built and sold to WPP, a British multinational communications company.\n\nFor six years, I served as the White House pollster to President Bill Clinton and was the chief strategist for his 1996 reelection campaign. I later served as chief strategist to Hillary Clinton throughout her Senate campaigns and 2008 presidential bid.\n\nAt WPP, I saw the ins and outs of big marketing and decided it wasn't people-oriented enough. I decided to establish a new company to address the problems I observed.\n\nI was still at Microsoft, and I had been promoted to head all the advertising. The chief strategy officer, Steve Ballmer, came to me and said, \"You know, that idea you've had? I like that idea, and I'll be your core investor.\"\n\nOn September 15, 2015, we started Stagwell with a single employee in a half-rented office.\n\nHere's what a typical day looks like 10 years later with a team of 13,000 employees worldwide.\n\nSeveral people on my team are up for 4 a.m., but not me. I sleep until at least 7 or 7:30 a.m.\n\nI'm, unfortunately, the type of person who picks up my phone as soon as I wake up. I don't spend the whole day on the phone, but I do like to check in periodically to see what's going on.\n\nI'm on the phone between 7 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. I'm watching a bit of TV to catch up on the news and shoot out a couple of emails.\n\nI don't drink coffee, I skip breakfast, and I don't have a morning exercise routine. I have a core lounging period, then I shower at 8:30 a.m. and get dressed.\n\nMy goal is to be in the office exactly at 9 a.m., five days a week.\n\nI go into the office depending on which city I'm in, as I visit our offices in Miami Beach, Washington, D.C., and New York. I only work remotely if I get a little behind during the day.\n\nWhen I arrive at the office, I have a lot of meetings, but sometimes I also have interviews and TV appearances.\n\nI've organized the business by corporate leadership and its divisions. I want everyone to have a clear understanding of what's happening in the company. I like my team to know and work with each other, even if they're no longer in the same place.\n\nComing out of Microsoft, I saw how Steve Ballmer had a huge team under him, but he would always manage to leave at 5:30 p.m. The answer was that he planned out his time well.\n\nMy chief of staff manages my schedule and who has access to it, and then there are one or two other administrative staff behind them — they sort things out once or twice a week.\n\nGenerally, I order a Postmates lunch. I'm a big fan of steamed Chinese food, so I typically order steamed dishes with vegetables and hot-and-sour soup, and sometimes a sushi and sashimi combo.\n\nI prefer not to eat during meetings; it's essential to remain focused on the people I'm meeting with. I squeeze in lunch between meetings.\n\nAround 12:30 p.m., I schedule a half-hour catch-up, which could be spent with HR, marketing, a client meeting, or an ad hoc meeting for something that has come up.\n\nThere's no breathing room, pretty much from 12:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., with lots of meetings. There are many PowerPoint presentations.\n\nI used to do presidential races, so that was constant, 'Oh my god, the candidate did what?' situations. We don't get as much derailment at Stagwell.\n\nSometimes things run long, sometimes things break down in some way, but it's pretty unusual.\n\nI wish I knew the secret to maintaining high energy consistently. I drink sugar-free Snapple and Diet Coke; I don't drink much coffee or caffeine. I have a naturally evenly balanced level of energy.\n\nThe days on the road are more interesting than the days in the office, whether that means visiting an office, holding a town hall, meeting a combination of clients, or attending a board meeting.\n\nMy day is structured around meetings with relevant stakeholders, where I present either their current progress or their proposed plans, and gather feedback on their accomplishments and approval for their future initiatives.\n\nAll other stakeholders are always present, so that if they want to comment, they have the opportunity to do so immediately, and also so that everyone is informed about what's going on.\n\nWhen people are siloed too much and don't understand each other, they'll never be able to collaborate or build a great culture.\n\nWhen I get home from the office, I usually have dinner with my wife. We have four kids, but they're all older now. For dinner, I like a lot of protein, a vegetable, and a baked potato.\n\nAfter dinner, I might catch up on the news. My wife tends to go to sleep a little earlier than I do, around 10 p.m., and I might spend some time catching up on the news, Netflix, or other things.\n\nI read a lot of news and information, but I also enjoy watching science fiction shows. I can get hooked on a series and stay up to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. — that can be disastrous.\n\nThe last series I got hooked on was Lioness on Prime Video. I'm watching the final episode of Foundation on Apple TV, which has been the most interesting show of the season.\n\nBefore I go to bed, I'll make sure I'm pretty covered on the news.\n\nI like playing Neural Bridge when I'm having trouble falling asleep.\n\nI avoid working on weekends unless there's an emergency or crisis. I respect my employees' time. Occasionally, there's some Sunday night work, but my goal is to ensure every position is filled with someone who's really effective at what they do, let them do their job, and have them report. I don't believe in micromanaging people.\n\nI encourage my team to shoot for the stars, and in a sense, they come back with a big, ambitious plan. I'd rather you reach 90% of an ambitious plan than 100% of an unambitious one.",

Bethesda's space-based game will receive an additional story DLC, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of Grand Theft Auto 6 played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.\nAccording to Windows Central, Bethesda \"felt more comfortable\" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a \"busy holiday period\" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.",

    "description": "Mustafa Suleyman says staying at the AI frontier will cost \"hundreds of billions\" over the next five to 10 years.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft AI CEO says there's a huge price to pay for staying in the AI game.\n\nMustafa Suleyman said in an episode of the \"Moonshots with Peter Diamandis\" podcast published Wednesday that it's going to cost \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" to compete at the frontier of AI over the next five to 10 years.\n\n\"Not to mention the prices that we're paying for individual researchers or members of technical staff,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman compared Microsoft to a \"modern construction company,\" where hundreds of thousands of workers are building gigawatts of CPUs and AI accelerators.\n\nThe scale of investment that is required is huge, and \"clearly there's a structural advantage by being inside a big company,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft, which has a market capitalization of $3.54 trillion, brought in $77.7 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in September, surpassing analysts' estimates.\n\nSuleyman said his mission is to make Microsoft \"self-sufficient\" in developing its frontier models and to build \"an absolutely world-class superintelligence team.\"\n\n\"We're absolutely pushing for the frontier,\" Suleyman said. \"We want to build the best superintelligence and the safest superintelligence models in the world.\"\n\nSuleyman said last month that his team is \"trying to build a humanist superintelligence\" — one that is aligned with human interest.\n\nWith the high cost required to keep up with AI, Suleyman said on the podcast that \"it's hard to say\" if startups could compete with Big Tech.\n\n\"The ambiguity is what's driving the frothiness of the valuations,\" he said. \"If suddenly we do have an intelligence explosion, then lots of people can get there simultaneously.\"\n\nMicrosoft is one of several tech giants chasing artificial general intelligence, or superintelligence, and executives across the industry have been blunt about how expensive that pursuit will be.\n\nArtificial general intelligence, or AGI, refers to AI systems that can match human intelligence across most tasks. Superintelligence goes a step further — systems that surpass human abilities.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in September he'd rather risk \"misspending a couple of hundred billion\" than fall behind in superintelligence.\n\nIf superintelligence arrives earlier than expected and a company moves too slowly, it'll be \"out of position on what I think is going to be the most important technology that enables the most new products and innovation and value creation and history,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBillions of dollars have also been poured into AI data centers. In recent months, Big Tech firms like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon have ramped up spending on cloud and compute infrastructure to train and run frontier models.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella views AI as an existential threat, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and a chance to cement his legacy at the top of the tech industry.\n\nThe mission is both personal and professional for the Nadella, who is pushing the company to rethink how it operates at every level. That's according to internal Microsoft documents obtained by Business Insider, and interviews with leaders, managers, and other employees at the software giant.\n\nSweeping organizational shifts include high-profile executive changes and mandates for teams to work faster and leaner — all designed to consolidate power around AI leaders and radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.\n\n\"Satya is pushing on intensity and urgency,\" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider. That's putting pressure on some Microsoft veterans to decide whether they want to stay and commit to the mountain of work it's going to take to complete Nadella's AI revolution.\n\n\"You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,\" this executive added.\n\nNadella is having conversations with executives to sign on for the transformation, or leave, people familiar with the matter said. Many of these people asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, although one top executive spoke openly with Business Insider about the CEO's overhaul and Microsoft's AI future.\n\nNadella this year appointed a new CEO of Microsoft's commercial business to free up time to focus on the technical work necessary for his AI ambitions.\n\nAccording to an internal memo, Nadella also started a weekly AI accelerator meeting and corresponding Teams channel to speed the pace of AI work and get more ideas from across the company.\n\nExecutives do not present in these new meetings. Instead, lower-level technical employees are encouraged to speak and share what they're seeing from the AI trenches. This is designed to avoid top-down AI leadership, and is intentionally a bit messy and chaotic, according to people familiar with the new approach.\n\nOther major executive changes are looming. Three Microsoft executives told Business Insider that longtime Office and Windows boss Rajesh Jha has been mulling retirement. Insiders are also chattering about the possibility that Charlie Bell, who runs Microsoft cybersecurity, could retire.\n\nMicrosoft's spokesman Frank Shaw said the company does not expect any changes in the short term to its senior leadership team, of which Bell and Jha are both members.\n\nMicrosoft recently promoted Judson Althoff, its longtime sales chief, to an expanded role as CEO of the company's commercial business.\n\nAlthoff's promotion is intended to give Nadella and the company's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described this moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nNadella has shifted to saying the company is in the \"middle innings\" rather than the \"early innings\" of AI, a cricket term, and started saying he wants to see the game through, one of the people said.\n\n\"This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work — across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation — to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nPractically, that's meant Althoff is spending more time as the face of Microsoft at events such as the recent Ignite conference, the first one in Nadella's tenure when the company CEO didn't deliver the keynote.\n\nOne executive told Business Insider the move seems to be paying off so far by giving Nadella \"extra bandwidth to really lead the company in learning, leveraging, and building AI.\"\n\n\"Satya is 100% engaged with leading the company to learn and embrace AI,\" this person said. \"The Judson move was brilliant. It actually allows Satya more time to advance the company in its AI journey. Satya spends a good amount of time in meetings you could characterize as AI learning, product, and engineering.\"\n\nNadella recently announced new marching orders for executives in another Teams channel, this one exclusively for Microsoft corporate vice presidents and above. The CEO said the company is at a turning point at least as significant as the shift to cloud computing and needs to completely rethink its business model.\n\n\"We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,\" Nadella wrote, referring to Individual Contributors, someone who is focused on technical work rather than managing people.\n\n\"I chuckle a bit each time someone sends me a note about talking to a friend at an AI start-up, about how differently they're working, how agile, focused, fast they are,\" the CEO added. \"The reality is that this work is also happening right here at Microsoft under our noses! It's our jobs as leaders to seek this out, empower it, cultivate it, and learn from our own early in career talent who are reinventing the new production function!!\"\n\nAsha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI product president, who joined in 2024, said the company has shifted its operations dramatically in her short tenure. Nadella's new \"production function\" is about using AI to radically change how the company creates, builds, and delivers products and services.\n\nWhen she joined, the AI industry would crank out a big new foundation model roughly every six months. Then, releases happened every six weeks. Today, AI is changing so quickly that it's forcing Microsoft to rethink not just its products but the entire way software is made, Sharma said in an interview arranged by the company.\n\nFor decades, software development has worked like an assembly line. You take a set of inputs — people, time, resources — and transform them into output. Scaling production required scaling those inputs.\n\n\"AI breaks that relationship,\" she said.\n\nAI agents, data, and intelligence now act as a new type of scalable unit that can generate software, insights, and decisions without a corresponding increase in engineering hours or budget. That means the marginal cost of creating something new drops dramatically, Sharma explained, and teams can now spend more on \"judgment, taste, and problem-solving.\"\n\nWith so much changing, it's natural that leadership evolves — and Microsoft insiders expect more changes at the top.\n\nJha, a veteran executive who oversees famous Microsoft products such as Office and Windows, has been mulling retirement, according to three executives who spoke to Business Insider.\n\nStill, one of these executives noted that Jha has a newfound excitement about the company's AI potential, so he could stick around for Nadella's new intense era.\n\nIf Jha leaves, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky might succeed him, these executives said. Roslansky has been running LinkedIn since 2020 and Microsoft recently expanded Roslansky's role to include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot application, according to an internal announcement from Nadella in June.\n\nRoslansky started reporting to Jha for his new duties as executive vice president of Office, and to Nadella in his capacity as LinkedIn CEO, according to organizational charts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nCharles Lamanna, president of the business and industry Copilot group responsible for building AI tools like low-code applications, also moved to report to Jha at the time, and is taking on a bigger profile within the company, the people said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Warren Buffett Says Buy This Vanguard Index Fund -- It Could Turn $400 Per Month Into $835,000 With Help From Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft",
    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "fullText": "Outside the lavish event, workers called out the ‘greed’ in the industry that has left games ‘being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money’\n\nIt’s the night of the 2025 Game Awards, a major industry event where the best games of the year are crowned and major publishers reveal forthcoming projects. In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’ Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.\n\nThe protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”\n\nWebster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames was accused of union-busting after firing more than 30 staff (the studio denies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidly injected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.\n\n“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awards costs more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”\n\nFor the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”\n\nFor those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”\n\nThere’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.\n\n“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.",

    "fullText": "The talent wars continue to rage across Silicon Valley as companies vie for the best and brightest minds in AI. There is, however, one major AI company that says it is not giving in to pressure.\n\nMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said on Bloomberg Podcasts that he doesn't plan to compete with tech giants like Meta by offering top dollar for talent.\n\n\"I don't think anyone's matching those things,\" Suleyman said of the $100 million signing bonuses Meta has been offering engineers, and the $250 million packages it's been using to lure top AI researchers.\n\n\"I think that Zuck's taken a particular approach that involves sort of hiring a lot of individuals rather than maybe creating a team, and I don't really think that's the right approach,\" he said.\n\nSuleyman said he was \"very selective\" about new hires when he previously worked at DeepMind. At Microsoft, he said he has hired \"incrementally,\" prioritizing candidates who aligned with the team's culture and had the right skills, and let go of those who did not.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the top ranks of AI talent are commanding pay packages in the millions.\n\nIn June, Meta spent $14.3 billion on an investment in Scale AI — a deal widely seen as an acquihire of its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Google also made a similar move, acquiring the leaders of Windsurf, an AI coding platform. in a deal worth $2.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that Meta tried to lure his employees away with $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said OpenAI later offered to match.\n\nEven at smaller startups, someone in an AI leadership role can command between $300,000 and $400,000 in base pay, Shawn Thorne, managing director at executive search firm True Search, previously told Business Insider.\n\nSuleyman said \"rotation\" is part of the industry, given the small pool of talent. He cited Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI, Amar Subramanya, decamping to Apple earlier this month as an example.\n\nMicrosoft recently brought in several new hires from DeepMind and OpenAI, he said.\n\n\"There's certainly no 'no poach' agreements, that would not be legal,\" he added. \"People can go work for whoever they want to work for.\"",

    "description": "Gears of War fans hoping to see a new trailer for the upcoming prequel, Gears of War: E-Day, may have been disappointed that it skipped The Game Awards this year. That may be why the official Gears of War social media accounts have shared a message assuring fans that E-Day is still coming in 2026.\nThe image shared on the Gears of War X account didn't share any spoilers and it was just a skull set against some haunting red and black shades. But it did confirm the 2026 release window.",

    "description": "An internal memo, obtained by Business Insider, assessed Microsoft's deployment of cutting-edge GPUs.",
    "fullText": "As Nvidia works to install some of its newest chips in Microsoft data centers, an employee at the GPU giant observed in early fall that Microsoft's cooling approach at one facility seemed \"wasteful.\"\n\nNvidia has been deploying its GB200 Blackwell architecture at Microsoft and other tech giants as demand for compute to train and run AI models surges.\n\nBlackwell, announced in March 2024, is roughly twice as powerful as its predecessor, Hopper, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at launch. GB200 is part of an earlier wave of Blackwell deployments, with the GB300 generation now available.\n\nIn early fall, an internal email sent by a staffer on the Nvidia Infrastructure Specialists (NVIS) team described one Blackwell installation of server racks for OpenAI, which Microsoft supports as its cloud partner and largest investor.\n\nThe email described the setup of two GB200 NVL72 racks, each of which houses 72 Nvidia GPUs. The setup uses liquid cooling technology, given the heat generated by multiple GPUs operating closely in tandem.\n\nThe staffer wrote that Microsoft's \"cooling system and data center cooling approach for their GB200 deployment seems wasteful due to the size and lack of facility water use, but does provide a lot of flexibility and fault tolerance,\" according to the memo.\n\nWhile liquid cooling is used for the servers, data centers also use a second, building-level system to expel heat from the facility, according to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California.\n\nThe Nvidia employee may have been referring to a building-level system that uses air-cooling instead of water, explained Ren, who studies how data centers use water and other resources.\n\n\"This type of cooling system tends to be using more energy,\" he said, \"but it doesn't use water.\"\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson described a cooling setup consistent with Ren's two-phase explanation.\n\n\"Microsoft's liquid cooling heat exchanger unit is a closed-loop system that we deploy in existing air-cooled data centers to enhance cooling capacity on first and third-party platforms,\" the Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider in a statement.\n\n\"These systems ensure we maximize our existing global data center footprint for scale while promoting efficient heat dissipation and optimizing power delivery to meet the demands of AI and hyperscale systems,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs AI infrastructure expands, energy and water use in data-center cooling have become flashpoints globally, prompting pushback in some regions where new facilities are being built.\n\nRen noted that because data centers can use air cooling, water cooling, or a hybrid system at the building level, \"there's a trade-off\" between resources.\n\nAir cooling requires more energy, but can \"address some of the public concerns with water consumption — because water is something people can really see,\" he said.\n\n\"These companies are profit-driven,\" he added, \"they weigh in the water cost, the energy cost, and also the publicity cost.\"\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, said it intends to be \"carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste\" by 2030.\n\n\"We've also announced a zero water cooling design for our next-generation data centers and breakthroughs in on-chip cooling,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe internal email from the Nvidia staffer described some logistical hiccups that occurred during the Blackwell installation in early fall, which can be typical in the early deployment of new data center hardware.\n\n\"Onsite support for this activity was a necessity,\" the staffer wrote. \"Many hours were spent creating the validation process documentation as well as vetting the steps worked and made sense to those less familiar with how cluster and system validation is usually performed.\"\n\nAdditionally, the handover processes between Nvidia and Microsoft \"required a lot more solidification than what was performed before arrival.\"\n\nStill, the memo suggested Blackwell's production hardware quality had improved compared to early samples.\n\nThe email said GB200 NVL72 production hardware \"has good quality\" compared to the qualified samples sent to customers for early testing. Both racks had a 100% pass rate on certain compute performance tests.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider that its Blackwell systems \"deliver exceptional performance, reliability, and energy efficiency for a wide variety of computing applications.\"\n\n\"Our customers, including Microsoft, have successfully deployed hundreds of thousands of Blackwell GB200 and GB300 NVL72 systems to meet the world's growing need for artificial intelligence,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update for December is here, and Windows users should ensure their machines are updated as soon as possible to fix three zero-day vulnerabilities. These are security flaws that are actively exploited or publicly disclosed before the developer releases an official patch.\n\nAs reported by Bleeping Computer, this month's update addresses 56 bugs in total: 28 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, 19 remote-code-execution vulnerabilities, four information-disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial-of-service vulnerabilities, and two spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the remote code execution flaws are labeled \"critical.\" Note that these figures do not include updates released for Microsoft Edge and Mariner.\n\nPatch Tuesday is typically released on the second Tuesday of every month around 10am PT, so you can anticipate security updates at that time.\n\nOne of the zero-days patched in December has been actively exploited in the wild, though Microsoft has not shared any details as to how. CVE-2025-62221 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver, and when exploited, give attackers SYSTEM privileges. The mini filter allows cloud applications, such as OneDrive, access to file system functions.\n\nThe other two bugs fixed have been publicly disclosed:\n\nCVE-2025-64671 - GitHub Copilot for Jetbrains Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This flaw, which can be exploited through a Cross Prompt Injection in untrusted files or MCP servers, allows attackers to execute commands locally. According to Krebs on Security, this could trick the LLM into adding malicious instructions in the user's auto-approve settings.\n\nCVE-2025-54100 - PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: This bug could cause scripts embedded in a webpage to be executed when retrieved using Invoke-WebRequest.\n\nCVE-2025-62221 has been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).

    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets.\n\nMicrosoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines.\n\nOn a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's.\n\nNo one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\nSeveral Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation.\n\nMicrosoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals.\n\nThe bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer.\n\nMicrosoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company.\n\nThe new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60.\n\nMicrosoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI.\n\nEffective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites.\n\nSmall-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers.\n\nRationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities.\n\nBusiness Basic: $7 per user per month\n\nHere's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares:\n\nMicrosoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRemaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase.\n\nSegments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing.\n\nThe board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026.\n\nIt's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins.\n\nIn the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI.\n\nAll sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand.\n\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\n\nWindows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’\n\nMichael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet\n\nIn the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch.\n\nThe updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption.\n\nPenetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats.\n\nAzure AI usage (workload and usage mix).\n\nBefore the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates.\n\nThe quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore.\n\nThat's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.",
