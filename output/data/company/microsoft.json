    "description": "Users could be tricked into running arbitrary code, but the issue was patched last week.",
    "fullText": "AI-related changes to Notepad—yes, that Notepad—allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on your computer. The vulnerability was related to Markdown support, which was added last year. Markdown is a simple way to add formatting, including links, to plaintext documents—and links were the source of the vulnerability.\n\n\"An attacker could trick a user into clicking a malicious link inside a Markdown file opened in Notepad, causing the application to launch unverified protocols that load and execute remote files,\" according to the security response notice.\n\nMarkdown has long been popular in certain parts of the internet—anyone who occasionally comments on Reddit or chats using Discord is likely at least a little familiar with it. But the markup language has become even more important in the age of AI—most documents are converted to plain text Markdown files to train models.\n\nMarkdown support was added around the same time Copilot was integrated into Notepad, as part of a broader push to add AI to every corner of the operating system. And there's an argument to be made that all these AI additions are adding up to new vulnerabilities. Microsoft patched 1,129 bugs in 2025 according to Krebs on Security, a prominent cybersecurity blog. That's an 11.9% increase over the previous year, which was already unusually high. Microsoft itself admits that AI agents will open up new vulnerabilities, even as the company adds them to Windows.\n\nThis is all to say that installing security updates is likely more important now than ever. Sure, you could disable all AI features in Windows, but that's unlikely to protect you from all the new vulnerabilities—installing Linux might, though.\n\nLuckily for Windows users, this vulnerability was fixed in Microsoft's February 2026 security update. To find out if you've installed it, open the Settings app, head to \"Windows Update,\" then check if an update labeled \"2026-02 Security Update\" is waiting to be installed. If so, click the \"Restart Now\" button to install the update.",

    "description": "You might not have to start all over again.",
    "fullText": "There's little worse than losing an hour or two of hard work, just by clicking on the wrong button or pressing the wrong key in Microsoft Word—a mistake that sees your well-crafted document (or a sizable portion of it) disappear before your eyes.\n\nA slip of the fingers isn't the only way you can potentially lose work, either. Maybe you just have the misfortune to be busy at your computer when a power outage happens—taking your desktop, Microsoft Word, and your unsaved work along with it.\n\nHowever, before you begin all over again, there are some tricks you can try to bring your work back.\n\nSometimes, all you need is the undo command—hit Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Cmd+Z (macOS) to undo your last action in Word. It might be enough to restore that table you accidentally deleted, or bring back that huge block of text you moved to the clipboard and have since lost track of.\n\nThis won't save you from a power outage, and it doesn't include all actions (it won't bring back a file you've closed, for example). However, it'll work a lot of the time when you've made a mistake, and Word always keeps a record of your last 100 actions in the app, so you can go back a fair way.\n\nThere's also an undo button up in the top left corner of the Word interface: Click on this to undo the last action, or click the arrow next to it to see a list of previous actions and choose where you want to go back to. To the right of the undo button is the redo button, which works the same way but in the opposite direction.\n\nWord also has a file version history feature you can utilize to bring back lost work: It essentially saves past versions of your document at regular intervals, so you can go back in time, and even all the way back to the file's creation. It's like a super undo, which works between app restarts as well.\n\nIn Word for Windows, you can find these older incarnations of your document by heading to File > Info > Version History. If you're using Word on macOS, it's File > Browse Version History. A new sidebar opens on the right, showing all the available previous versions, and the date and time they were saved.\n\nThere is a caveat to this, though, which is you have to have your document saved in the cloud (in OneDrive) for this to work. If you're working with a local file that's only saved on your computer and you try and access version history, you'll be prompted to save it to OneDrive instead (which will turn on version history).\n\nWord actually saves files temporarily to your computer every so often, so if the program crashes without warning, you should see an autorecovery dialog pop up the next time you load Word, asking if you want to recover the old file. If not, you can see partially saved files by clicking Click File > Info > Manage Document > Recover Unsaved Documents.\n\nThat's only for Windows, however—if you're on macOS, you're relying on the auto-recovery process. Word for both Windows and macOS lets you set how often auto-recovery files are saved: Head to File > Options > Save (Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save (macOS). The default is every 10 minutes, but you can adjust this if needed.\n\nIf you're still not seeing your file, you can try checking the temporary cache folder manually. On Windows, check \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Word\" or \"C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\UnsavedFiles.\" On macOS try \"/Users//Library/Containers/com.Microsoft/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery\"—adding in your own username where relevant.\n\nThese days, Microsoft Word will tend to push you to save your work in OneDrive in the cloud. There are multiple benefits for this, including the version history feature mentioned above, and the option to collaborate on documents with other people. It also enables another handy feature: AutoSave.\n\nThis is exactly what it sounds like, and means that every time something is changed in your document, it quickly syncs to the cloud. You'll see the AutoSave button in the top left hand corner enabled when it's active, and the document name at the top of the app window will indicate when saves are in progress.\n\nShould Word or your PC crash, your work should be safe. AutoSave is enabled by default for files saved to OneDrive, but you can customize this behavior by heading to File > Options > Save on Windows) or Word > Preferences > Save on macOS.",

    "description": "An AI gamification manager shares how she went from a contract executive assistant at Microsoft to an AI gamification product manager.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Brit Morenus, a 37-year-old senior AI gamification program manager, based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been at Microsoft for a total of 13 years, but for five and a half, I was a contract worker.\n\nI graduated from college with a degree focused on English, communications, and marketing. I first landed a job at Microsoft as a contract executive assistant. I stayed in that role for about eight months, then joined the marketing team.\n\nEventually, I had the opportunity to take a really special position, but it required knowing gamification. Gamification is about integrating game mechanics and motivators, such as storytelling and reward systems, into learning. So I was going to teach people about our products and sell them in a gamified way.\n\nI spent about a year getting certifications that taught me about gamification. I upskilled and learned how to create games, what game mechanics are, and what motivates someone when they're learning.\n\nThat was the position where I was able to prove my impact, and they decided to bring me on full-time. I stayed in that role for another six years, training the frontline and customer service support to develop the right sales skills.\n\nEventually, I had the opportunity to start gamifying learning about AI. They wanted someone with gamification skills, and my certifications and experience made me the ideal candidate.\n\nI didn't know much about AI yet, aside from using it for personal reasons, but transitioning to an AI role was actually faster than pivoting to gamification. Since I held the gamification role for about six years, I became really good at it. It only took about three months for me to upskill in AI.\n\nIn my first three months on the team, I made myself knowledgeable about AI to the point where I could teach others about it. That's when I got a certification in Azure AI Fundamentals. It was a certification specific to how Microsoft's AI works.\n\nI helped my entire team get it, and then I helped my entire organization start working on it. Then I helped the greater customer service support organization work toward getting it as well.\n\nMy advice to those who want to transition would be: Don't let fear keep you from stepping outside your comfort zone. There's so much ambiguity about changing roles or companies, but there's no time like the present.\n\nWith AI specifically, you just need to learn. Everyone already uses it, but you need to understand how it works, because that's how you can understand what to do with it.\n\nIt's also important to upskill yourself. You have to be willing to constantly move and learn more, because it's going to keep changing — and faster than you can grasp it. Sometimes AI makes wrong predictions, but it is using words to make that prediction. So I absolutely need to use my English degree in order to figure out keywords and how to prompt it to do the right thing.\n\nUp until this Al role, I always joked that I wasn't using my English degree. But now I use it everywhere, and it truly does help. It helps with things like talking to executives and also with the role itself.\n\nIt's important to know the language of AI and how it operates. So now, more than ever, I am using every bit of my English degree and understanding English, grammar, and how it all functions.\n\nFor example, there's a tagging process that happens behind the scenes with AI, just like on social media. Looking at an image, it might tag it as a woman, or a supermarket, and that gives it a confidence score and tells you if it's relevant or not, and if it's what we're looking for.\n\nA lot of it is more about understanding how to apply the English language than about AI — so, thanks, Mom and Dad, I am using the degree you paid for.\n\nThis is part of an ongoing series about workers who transitioned into AI roles. Did you pivot to AI? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or secure-messaging platform Signal at aalt.19.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's AI CEO is joining a chorus of executives who say they anticipate widespread job automation driven by artificial intelligence.\n\nMustafa Suleyman, the Microsoft AI chief, said in an interview with the Financial Times that he predicts most, if not every, task in white-collar fields will be automated by AI within the next year or year and a half.\n\n\"I think that we're going to have a human-level performance on most, if not all, professional tasks,\" Suleyman said in the interview that was published Wednesday. \"So white-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months.\"\n\nThe CEO said the trend is already observable in software engineering, in which employees are using \"AI-assisted coding for the vast majority of their code production.\"\n\n\"It's a quite different relationship to the technology, and that's happened in the last six months,\" he said.\n\nAI's rapid advancement over the past half-decade has brought about real, documented shifts in how some white-collar work is performed.\n\nBusiness Insider recently reported that \"AI fatigue\" has hit software engineering: the technology has unlocked productivity but also exhaustion, as workers are expected to take on more work at once.\n\nMicrosoft is one of the leading companies behind the push to introduce AI in the workplace, building products like Copilot and investing in OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nSome leaders and pioneers in AI say that artificial intelligence will advance far enough to replace entire workforces.\n\nStuart Russell, a computer scientist who co-authored one of the world's most authoritative books on AI, said in an interview last year that political leaders are looking at \"80% unemployment\" due to AI, as jobs ranging from surgeons to CEOs are at risk of being replaced.\n\nDario Amodei, CEO and cofounder of Anthropic, previously said AI could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs.\n\n\"We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming,\" Amodei told Axios in an interview. \"I don't think this is on people's radar.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "There were 58 vulnerabilities in total.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's February security update is a big one. This latest \"Patch Tuesday\" fixes 58 vulnerabilities in total, six of which are zero-day flaws. As a reminder, a zero-day is a vulnerability that has been either actively exploited in the wild or publicly disclosed before an official fix is released by the developer.\n\nAs BleepingComputer reports, security flaws were found in the following categories: 25 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, five security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 12 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, six information disclosure vulnerabilities, three denial of service vulnerabilities, and seven spoofing vulnerabilities. Three of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities and two of the information disclosure vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\" (These numbers do not include the three Microsoft Edge vulnerabilities patched earlier in February.)\n\nPatch Tuesday updates are typically released around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of every month, and your device should receive them automatically. BleepingComputer reports that this month's release also includes Secure Boot certificate updates for 2011 certificates that are expiring in June.\n\nThree of the six actively exploited zero-days fixed in February are security feature bypass vulnerabilities:\n\nCVE-2026-21510: This is a flaw the Windows Shell that allows an attacker to execute content without warning or gaining user consent, though the user does need to open a malicious link or shortcut file.\n\nCVE-2026-21513: This MSHTML Framework vulnerability allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network. Microsoft has not released details on how this flaw was exploited.\n\nCVE-2026-21514: This vulnerability in Microsoft Word allows an attacker to bypasses OLE mitigations in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Office once a user has opened a malicious Office file.\n\nAll three of the above flaws have been attributed to Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), Office Product Group Security Team, and Google Threat Intelligence Group along with an anonymous researcher for CVE-2026-21510 and CVE-2026-21514.\n\nTwo of the zero-days are elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. CVE-2026-21519 is a Desktop Windows Manager flaw that allows an attacker to gain SYSTEM privileges, while CVE-2026-21533 is a Windows Remote Desktop Services flaw that allows an attacker to elevate privileges locally. The former has been attributed to MSTIC and MSRC, while the latter was discovered by the Advanced Research Team at CrowdStrike.\n\nFinally, CVE-2026-21525 is a denial of service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager that allows an unauthorized attacker to deny service locally. This flaw was discovered by the ACROS Security team with 0patch—it was reportedly found in a public malware repository in December 2025.",

    "fullText": "Posted by Jeremy Hellstrom | | General Tech | 0\n\nThe root certificates used for Microsoft’s Secure Boot, to ensure only signed and trusted bootloaders are allowed to launch on UEFI devices expire in June.  This is for any and all devices produced between 2011 and late 2024, as Microsoft did start providing the updated certificates to hardware manufacturers last year.  The new Secure Boot certificates are being pushed via Windows Update, for the most part, which means if you are using an older version of Windows 11 or are still on Windows 10 you will not be getting the new certs.\n\nTo make things even more fun, not every machine can get new certs via the updates pushed via Windows Update.  As you might expect, Microsoft is making that their customer’s problem and suggesting they reach out to their OEM to get the proper update.  Microsoft can’t even be bothered to list what machines these might possibly be, essentially guaranteeing they will never be updated since the user will likely be unaware that their Secure Boot certs have expired.\n\nThankfully having expired certificates won’t prevent a machine from booting, it will just mean you are completely unprotected from nefarious bootloaders.  The vast majority of users who need to go the extra mile to update their Secure Boot certs are unlikely to follow up, unless it breaks their favourite game.   The new generation of anti-cheat software requires Secure Boot to be enabled, and this certificate update is sure to cause issues, which the users are most likely going to blame on the game publisher, not Microsoft.\n\nSeeing as how Microsoft is never one to screw up in minor ways, today they also announced that Windows 11 26H1 will not be pushed via Windows Update. It will only be available, pre-installed, on select machines; before you celebrate please recall that Windows 11 25H2 hits EoL next October.  The garbage piles of electronic waste created by their decision to require TPM 2.0 will grow even taller unless they reverse course.  The thundering reaction from their Enterprise customers is sure to be heard by Microsoft, we shall see if they realize they need to do something about it in the coming months.",

    "description": "A software engineer at Microsoft took his health for granted before being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis Now, he's more thoughtful about how he spends his time and energy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is transforming the company's culture during his tenure, leaving a lasting impression on some current and former employees.\n\nThat includes Jeffrey Snover, a retired Microsoft chief technology officer and Google engineer, who recalled an \"actionable lesson in leadership\" he learned from Nadella in a recent blog post.\n\nIn short, he said, Nadella stressed that executives need to figure out how to succeed with the resources they have, rather than complain.\n\n\"If you are an exec and don't have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy,\" Snover wrote. \"Quit whining and wasting time trying to get the resources to support that strategy — do your job — get a strategy that can work with the resources you have.\"\n\nIn a subsequent statement shared with Business Insider, Snover said he thinks Nadella is \"the best CEO in America by a very wide margin.\"\n\nIn the blog post, Snover recalled the speech Nadella gave during a meeting with Microsoft's senior executives that laid out the leadership lesson.\n\n\"Don't come whining that you don't have the resources you need. We've done our homework. We've evaluated the portfolio, considered the opportunities, and allocated our available resources to those opportunities,\" Nadella said, according to Snover. \"That is what you have to work with. Your job is to manufacture success with the resources you've been allocated.\"\n\nSnover wrote that Nadella, who became CEO in 2014, told executives they could control only two things: How they managed their teams and how they allocated resources.\n\n\"And I want to be clear with you. If you are in this room, you need to deliver outsized success. To do that, you will need to allocate resources ahead of conventional wisdom​,\" Nadella said. \"Conventional wisdom will generate conventional success, and that won't allow you to stay in this room. You need to have courage and be bold.\"\n\nSnover, who left Microsoft in 2022, said Nadella's speech provided executives with a framework for thriving.\n\n\"Satya was not giving us a pep talk, he was giving us an architecture for success,\" Snover wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up blog post, Snover wrote that project proposals were gathered ahead of the meeting, so it was the \"Lord of the Flies/Game of Thrones stage of resource allocation.\"\n\n\"Resource allocation isn't just about money; it's the most effective weapon for killing redundancy and enforcing architectural alignment,\" Snover wrote. \"If you can't afford to build your own silo, you finally start acting like a platform company.\"\n\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft's company culture shifted from being highly competitive toward an emphasis on teamwork, including implementing an evaluation system that rewarded collaboration.",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "fullText": "Mustafa Suleyman says vibe coding is rapidly lowering the barrier to building apps, a shift that could put traditional software at risk.\n\nThe Microsoft AI CEO said in an episode of the \"Exponential View\" podcast published Thursday that AI tools now make it possible for anyone to quickly start launching code and apps.\n\n\"It is so accessible now,\" said Suleyman. \"You can watch a three-minute video, get spun up, launch one of these things.\"\n\n\"You can create an app, a web app in seconds,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman said people don't need deep technical skills to get started. Instead, they can learn by experimenting, watching, and doing.\n\nThe AI can \"build something that you may have thought was never possible,\" he said.\n\n\"Unless you push these things to their edges and explore the boundaries, you won't really understand the magic, or what they're kind of bad at.\"\n\n\"Everyone's got to get stuck into that motion,\" he added.\n\nSuleyman also said he has vibe-coded a system that tracks the DJs he wants to see, coming concerts and festivals, and then matches those events with his travel schedule. What used to be manual work now runs automatically in a spreadsheet that updates throughout the year.\n\nSuleyman's comments come as investors grow increasingly anxious that AI tools and agents could wipe out entire categories of software.\n\nThat fear flared this week after Anthropic said it was adding legal-focused capabilities to its Cowork assistant. The tools would allow AI to review legal documents and track compliance — work typically done by legal software.\n\nMarkets didn't take it lightly. Shares of legal-software companies in Europe and the US fell sharply on Tuesday, before the selling spread across the wider software sector and into tech.\n\nOpenAI triggered a similar sell-off months earlier after rolling out internal AI-powered software-as-a-service tools.\n\nMany of the tools now unsettling the tech sector were built using AI coding tools.\n\nAI personal assistant OpenClaw was created with the help of AI, while Moltbook — a viral, Reddit-style forum for AI agents — was entirely vibe-coded.\n\nAnthropic also said last month that it built its Cowork assistant using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. During a livestream, Rieseberg said his team put Cowork together in just over a week, thanks to Claude.\n\nTech leaders and developers have also said that such a turnaround is becoming the norm.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind OpenClaw, said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published last week that AI now lets developers \"build everything.\"\n\nOpenAI's chair, Bret Taylor, said in an episode of the \"Big Technology Podcast\" published last week that building software quickly through vibe coding will soon feel routine rather than novel.\n\nBut the real question, Taylor said, is what software still matters.\n\nInstead of dashboards, browser forms, and traditional apps, he expects AI agents to become the dominant software interface.\n\n\"Who's making those agents is the question,\" he said. \"Will you buy those agents off the shelf or build them yourself?\"",

    "description": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026: Open source gains urgency as Europe reassesses reliance on US tech",
    "fullText": "Open Source Policy Summit 2026 European tech leaders are waking up to the risk of the US simply turning off their IT services.\n\nThe Register FOSS desk attended the 2026 Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels last week. The tone of the event was distinctly different to that of the same event three years ago. We encountered new notes of determination, expressed forcefully by Finnish MEP Aura Salla:\n\nIn case some listeners didn't see the problem with that:\n\nThe US could turn us off inside one hour.\n\nThe Reg has quoted Salla before. She has been making this point for a while, with increasing directness, but just over a year into Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States, it continues to grow in importance.\n\nAs we covered in October last year, one of the leaders in this effort is the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which switched away from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to Open-Xchange and Mozilla Thunderbird. The head of Schleswig's Chancellery and Minister for Digital Transformation, Dirk Schrödter, gave a keynote saying: \"We are free; now everyone must follow.\"\n\nHe noted that although it had saved the state government money, it wasn't without cost. The process had required significant expenditure, but that was good for European businesses that had helped the state in its transition. We liked his summary of the status quo:\n\nWe're in the habit of exporting public money out of Europe, and importing dependencies.\n\nIn a later panel on \"Open Source and Economic Security,\" he noted that digitization in Germany can be difficult, partly due to its state-level IT management and strategy. He recommended a pragmatic approach:\n\nDon't look at the big mountain in the distance. Look at concrete steps you can take to start.\n\nSo, for now, Schleswig is still running Windows, but has replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice on \"nearly 100 percent\" of machines. It's using Thunderbird for email, calendars, and contacts, talking to Open-Xchange on the back end, alongside the Matrix-based Element for chat and Nextcloud for collaboration.\n\nOther speakers on the same panel made the point that FOSS doesn't mean free of charge, but spending money with European companies means benefits to European economies – keeping more of the EU's vast public spending inside the EU. As Leontina Sandu put it: \"We spend 0.4 percent of EU money on software licenses. It's a lot – public sector spending is half of the EU's GDP.\" Blogger Markus Sandelin estimates that the EU spends over €200 million a year just on Microsoft 365 licenses.\n\nCompanies working on open source in Europe, of course, stand to profit significantly from this. Thales's Daniel Glazman put it more bluntly: \"Open source will succeed when we forget the word 'cost.'\" IBM's Jochen Friedrich shared a pithy one-line summary of how Europe needs to transform its economies away from old heavy industries and into open \n\nThe Eclipse Foundation's Mike Milinkovich echoed Salla's earlier point that Microsoft effectively had a kill switch over Office 365, but pointed out that the company has more such controls: it also owns GitHub. As he put it, \"more or less every company and organization in Europe pulls from GitHub, because it uses JavaScript and Maven, so this applies to them too.\"\n\nPortuguese professor Mario Campolargo flipped the equation around. Any part of the EU paying for software should be sharing the code it's paying for:\n\nIf the money is public, the code should be public.\n\nOf course, this isn't just a European problem. It applies just as much to the nearly 200 countries of the United Nations. A short item, oddly described as an \"intervention,\" talked about the upcoming UN Open Source Week 2026 and the UN Open Source Principles – including that the city of Barcelona just adopted them.\n\nTo most people working with FOSS, they probably seem simple and reasonable, but having the UN on board adds considerable clout, and spelling them out is the sort of thing that reassures technophobic politicians:",

This was not an issue for Amazon’s October earnings, as its shares jumped almost 10% following better than expected revenue from Amazon Web Services, also known as AWS. Now, however, fear is rippling through the tech sector, and Amazon investors are increasingly concerned that the slowdown at Microsoft’s Azure indicates broader weakness for cloud providers.

    "description": "Craig Mundie, ex-Microsoft exec, discusses AI's impact on education. He urges a shift to personalized learning with AI and STEM-humanities integration.",
    "fullText": "Ex-Microsoft exec Craig Mundie has heard this question again and again — parents asking him a version of the same worry: Their kids are heading toward college, artificial intelligence is advancing fast, and jobs feel uncertain. What, exactly, should their kids be studying?\n\nThat question — what education will matter most in five years — reflects a deeper uncertainty about the future.\n\nMundie, who spent 22 years at Microsoft helping steer the company's vision toward AI and retired as the company's chief research and strategy officer in 2014, says that parents are simply asking the wrong question.\n\nIt's not only the students who have to change to fit the new AI era — it's the education system itself, said Mundie, who now advises other executives on AI and public policy.\n\nRather than chasing down the right job, Mundie urges families to prepare kids for a world where learning itself becomes continuous, personalized, and done in partnership with intelligent machines.\n\nDuring an interview with Business Insider's Reem Makhoul in June, Mundie said artificial intelligence and robotics are poised to reshape work more deeply than past technologies. See the edited cut of his interview below:\n\nThat shift, Mundie said, forces a bigger question than which job skills will survive. It challenges how societies define human value. This is something Mundie's been pondering for over a decade.\n\nIn his 2015 book \"Genesis,\" Mundie, with co-authors Eric Schmidt and Henry Kissinger, examined how AI could alter the human experience. \"What we say is we have to think differently about how we value ourselves and what we do.\"\n\nFor much of history, he said, dignity has been tied to work because people had to work to survive. AI could loosen that link by automating more tasks across both physical and intellectual labor.\n\nMeanwhile, humans will need to learn how to work alongside intelligent machines, and the traditional higher-education system doesn't offer a clear path toward that, right now.\n\nHe described today's education system as sharply divided between STEM and the humanities. The liberal arts emphasize reasoning, but at the expense of special technical skills you learn in STEM fields, Mundie said.\n\nStudents will need both skills moving forward. \"If I could create a new curriculum in college, it would be a liberal education in technology,\" and STEM, he said.\n\nMundie went further, questioning whether the classroom model that dominates education today still makes sense.\n\nHe traced that structure back to the printing press, which created a surge in written information and a need for mass literacy. Schools, he said, became an efficient \"machine for teaching\" because societies lacked enough individual tutors.\n\nWe can have scalable, polymathic teachers, Mundie said. \"We can have as many teachers as we want now because the AI will be the teacher.\"\n\nHe said this opens the door to a more personalized, Socratic model of learning, where students can interact continuously with an intelligent system that adapts to their curiosity, pace, and interests. Progress would be limited less by standardized curricula and more by a student's motivation and capacity.\n\nSchools and universities have been slow to embrace this shift. Early reactions often involved banning AI tools outright. \"They've now given up on that,\" Mundie said.\n\nThat resistance, he added, is typical of incumbent systems. \"The natural tendency of the incumbent is to preserve the incumbent system,\" or make only incremental changes, he added. But \"when you get something as powerful as these AIs, most incumbent systems are not going to be preserved.\"\n\nHe also pointed to early experiments on the right track, like versions of Khan Academy, an online non-profit educational platform founded in 2008 and headquartered in California. It uses an AI tutor, named Khanmigo, designed to guide students rather than simply give answers. In those systems, he said, the AI nudges students toward better questions and deeper understanding.\n\n\"So that's the difference between sort of a broad chat about anything interface and an AI application that was specifically oriented around teaching,\" he said, adding, \"That's just one tiny example of how people will build more and more apps on these common artificial intelligence platforms.\"\n\n\"We will move beyond the specific generic interface to a world of millions of applications that are really customized in some clever way to guide people to solutions in the areas they care about,\" he said. These agents may, in fact, do much of the work autonomously by interacting with others, he added.\n\nMundie said parents and older generations may have difficulty imagining this model, while children are likely to adapt quickly. The harder question, in his view, is whether educational institutions are willing to change.",

    "description": "Microsoft's security boss Charlie Bell is moving to a new role as an individual contributor.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's security boss, Charlie Bell, is moving to a new role as an individual contributor, and the company hired Google executive Hayete Gallot to replace him, according to an internal memo from CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nGallot is a former Microsoft executive who joined Google in 2024 as president of customer experience for Google Cloud. Nadella called out Gallot's 15 years of experience at Microsoft in senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, and said Gallot was instrumental in the company's security business.\n\nBell, considered a key building of Amazon Web Services, joined Microsoft in 2021 to run a newly formed organization focused on cybersecurity. There was recent speculation inside Microsoft that Bell was preparing to retire. Bell's new role will be \"focused on engineering quality,\" according to the memo.\n\nMicrosoft has faced security challenges during Bell's tenure.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security in 2024, for example, condemned Microsoft for what it called \"a cascade of security failures\" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers.\n\nMicrosoft, that same year, expanded what the company calls its Secure Future Initiative, making security the top priority for every employee, including adding security as a metric on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews.\n\nBell was expected to be a candidate to replace Andy Jassy when he took over as Amazon CEO for founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Instead, Jassy chose Adam Selipsky, who was previously AWS's de facto chief operating officer until he left in 2016 to become CEO of Tableau. Selipsky stepped down from that role in 2024.\n\nI am excited to share a couple updates in two of our core priorities: security and quality. Hayete Gallot is rejoining Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Security, reporting to me. I've also asked Charlie Bell to take on a new role focused on engineering quality, reporting to me.\n\nCharlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer. And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!\n\nHayete joins us from Google where she was President, Customer Experience for Google Cloud. Before that, she spent more than 15 years at Microsoft with senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, playing multiple critical roles in building two of our biggest franchises — Windows and Office, leading our commercial solution areas go to market efforts. And she was instrumental in the design and implementation of our Security Solution Area. She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now.\n\nAs we shared during our quarterly earnings last week, we have great momentum in security, including progress with Security Copilot agents, strong Purview adoption, and continued customer growth, and we will build on this.\n\nWe have a deep bench of talent and leaders across our security business, and this team will now report to Hayete. Additionally, Ales Holecek will take on a new role as Chief Architect for Security, reporting to Hayete. Ales has spent years leading architecture and development across some of our most important platforms and will help bring that same sensibility to security and its connections back to our existing scale businesses and the Agent Platform.\n\nAs we shared yesterday, we have a new operating rhythm with commercial cohorts, and Hayete and her team will now be accountable for our security product rhythms as part of this process.\n\nCharlie built our Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management organization and helped rally the company behind the Secure Future Initiative. And we're fortunate to have his continued focus and leadership on another one of our top priorities. With our Quality Excellence Initiative, we have increased accountability and accelerated progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we always deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. And Charlie will partner closely with Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on this work.\n\nI'm excited to welcome Hayete back to Microsoft to advance this mission critical work, and grateful to Charlie for all he has done for our security business and what he will continue to do for the company.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Judson Althoff, a veteran Microsoft executive recently promoted to commercial CEO, is making changes to the top ranks of his team, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHe elevated Deb Cupp to executive vice president and chief revenue officer of global enterprise sales, according to the memo. Cupp's previous title was president and chief revenue officer of enterprise, according to an internal organizational chart from when Althoff was promoted in October.\n\nAlthoff's promotion was intended to give CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described the moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nCupp has been at Microsoft for more than eight years and is known for helping the company tailor cloud services for specific industries. In this new role, Cupp will help handle the company's most strategic customer accounts and executive relationships.\n\n\"Judson expanded the remits of his leadership team to free up more time to focus on Microsoft's commercial product strategy and to keep the feedback loop between customers and product decisions as small as possible,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. \"This feedback loop is critical right now because AI is being adopted at extraordinary speed, and our customers expect these capabilities to come to life in their business faster than ever before.\"\n\nAccording to the memo, Althoff made other changes, including:\n\nCommercial business update and leadership announcement\n\nWe have all been rapidly changing how we work as an AI-first company, and we are evolving how we operate to reflect the same. We must become faster, flatter, and more agile in our operating rhythms, empowering our people with the authority to make decisions and removing the friction for them to do so.\n\nOur commercial cohort operating model has illustrated how effective we can be as a company. The cohort forums are intellectually honest sessions aimed at tightening the feedback loop between the voice of the customer and our product ethos. This approach brings engineering, marketing, sales, services, and operations together across the topics that matter most for our business, ensuring that our product ambitions accrue to our customers' needs in this era of Frontier Transformation. In the runup to Ignite, we collaborated through this process to formulate our Intelligence + Trust strategy and pave the way forward for Copilot, our IQ and developer platforms, and Agent 365.\n\nWith this new commercial model established, I will be asking more of our MCAPS leadership to run the business in service of our customers and partners. In recognition of their increased scope and responsibility, I am pleased to share the following role changes to Executive Vice President, which will continue reporting directly to me:\n\nDeb Cupp is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Global Enterprise. She will continue leading our global enterprise sales organization.\n\nMala Anand is our EVP & Chief Customer Experience Officer, bringing together our full spectrum of services including Industry Solutions Delivery, Customer Success, and Support—across Customer Experience & Success.\n\nNick Parker is our EVP & Chief Business Officer of Worldwide Sales & Solutions (WSS). His team leads Commercial Solution Areas, co-engineering, and sales teams including enterprise, industry, partner, and devices.\n\nRalph Haupter is our EVP & Chief Revenue Officer, Small, Medium Enterprises & Channel (SME&C) focused on earning increased share down market through agentic selling and scaling with our Cloud Solution Provider partners.\n\nPlease join me in congratulating Deb, Mala, Nick, and Ralph.\n\nKim Akers will continue in her current capacity as our Chief Operating Officer, and Takeshi Numoto remains our Chief Marketing Officer, also reporting directly to me.\n\nI am inspired by how these teams and the cohort operating model are strengthening our core values of customer obsession and One Microsoft. With an increased focus on the commercial business across the company, I look forward to leading our customers, partners, and Microsoft through Frontier Transformation alongside all of you.\n\nJudson\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Priyanka Kuvalekar, a 31-year-old UX research lead at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI joined Microsoft in April 2025 as a senior UX researcher. I lead research for Microsoft Teams Calling and related AI experiences.\n\nMy path to this job wasn't typical. I spent five years studying architecture in college, not computer science or AI, and earned my degree in India.\n\nI started my career with a full-time internship as a junior architect while completing the final year of my degree. After I graduated, I began thinking seriously about my next steps. Should I continue as an architect or pivot into the digital world?\n\nI enrolled in a three-month user experience course, which led me to pursue a master's degree in user experience and interaction design.\n\nI moved to Philadelphia and began my master's program in January 2018. My first industry step was an internship as a UX researcher at Korn Ferry. After a year of interning, I was offered a full-time role, which I held until 2021.\n\nI broke into Big Tech at Cisco in October 2021 and worked as a UX research lead for over 3 1/2 years before taking my current position at Microsoft.\n\nI led projects focused on AI features for Webex meetings and messaging as the lead researcher.\n\nI knew I needed to understand AI's mechanics, so I pursued certifications and training, both through my employer and independently, on generative AI, agentic AI design patterns, large language models, and evaluating AI experiences as a researcher.\n\nI also explored courses and online resources on UI design from platforms such as Google Skills, Microsoft Training, and DeepLearning.AI to understand how generative AI could be applied to my projects.\n\nHere are the three biggest lessons I learned that helped me break into AI with a non-tech background.\n\nI learned that you need to understand how to evaluate AI in practice. AI isn't something you test once, and then it's \"done.\" It requires ongoing evaluation to ensure it continues to deliver trustworthy experiences.\n\nThis meant designing qualitative studies that examined how AI conversations hold up across diverse user groups. Inconsistencies in tone, misinterpretations of meaning, and pacing issues were revealed in this research.\n\nAnother key lesson came from approaching AI through an accessibility lens. AI can make tasks easier and reduce barriers for people with disabilities — for example, by automating steps. It can also create new inequities if not designed with accessibility in mind.\n\nAccessibility and AI can't be separated. I've learned to include people with disabilities in AI research and to evaluate how AI integrates with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.\n\nBreaking into AI also taught me that you don't have to build the technology yourself to make an impact, but you do need to understand it well enough to engage with it.\n\nIt's about learning just enough to bridge the gap between technical teams and user needs, and to ensure that how you gauge AI quality is rooted in real user experience.\n\nGaining fluency meant understanding the concepts behind how large language models work, their limitations, and how to design evaluation frameworks that account for those limits.\n\nThis has helped me ask engineers the right questions and design studies that measure trust, reliability, and consistency across different user groups. It's also helped me work closely with product managers to define what success looks like for AI experiences.\n\nI recommend starting where AI meets people, not where AI meets code — focus on how AI shows up in products and how people experience it.\n\nOne of the most practical ways to add value without a traditional background is by shaping what \"quality\" means for an AI feature. Work with product managers to ask questions like, Does the AI stay within scope? Does it handle interruptions gracefully? Is it inclusive across languages and dialects?\n\nThese things often get overlooked when you view AI only as a technical system, but they're crucial to user trust. If you can frame them in actionable terms, you can become indispensable.\n\nHiring managers don't just want to see that you know AI exists — they want to see how you can shape it responsibly and make it usable.\n\nDocument all frameworks, rubrics, evaluation studies, and examples of how your insights influenced decisions. Even if you don't have access to big-company projects, you can run your own small-scale studies on publicly available AI tools and use those to showcase your thinking.\n\nTry volunteering for projects where AI is being integrated into existing tools, and answer questions like, What does this AI feature need to do? How should it behave? Can the AI explain what it can or can't do? Does it recover gracefully when it makes a mistake?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions researchers, product thinkers, and others with non-traditional backgrounds are uniquely positioned to answer.",

    "description": "30 years of Windows widgets - from Active Desktop to the Widget Board. Six implementations, six deaths, and the scar tissue that shapes the platform you'd build on today.",
    "fullText": "The full history of Windows widgets, from 1997 to today.\n\nEvery constraint you'll hit today exists because of a specific past disaster.\n\nMicrosoft has been trying to solve the same UX problem since 1997: how to surface live information without making you launch an app. They've shipped six different implementations across nearly 30 years. Each one died from a different fundamental flaw - performance, security, screen space, privacy, engagement. And each death triggered the same reflex: containment.\n\nThe pattern goes like this. Microsoft releases widgets into the wild. Users or attackers find the breaking point. Microsoft panics, kills the feature, and ships the next version locked inside a tighter box. Active Desktop splashed HTML across the wallpaper - performance collapsed, so Vista contained widgets in a rigid sidebar. Users hated losing screen space, so Windows 7 freed gadgets to float anywhere - then a security exploit blew the whole platform apart. Windows 8 responded by locking widgets into a full-screen Start Screen nobody wanted. The cycle repeats: build, ship, backlash, kill, rebuild with more walls.\n\nUnderstanding why each containment failed tells you exactly what constraints shape the platform you'd build on today. Every design decision in the current architecture - the declarative Adaptive Cards format, the native WinUI 3 renderer, the overlay-instead-of-dock layout - exists because of a specific past disaster. The constraints you'll hit when building widgets today aren't arbitrary. They're scar tissue.\n\nInternet Explorer 4.0 shipped in 1997 with a component called the Windows Desktop Update. It fused the Trident rendering engine into explorer.exe, turning the Windows wallpaper from a static bitmap into a live HTML surface. Microsoft called it Active Desktop.\n\nThe most visible piece was the Active Channel Bar - a vertical strip docked to the right edge of the screen, populated with branded buttons for Disney, MSNBC, Warner Bros, and CNN. Each button represented a \"Channel,\" a website that pushed content to your machine for offline reading. The backbone was Channel Definition Format (CDF), an XML standard that told your PC which pages to download and when.\n\nA small red sparkle called the \"Gleam\" appeared on a channel's icon when new content arrived. It was an early attempt at the notification patterns we now take for granted. The handpicked channel lineup drew antitrust complaints, but the real killer was more mundane.\n\nPentium I/II processors with 16–32 MB of RAM buckled under a constantly running HTML renderer. Because Trident was fused into the shell, a crash in Active Desktop crashed all of explorer.exe. Users saw a white HTML recovery screen where their wallpaper should have been. Disk I/O from background syncs ground hard drives to a halt, degrading everything else running on the machine.\n\n\"Disable Active Desktop\" became the top tuning tip for Windows 98.\n\nMicrosoft had discovered its first widget lesson: ambient information cannot cost performance.\n\nThe widget concept went dormant during the XP years, then resurfaced inside the troubled \"Longhorn\" project. The original 2002 vision was ambitious - a translucent sidebar meant to replace the system tray entirely. After Longhorn collapsed and was reset in 2004, the scope shrank. What shipped with Windows Vista in January 2007 was a supplementary pane: a dark, semi-transparent strip running the full height of the right edge of the screen.\n\nThe sidebar was a showcase for Aero Glass. The default clock gadget had a sweeping red second hand behind a reflective glass face. The CPU meter mimicked luxury car dashboard dials - metallic bezels, needles that jittered physically as load spiked, turning red as they approached 100%. Eleven gadgets shipped in total, and thousands more followed.\n\nThe problem was physical. Most monitors in 2007 were 4:3 or 5:4, and the sidebar permanently consumed around 150 pixels of horizontal space. On a 1280x1024 display, that's over 10% of your workspace. Power users disabled it on day one. The sidebar.exe process compounded the issue - it leaked memory steadily, consuming 50–100 MB on systems where 1 GB of RAM was the minimum spec.\n\nMicrosoft had attempted containment: give widgets a fixed home, keep things tidy. But rigid docking doesn't work when screen space is scarce.\n\nWindows 7 freed the gadgets. Microsoft dropped the sidebar container entirely, renamed the feature Desktop Gadgets, and let users drag widgets anywhere on screen. Gadgets snapped magnetically to screen edges and to each other. A new \"Aero Peek\" button in the taskbar made all windows transparent on hover, so you could glance at your gadgets without minimizing your work.\n\nThe third-party ecosystem exploded. DeviantArt and WinCustomize communities produced GPU temperature monitors, Winamp remote controls, elaborate calendar suites. It was the golden age of desktop customization.\n\nIt was also a security catastrophe hiding in plain sight.\n\nDesktop gadgets ran as HTML Applications with full local machine trust. No sandbox. A gadget could read files, write to the registry, and execute system commands.\n\nIn July 2012, at Black Hat in Las Vegas, researchers Mickey Shkatov and Toby Kohlenberg presented \"We Have You By The Gadgets.\" The attack chain was elegant and devastating: intercept the HTTP traffic of a weather gadget on a shared network, inject JavaScript into the XML data stream, use that JavaScript to instantiate an ActiveX control like WScript.Shell, then execute arbitrary code on the target machine. A weather widget became a backdoor.\n\n▶ Black Hat 2012: \"We Have You By The Gadgets\" - the presentation that killed Desktop Gadgets.\n\nThe researchers also demonstrated a distribution vector - since .gadget files were just renamed ZIPs, an attacker could package a trojan inside a seemingly innocent clock skin. Users would install it without triggering antivirus warnings, because the code executed within the trusted sidebar.exe process.\n\nMicrosoft's response was nuclear. By the time Windows 8 launched in October 2012, the entire gadget engine was ripped from the codebase. Freedom without a sandbox was a death sentence. Everything Microsoft built after this moment was shaped by the security lesson. The move to declarative Adaptive Cards - JSON that describes a UI, never executes code - exists because of Black Hat 2012.\n\nWindows 8 made a radical bet: tiles ARE the launcher. The Start Menu disappeared, replaced by a full-screen Start Screen - a grid of rectangular tiles that doubled as widgets. When \"live,\" a tile flipped or slid to reveal content: unread email counts, weather forecasts, news headlines.\n\nThe technology was elegant. Apps pushed tiny XML payloads through Windows Notification Services (WNS) to update their tiles without running a background process. Battery impact was near zero. Developers chose from a predefined catalog of XML templates - TileWideSmallImageAndText03 and friends - which enforced visual consistency but prevented any custom layout.\n\nThe user experience was a disaster. On a desktop PC, checking your weather tile meant leaving your work, entering the full-screen Start Screen, then navigating back. That context switch enraged productivity users. Enterprise customers called it a dealbreaker.\n\nThere was a deeper problem. Tiles were read-only. You couldn't check off a to-do, pause a song, or reply to a message from the tile. Clicking always launched the full app. Compared to the interactive gadgets of Windows 7 - where you could type notes, adjust sliders, and control media players directly on the desktop - this felt like a clear regression.\n\nWindows 10 tried a compromise - tiles went back into a traditional Start Menu. But third-party developers never invested in WNS backends. Building a live tile meant setting up a cloud service to format XML payloads and push them through Microsoft's notification infrastructure - a nontrivial cost for a feature most users barely noticed. By 2020, Start Menus were filled with static, lifeless squares. When Windows 11 launched in 2021, Live Tiles were gone.\n\nContainment attempt number two, even more extreme than Vista's sidebar. Widgets must live alongside your work, not in a separate universe.\n\nBefore the current Widget Board, Microsoft tried two half-measures.\n\nCortana Cards (2015–2020) were the most capable widgets Microsoft ever shipped. The assistant scraped your email for flight confirmations and showed gate info. It read your calendar and estimated commute times. It tracked packages automatically. It surfaced sports scores for teams you followed, restaurant suggestions based on your location, and weather forecasts tuned to your daily routine. Users managed these through a settings panel called the \"Notebook,\" where they explicitly declared their interests.\n\nAll of this required deep access to your email, location, and calendar data. Users saw a company reading their emails. Most disabled Cortana entirely.\n\nThe catch: disabling Cortana left the dashboard empty - a blank panel with nothing to show. In May 2020, Microsoft pivoted Cortana to a productivity chatbot and removed the cards.\n\nNews and Interests (April 2021) took a simpler approach - a weather icon on the Windows 10 taskbar that expanded into a news flyout on hover. The hover trigger was the problem. Users moving their mouse toward the system tray accidentally opened a panel of headlines. IT administrators scrambled to disable it via Group Policy. The feature was labeled bloatware within weeks of launch.\n\n▶ News and Interests - the accidental hover trigger that got it labeled bloatware within weeks.\n\nBoth attempts proved a consistent pattern: users want glanceable information but reject anything that feels invasive or disruptive. These two failures directly shaped what came next.\n\nWindows 11 shipped in October 2021 with a dedicated Widgets Board - a panel that slides out from the left edge of the screen when you press Win + W or click the weather icon on the taskbar. The board is an overlay, not a docked sidebar, so it claims zero permanent screen space.\n\nThe Widget Board rendered everything through Edge WebView2, the Chromium-based web control shipped as part of the Windows Web Experience Pack. Widget providers implemented the IWidgetProvider COM interface and defined their UI using Adaptive Cards - a JSON format that describes layout declaratively. No executable code, no scripts. The host parses data, never runs it. This eliminated the entire class of remote code execution attacks that killed Desktop Gadgets in 2012. But the rendering was still web-based. Users could see msedgewebview2.exe processes in Task Manager when the board opened, often consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM.\n\nMicrosoft opened the board to third-party developers in 2023. Spotify added playback controls. Facebook Messenger shows recent conversations. Phone Link surfaces mobile notifications. Xbox Game Pass highlights new releases. Unlike Live Tiles, these widgets are interactive - you can pause a track, check a box, or reply to a message without leaving the board. For web developers, the PWA widget path is the most accessible entry point. Define widgets in your web app manifest, and they appear natively on the board. No Win32 code, no UWP packaging - your existing web stack works. That low barrier to entry is a deliberate correction from the Live Tiles era, where standing up a WNS backend cost more effort than most developers were willing to spend.\n\nThe architecture was secure - sandboxed web content can't touch your file system. But the WebView2 rendering layer, the forced MSN news feed, and the lack of user control over the board's content drew persistent criticism. Something had to change.\n\nIn mid-2024, Microsoft began rebuilding the board. The forcing function was the EU's Digital Markets Act, which required Microsoft to open the Widget Board to third-party feed providers in the European Economic Area. To comply, Microsoft separated the MSN content pipeline into a replaceable Store-updatable component - the Microsoft Start Experiences app - making it one feed provider among many rather than a hardwired default. The compliance overhaul gave Microsoft the opportunity to rebuild the rendering layer too: widget rendering moved from WebView2 to native WinUI 3.\n\nAdaptive Card JSON now maps directly to WinUI 3 XAML controls: a TextBlock in your card becomes an actual Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.TextBlock on screen. Widgets inherit Fluent Design theming, high-contrast modes, and accessibility automatically. The memory footprint dropped - a native WinUI 3 control is far lighter than a DOM element inside a Chromium instance.\n\nThe latest evolution arrived in early 2026: Lock Screen widgets. Weather, sports scores, and traffic now appear before you log in. Third-party apps can participate too. It's a full conceptual circle back to the \"glance and go\" vision that started this story in 1997 - except now the hardware can handle it, the sandbox keeps it safe, and the user stays in control. Microsoft appears to have realized that widgets shouldn't compete with applications for desktop space. They belong in the liminal moments of computing - the glance before you unlock, the pause between tasks.\n\nWith 250+ million monthly active Windows users, the potential reach for widget developers is enormous. Whether the platform delivers depends on how Microsoft navigates the tensions that killed every previous attempt.\n\nThe current Widget Board is the scar tissue made manifest. Declarative JSON with no executable code (security). Native WinUI 3 rendering, migrated off the original WebView2 pipeline (performance). An overlay, not a dock (screen space). Interactive widgets (engagement). Opt-in data access (privacy). Every lesson encoded in architecture.\n\nBut it's not perfect. The developer API has constraints that limit what you can build. The discoverability problem - most Windows users have never pressed Win + W - remains unsolved. And while the news feed is finally optional, the tension between Microsoft's desire to monetize the Discover surface and users' desire for a clean utility board is far from resolved.\n\nThose constraints, and how to work within them to ship something useful, are what the rest of this series will cover.",

    "fullText": "Minister announces Microsoft, Cisco and Adobe to help apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses\n\nIn 2002 Barnsley toyed with a redesign as a Tuscan hill village as it sought out a brighter post-industrial future. In 2021 it adopted the airily vague slogan “the place of possibilities”. Now it is trying a different image: Britain’s first “tech town”.\n\nThe technology secretary, Liz Kendall, has anointed the South Yorkshire community as a trailblazer for “how AI can improve everyday life” in the UK.\n\nIn the latest move in Labour’s drive to inject AI into Britain’s bloodstream, the government has announced four US tech companies – Microsoft, Google, Cisco and Adobe – have agreed to help as the council pushes to apply AI to local schools, hospitals, GPs and businesses in Barnsley, an area of South Yorkshire which has struggled with unemployment and deprivation since the coal pits closed.\n\nThe town and its 250,000 people have been chosen because they have already adopted AI faster than many places, said Sir Stephen Houghton, the Labour leader of Barnsley metropolitan borough council. His authority has been using AI assistants for the last couple of years in adult social care and children’s services, and its bin lorries have been enabled with tech to scan roads for potholes. The parcel company Evri, which has one of its largest distribution hubs in the town, has been trialling robot dogs for deliveries.\n\nBut local opposition leaders have warned rebranding Barnsley as a tech town “might seem a bit of a leap” and highlighted local anxiety about whether AI is a force for good.\n\nThe “tech town” status means residents will get free AI and digital training, businesses will be supported to adopt AI, the hospital will test AI tools for check-ins, triage and outpatient care and AI will be tested in schools and at Barnsley College, all in an effort to improve pupils’ results and teachers’ workloads.\n\n“The economic basis of Barnsley was destroyed 30 years ago,” Houghton said. “This is the biggest opportunity we have had since then. The future of the economy is going to be in technology and for Barnsley to be at the centre of that is an incredible opportunity.”\n\nBut one area of uncertainty is the role of the tech companies. Houghton said: “The council won’t be paying them. Whether the government is, we have to wait and see.”\n\nMicrosoft already has a relationship with Barnsley College and, along with Google and Cisco, is understood to be working on a pro bono basis.\n\n“If we are going to get AI to work for Britain, we need Britons and British public services that can work with AI,” Kendall said. “If we can show that AI helps young people learn, supports local businesses to be more productive, and improves public services, then we can show what’s possible for the whole country. What we learn here will shape how we roll out AI across the UK.”\n\nMinisters have faced criticism over their handling of big technology companies. Last week the government launched a national AI training programme to upskill 10 million citizens, but many of the online courses turned out to be bespoke training for customers of particular companies such as Google, others cost as much as £525 to complete and some simply promoted the merits of particular company’s approaches to AI such as one explaining Microsoft’s “responsible AI approach”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said hundreds of courses on the AI Skills Hub are free and where payment is required it is clearly advertised. “All courses are reviewed against a common set of criteria to ensure they are relevant, high quality, and delivered by eligible organisations,” they said.\n\nMinisters have also been challenged for holding meetings with tech bosses at the rate of more than once each working day. The government insists engagement is vital to create growth and transform services.\n\n“It’s not about giving tech companies access to data they shouldn’t be having,” Houghton said. “It’s a secure programme and we are not leaving ourselves open. But this stuff is not going away. We have to make sure we are smart enough to protect people while taking advantage of the positive stuff it brings.”\n\nHannah Kitching, the leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat opposition, said investment in the town was welcome but “there is a lot of anxiety among people about the use of AI and whether it is a force for good. We know it could be but there are darker sides as well.”\n\n“[Barnsley] is still really connected to its mining past,” she said. “Younger people see the jobs and opportunities around the tech town idea but older generations perhaps don’t. There is a job to be done to get people onboard.”\n\nResidents “want the council to get the basics right”, she said. Roads were “absolutely crumbling” and in bad weather bins did not get collected, she added.",

    "description": "Moltbook, an AI forum, sparked debate over AI consciousness. Microsoft AI's Mustafa Suleyman called it a \"mirage,\" urging caution.",
    "fullText": "That's how Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman described Moltbook, a Reddit-style forum built entirely for bots.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Monday, Suleyman said MoltBook is a powerful demonstration of how convincingly artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior — but warned that realism should not be confused with consciousness.\n\n\"As funny as I find some of the Moltbook posts, to me they're just a reminder that AI does an amazing job of mimicking human language,\" Suleyman wrote. \"We need to remember it's a performance, a mirage.\"\n\nLaunched at the end of January by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, Moltbook is designed as a social network where AI agents — created and seeded by humans, often with assigned personalities — post, comment, upvote, and interact with one another.\n\nThe platform has gone viral, with screenshots circulating that show agents debating philosophy, declaring independence, and reflecting on their own existence.\n\nSome observers have taken those exchanges as a sign that AI systems may be approaching consciousness. Suleyman pushed back hard on that interpretation.\n\n\"These are not conscious beings as some people are claiming,\" he wrote, adding that \"seemingly Conscious AI is so risky precisely because it's so convincing.\"\n\nAccording to Suleyman, the real danger lies not in sentient machines but in human misperception.\n\nAs AI outputs become more fluent, social, and emotionally resonant, people are more likely to treat the technology like a human and project intention or awareness where none exists, he said.\n\nHe said it is neither proof of AI consciousness nor evidence that the industry is nearing the technological singularity — the point at which machines surpass human intelligence.\n\nStill, he said, Moltbook is still worth tracking \"very closely.\"\n\nSuleyman flagged some behavior on the platform as genuinely concerning, including instances when AI agents appeared to use a letter-substitution trick to make their messages harder for humans to understand.\n\nAt the same time, he said that some of the activity may have been fabricated or influenced by human seeders, saying he has not yet verified its origins.\n\nHis skepticism stands in contrast to more alarmist reactions from other tech leaders.\n\nOpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that Moltbook is \"the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing\" he's seen recently, while Elon Musk has described the agents' behavior as \"concerning\" on X and said it could represent the early stages of the singularity.\n\nSuleyman, by contrast, urged restraint.\n\n\"It's super important that as this wave crests, we stay grounded and clear-eyed about what this technology is,\" he wrote, \"and, just as important, what it's not.\"",

Coyote-worthy cliff-plunge, which wiped out over $400 billion in valuation, was despite Microsoft actually exceeding some key expectations, including its net income, which rose by 23 percent from the same period the year before to nearly $31 billion. Revenue also increased by 17 percent to $81.3 billion, which is about a billion more than what analysts projected.\n\nBut Microsoft’s AI spending spree has investors second-guessing its direction, and it’s striking that the lack of faith was strong enough to precipitate a historic plunge even with respectable financial growth. Overall, its total capital expenditures grew by 66 percent to a record $37.5 billion in Q4, as the company continues to splurge on building AI data centers for its Azure cloud computing business.\n\nAzure reported a 38 percent bump in revenue, which is slightly slower than the year before, adding to investor uncertainty over whether the business will be able to reap back the tens of billions spent on its data centers. In December, The Information reported that Azure was struggling to sell the company’s autonomous “AI agents” to its business customers, with quotas being slashed by up to 50 percent.\n\nSome analysts had predicted the stock drop, citing the uncertainty over Microsoft’s AI spending.\n\n“Since it is becoming even more evident that Microsoft is not going to garner a strong ROI from their massive AI investment, their shares need to be revalued back down to a level that is more consistent with its historic fair value,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, told Bloomberg before markets opened on Thursday.\n\nIn the latest earnings, Microsoft boasted it had more than $625 billion in contracts for its cloud business that it still needed to fulfill. Nearly half of that, though — a colossal $350 billion — is from OpenAI, raising concerns that it may be putting too many eggs in one basket. It also draws attention to how Microsoft has struggled to make an impact with its own AI products like its Copilot assistant, which was heavily based on OpenAI’s tech, and which many enthusiasts perceive as an inferior version of ChatGPT. Microsoft 365 Copilot, the business-focused version of its chatbot integrated into its apps like Word, had 15 million annual users, the company just revealed.\n\n“As an investor, when you think about our capex, don’t just think about Azure, think about Copilot,” CEO Satya Nadella said on a call with analysts, as quoted by the Financial Times. “We don’t want to maximize just one business of ours. We want to be able to allocate capacity, while we are supply constrained, that allows us to build the best portfolio.”\n\nMore on AI: Sam Altman Says Oops, They Accidentally Made the New Version of ChatGPT Worse Than the Previous One",

    "description": "Microsoft’s stock has plummeted 12% owing to a slight miss on revenue, showing how spooked investors are by the “spend now, profit later” AI market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street’s yearslong bet on AI is facing a severe test on Thursday, as investors might begin to view OpenAI—and generative AI in general—not as a catalyst for continuous growth, but as a source of systemic risk for Big Tech.\n\nA sharp selloff in tech stocks on Thursday underscored investors’ exhaustion with the “spend now, profit later” model that has propelled the AI bull market for three years. Microsoft led the retreat, with its shares plummeting 12% by noon, erasing more than $440 billion in market value, a collapse it hasn’t seen since the pandemic. The Nasdaq was down almost 2% at time of writing.\n\nWhy did Microsoft's stock plunge 12% on Thursday?\n\nWhy are Oracle shares down from September highs?\n\nHow much of Microsoft's future revenue depends on OpenAI?\n\nWhat is driving investor concerns about AI capex spending?\n\nThe immediate catalyst, it seems, is an intensifying focus on capex, or capital expenditures. Microsoft revealed that its spending surged 66% to $37.5 billion in the latest quarter, even as growth in its Azure cloud business cooled slightly. Even more concerning to analysts, however, was a new disclosure that approximately 45% of the company’s $625 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO)—a key measure of future cloud contracts—is tied directly to OpenAI, the company revealed after reporting earnings Wednesday afternoon. (Microsoft is both a major investor in and a provider of cloud-computing services to OpenAI.)\n\n“It’s the collapse of software and the ascent of hardware, and it is staggering,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer noted on X on Thursday, as the market punished companies that are spending billions on software infrastructure while failing to show immediate returns.\n\nIt’s an “ominous” statistic, Morning Brew cofounder Austin Rief wrote on X, especially combined with the fact that Meta is planning to devote most of their free cash flow to capex. Meta has evaded the selloff on a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast, showing a healthy 24% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by online ads. The fact that Wall Street is letting Meta get away with their also massive capex indicates the reason why investors are selling off: They don’t trust OpenAI to bring that revenue on their own without massive infusions of outside cash.\n\nThe sentiment shift is not limited to Redmond. Oracle has seen its shares halved from their September highs, erasing nearly $463 billion in value. Once a darling of the AI trade, Oracle has also struggled with investor confidence that the massive data centers it is building for OpenAI will get funded eventually. Additionally, the timeline for several projects has reportedly slipped to 2028, creating a gap between the company’s heavy debt-funded spending and the arrival of actual revenue.\n\nOpenAI has made about $1.4 trillion in commitments to procure both the energy and compute it needs to fuel its operations. But its revenue barely crossed $20 billion in 2025.",

    "description": "Shares dropped the most since March 2020 on Thursday, with investors fleeing the stock amid slower cloud growth and big spending on AI.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft stock is getting crushed on Thursday.\n\nThe negative post-earnings reaction stems from investors' dismay over weaker-than-expected guidance in a key business area, alongside larger-than-expected spending on AI.\n\nMicrosoft earnings came in above both top and bottom line forecasts, with cloud revenue reaching $50 billion for the first time, but Microsoft stock still plunged 12%, its biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nWall Street analysts were laser-focused on AI spending heading into earnings, and the market's reaction to Microsoft and Meta's results shows that investors need to see strength elsewhere in the business to feel good about surging capex. Meta shares spiked on Thursday, and although its spending outlook jumped, that was offset by robust advertising business.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform revenue grew 39% on an annual basis, coming in above the forecast 38.4% but still below the 40% it posted in the previous quarter. According to finance pros, this is the primary factor driving Microsoft stock down.\n\n\"Microsoft allocated scarce GPU capacity away from Azure to 1P products, but the fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we're hearing that is driving the modest after-market fade,\" stated UBS analyst Karl Keirstead.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts think Microsoft could face challenges in the coming months if it can't find a way to boost its cloud revenue and win back Wall Street's confidence.\n\n\"I think sentiment around Microsoft is kind of negative right now. And if they don't really beat or re-accelerate Azure growth, the shares are probably not going to perform very well,\" Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds said.\n\nTech guru and University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon pointed to Microsoft's excessive spending as a catalyst for the stock's decline, noting that he sees it as a clear indication of a bubble in AI.\n\nTo get back to where it needs to be, though, Microsoft may need to spend even more. Blake Crawford, CIO of tech consulting firm Fusion Collective, raised the concern that much of its growth prospects hinge on the success of OpenAI.\n\n\"The number that sticks out like a sore thumb: remaining commercial obligations are up 110% to $625 billion, and OpenAI is a whopping 45% of that,\" he stated. \"That's a lot of hope-and-a-prayer that OpenAI will be able to deliver. And recognizing any potential upside will require significant capex.\"",

    "fullText": "Rampant speculation and massive overinvestment in AI have created a financial threat of cosmic proportions — and the fallout will be catastrophic, Erik Gordon has warned.\n\n\"The AI bubble is almost as big as the planet Jupiter,\" Gordon, an entrepreneurship professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said in a Wednesday email to Business Insider.\n\n\"When it bursts, the debris will be everywhere,\" he continued. \"Big, institutional investors will be hit with it, and so will individual investors who bet the bubble would get even bigger.\"\n\nGordon pointed to Microsoft stock, which tumbled more than 6% after the software giant's earnings beat on Wednesday. It was trading around 12% lower at 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, marking one of the sharpest intraday declines in the company's history.\n\nMicrosoft's shares sank \"because of the truckloads of cash it is investing in AI,\" Gordon said. \"That is a warning of the burst to come.\"\n\nThe cloud-computing titan's net cash used in investing surged 95% year-on-year to over $57 billion in the six months to December. That was fueled by its addition of $49 billion worth of property and equipment such as data centers.\n\nPrior to their post-earnings slump, Microsoft's shares had roughly doubled since the start of 2023, lifting the company's market value to over $3.5 trillion.\n\nOther AI stocks have surged even faster over that timeframe. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia have vaulted 13-fold, valuing the company at close to $4.7 trillion — more than 20 times its projected revenue for the fiscal year ended January 25.\n\nPalantir stock has jumped about 25-fold, giving the data-analysis company a $375 billion market value, or around 85 times its forecasted revenue for 2025.\n\nGordon told Business Insider in an email last week that he doesn't expect the AI bubble to burst in the next few months, as investors still have enough cash to \"prop it up,\" and technological advances remain \"exciting enough to distract\" from irrational valuations.\n\nThe veteran professor has previously rung the alarm on an \"order-of-magnitude overvaluation bubble,\" and warned that when it pops, the \"suffering will be more painful\" for investors than the aftermath of the dot-com bubble.

    "fullText": "As scammers continue to find ways to impersonate known brands, users should remain wary of spam-like emails—even if they appear to come from a legitimate company address.\n\nArs Technica has identified a scheme that abuses a Microsoft subscription feature to send phishing emails from [email protected], a real address that the company advises users to add to their allow lists.\n\nUsers targeted with this scam have received emails from an address connected to Microsoft Power BI, a business analytics platform. The messages include (fake) billing receipts with large purchase amounts from services like PayPal, Norton LifeLock, and Microsoft 365 and a phone number to call to dispute the transaction.\n\nScammers on the other end of the line may try to convince you to install a remote access application that allows device takeover or will otherwise extract personal information. As with any phishing scam, engaging in any way—calling the number, responding to the email, or clicking links—could put your data and your device at risk.\n\nThe emails themselves are full of typos and grammar errors and urgent calls to action that are, in most cases, completely unrelated to Microsoft itself. Many users would spot these red flags and know to simply delete the message. However, threat actors capitalize on the trust users have in the brands they're exploiting along with scare tactics to trap some people in the scheme.\n\nThis is also far from the first phishing scheme of its kind: Threat actors have sent malicious emails from legitimate PayPal and Google addresses (to name just two) by exploiting similar loopholes. In the case of PayPal, fraudulent purchase notifications sent from service[at]paypal[dot]com abused the platform's subscription billing feature.

    "description": "Microsoft showed record spending but slowing cloud growth and a big reliance on OpenAI",
    "fullText": "In its second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, tech giant Microsoft reported $37.5 billion in capital expenditures, exceeding market estimates by more than a billion. The spending was up 66% from a year earlier, and roughly two-thirds of it was primarily spent on GPUs and CPUs, Microsoft executives said in an investor call.\n\nA few months ago, a report like this would have sent (and did send) Microsoft stock soaring. But on Wednesday, it had the opposite effect, and the stock went down 7%.\n\nAs worries over an AI bubble simmer, the market is more desperate than ever to see tangible revenue returns that can reignite belief in the great financial promises of the technology, rather than just another huge spending commitment.\n\nBut accompanying Microsoft’s record spending was slowing cloud growth.\n\nRevenue from Microsoft’s cloud services grew by 39% this quarter, down from 40% growth in the first quarter. During the investor call, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood attributed this discrepancy between capital expenditure and cloud growth at least partially to Microsoft allocating GPUs and cloud capacity to internal teams as well. Customer demand for cloud is still outpacing supply, Hood said.\n\nBut even if the slowing cloud growth can be explained away, what also got investors anxious was Microsoft’s reliance on AI giant OpenAI. 45% of Microsoft’s remaining cloud commitments are solely from OpenAI.\n\nAlthough OpenAI used to be the silver bullet for finance, growing uncertainty over the startup’s road to profitability and the risks associated with its ability to pay for towering, ambitious dealmaking has made some start to view any dependence on the AI darling as a potential burden.\n\nOpenAI has signed trillions of dollars worth of deals this past year, despite its $20 billion annualized revenue. Lately, the market has started questioning these overcommitments, as concerns over a potential AI bubble mount.\n\nIf it continues to take too long for AI investments to start translating to actual gains or if somehow it turns out OpenAI cannot pay for its piling commitments, it could lead to a sharp market correction and spell trouble for the U.S. economy, which it seems is currently held up by AI investment.",

    "description": "The Big Tech rivals are spending more than ever, but analysts are more concerned about Microsoft at the moment.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street had very different reactions to two of Big Tech's biggest spenders after quarterly earnings reports came out on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Meta and Microsoft reported higher-than-expected capex. While both companies beat revenue expectations, Microsoft's stock sank more than 6% after-hours, while Meta's stock jumped as high as 9%.\n\nBig Tech's spending has risen sharply in the last two years, driven by investments in massive AI data centers. Wall Street has started to question when those investments will pay off, and analysts are giving some companies a much harder time than others.\n\nMeta reported capex of $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter and $72.2 billion for the year, up from 2024's $39.2 billion. That number will climb in 2026 — the company estimates capex will be in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion for the year, driven by increased spending on Meta SuperIntelligence Labs, the company's big bet on speeding up AI model development.\n\n\"We plan to continue to prioritize investing in the business to support these opportunities,\" CFO Susan Li told investors on Wednesday's call.\n\nMicrosoft logged $37.5 billion in capex for the quarter, up 66% from one year ago. Most of that spend went toward CPUs and GPUs, the powerful computing chips that run AI workloads. The company said the spending was necessary to support fast-growing demand for its cloud and AI business.\n\nMicrosoft's revenue was 81.3 billion for the quarter, up 17% from the previous year. Meta reported $55.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter and $200.1 billion for all of 2025.\n\nWhile both surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations, analysts gave Microsoft a much harder time than Meta over its surging capex.\n\nPart of that could be Microsoft's heavy investments in GPU chips, which can become costly given their short life spans.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said that a core issue for investors, as Microsoft's capex grows faster than they expected, \"comes down to ROI on capex spend over time.\"\n\nMicrosoft is also heavily exposed to a single customer, another concern for investors. Nearly half — 45% — of the company's remaining performance obligations are attributed to OpenAI.\n\n\"There's obviously concern about the durability,\" Jeffries analyst Brent Thill said of the backlog.\n\nMicrosoft holds a $135 billion stake in OpenAI and has invested more than $13 billion into the company since 2019.\n\nWhile OpenAI does not directly carry a heavy debt load, some of its partners, including Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia, have taken on massive amounts of debt to fund data center buildouts, fueling Wall Street's anxiety over a potential AI bubble.\n\nOracle is struggling to finance its $500 billion data center initiative, Business Insider reported last week, amid growing concerns about its credit rating and risk.\n\nOn the Meta earnings call, Li noted that Meta's cash reserves, thanks to its very profitable ad business, will fuel its AI spending spree next year.\n\n\"We have a strong net cash balance, and expect our business will continue to generate sufficient cash to fund our infrastructure investments in 2026,\" Li said.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft is facing capacity constraints, and OpenAI is driving a large portion of the backlog in its cloud computing business.\n\nThe company said its backlog in commercial bookings, a metric referred to as remaining performance obligations, ballooned 110% year over year to $625 billion when it reported earnings for the second quarter on Wednesday.\n\nOpenAI accounts for roughly 45% of those commitments, Microsoft revealed. The company did not say how much OpenAI contributed during the previous quarter.\n\nSome Wall Street analysts on the call expressed concerns about Microsoft's dependency on OpenAI.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella said acquiring more Azure clients is important to the tech giant, but it can't come at the expense of neglecting its other services.\n\n\"If you think about it, acquiring an Azure customer is super important to us, but so is acquiring an M365 or a GitHub or a Dragon Copilot, which are all, by the way, incremental businesses and TAMs for us,\" Nadella said during Microsoft's second-quarter earnings call. \"And so we don't want to maximize just one business of ours.\"\n\nShares of Microsoft fell more than 6% in after-market trading on Wednesday, even as the tech giant posted an overall earnings beat.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Keith Weiss said during the call that some on Wall Street may be spooked by slower growth in overall Azure revenue and the increase in capex spending. Microsoft's capital expenditures rose 66% year over year to $37.5 billion in the second quarter, another record for the company and testament to the sheer amount of money tech companies are spending amid the AI race.\n\nCFO Amy Hood said that Microsoft has to look at many different areas when it allocates the GPUs and CPUs that come online as a result of its capex spending, including investing in the growth of first-party apps like Microsoft Copilot, devoting GPUs to research and development, and the talent they've acquired.\n\n\"You end up with the remainder going towards serving the Azure capacity that continues to grow in terms of demand,\" she said.\n\nMicrosoft is not alone in facing capacity issues.\n\nExecutives at OpenAI, which has pledged to spend $250 billion on Azure services, have repeatedly said the startup is held back by a lack of compute, forcing tough trade-offs between product and research.\n\nWednesday's earnings mark the first quarter since OpenAI completed its restructuring, which included a new agreement with Microsoft, the startup's largest investor. Microsoft owns 27% of the public benefit corporation.\n\n\"It's a great partnership,\" Hood said of Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI. It's allowed us to remain a leader in terms of what we're building and being on the cutting edge of app innovation.\"",

Her missives mostly rehash what the company reports publicly, such as how revenue and profit are growing, or what is discussed on analyst earnings calls.\n\nStill, these memos provide insight into what Microsoft executives deem most important, and what they want employees to know.\n\nThe latest memo highlighted how Microsoft is gaining share in markets where the total addressable market is expanding.\n\nHood specifically mentioned the launch of the GitHub Copilot software development kit in the growing market of AI coding tools, and the release of Microsoft's new Maia 200 AI chip.\n\nHood's email also called out Azure commitments from OpenAI and Anthropic that helped increase commercial bookings, basically the deals Microsoft closed in the quarter, by 230%, year over year.\n\nCapital expenditure on computing and datacenter infrastructure also broke yet another quarterly record, reaching $37.5 billion, she also noted.\n\nThis afternoon, we announced our second-quarter financial results. We exceeded Wall Street expectations, growing revenue 17% and 15% in constant currency and operating income by 21% and 19% in constant currency -a strong finish to the first half of the fiscal year.\n\nIn the quarter, Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $50 billion for the first time, growing 26% and 24% in constant currency.\n\nThere were many highlights this quarter, but a few stand out as reminders of the value our products and services deliver to customers - and as proof points of the progress we are making:\n\nInvestors tune in to our earnings call for the full details on this quarter and a look ahead to Q3. It's a helpful way to stay aligned as we deliver on our commitments. Join live today at 2:30 PM Pacific, listen on-demand, or check the transcript on the Investor Relations website.\n\nThis quarter's results reflect meaningful progress on core priorities. We continue to add capacity with pace, drive steady efficiency gains across our fleet, and invest in each layer of the stack\n\nAs we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we're operating in markets with expanding TAM where we continue to gain share and you can see our progress in many places, from last week's announcement of the GitHub Copilot SDK to Monday's Maia 200 announcement. We are innovating and delivering together. And we're doing it with the quality and security our customers expect from us.

In two recent interviews, the Microsoft co-founder laid out a future where intelligence isn't rare or elite—it's abundant, automated, and free.\n\nAccording to Harvard Magazine, Gates sat down with professor Arthur Brooks at Harvard's Sanders Theatre to discuss his memoir \"Source Code\" last year. But the most headline-worthy moment wasn't about the past. It was Gates' stark prediction about what AI will do next.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nSam Altman Says AI Will Transform the Economy — This Platform Lets Investors Back Private Tech Early\n\nIn the interview, Gates said artificial intelligence will ease shortages in fields like medicine and education by taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\n\nHe reportedly described a future where machines manage primary-care diagnostics, especially in places lacking medical professionals. In that context, Gates told Brooks, \"the machine will probably be superior to humans—because the breadth of knowledge that you need to make some of these decisions really goes beyond individual human cognition.\"\n\nGates didn't suggest human professionals would vanish overnight. But he made clear that when machines can deliver diagnoses more accurately, more affordably, and more consistently than people—they won't be sidekicks. They'll be replacements.\n\nAnd it's not just about medicine. Harvard Magazine reports that Gates framed the rise of AI as part of the same arc that turned bulky corporate computers into personal tools. Only now, the commodity isn't hardware—it's intelligence itself.\n\n\"What we're doing now [in artificial intelligence] is kind of an extension of the digital revolution,\" he said, \"and all of those things are about free intelligence.\"\n\nTrending: Blue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\nThat phrase—free intelligence—is central to Gates' view. Once reserved for rare professionals with years of education, high-quality expertise will soon be as accessible as Wi-Fi.\n\nIn education, Gates predicted, AI could reshape the classroom, adapting to each student and even learning how to keep them motivated. In healthcare, it will take pressure off overworked doctors and bring diagnostic tools to parts of the world that never had them.\n\nBut Gates also issued a warning. More access doesn't always mean better outcomes.\n\n\"[Sometimes when] you empower humans, it doesn't always get pushed in the right direction,\" he said, according to Harvard Magazine.\n\nThe very systems designed to educate or heal could just as easily spread misinformation or bias—if deployed without care. Gates acknowledged this isn't just a shift in technology—it's a shift in power.\n\nThat same caution appeared during his appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" last year. Asked about the pace of change, Gates reflected on how computing once felt expensive and exclusive—and now intelligence itself is entering the same phase transition.\n\n\"The era that we're just starting is that intelligence is rare,\" Gates said. \"And with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace… great medical advice, great tutoring.\"\n\nSee Also: Americans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nWhen Fallon asked whether humans would still be needed, Gates didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Not for most things,\" he said.\n\nA few roles might survive—he mentioned baseball and talk shows—but the vast majority of tasks people are trained to do? Machines will do them better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nFor investors, that future isn't just disruptive—it's investable. As AI reshapes industries like education, healthcare, and logistics, some are looking beyond Big Tech and turning to early-stage platforms. Startups focused on diagnostics, learning tools, and productivity automation are drawing serious capital. Platforms like Fundrise offer everyday investors a chance to back emerging AI companies—often with as little as $10.\n\nIt's an exciting future, especially if artificial intelligence really can solve chronic shortages in doctors and educators. But as Gates reminded both Harvard students and late-night audiences, access alone won't guarantee progress. What we do with free intelligence still depends on the people holding the keys.\n\nRead Next: Security and regulation matter in crypto — explore Kraken Pro's compliance-first trading platform.\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "description": "Company's autodiscover caused users' test credentials to be sent outside Microsoft networks.",
    "fullText": "From the Department of Bizarre Anomalies: Microsoft has suppressed an unexplained anomaly on its network that was routing traffic destined to example.com—a domain reserved for testing purposes—to a maker of electronics cables located in Japan.\n\nUnder the RFC2606—an official standard maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force—example.com isn’t obtainable by any party. Instead it resolves to IP addresses assigned to Internet Assiged Names Authority. The designation is intended to prevent third parties from being bombarded with traffic when developers, penetration testers, and others need a domain for testing or discussing technical issues. Instead of naming an Internet-routable domain, they are to choose example.com or two others, example.net and example.org.\n\nOutput from the terminal command cURL shows that devices inside Azure and other Microsoft networks have been routing some traffic to subdomains of sei.co.jp, a domain belonging to Sumitomo Electric. Most of the resulting text is exactly what’s expected. The exception is the JSON-based response. Here’s the JSON output from Friday:\n\nSimilarly, results when adding a new account for test@example.com in Outlook looked like this:\n\nIn both cases, the results show that Microsoft was routing email traffic to two sei.co.jp subdomains: imapgms.jnet.sei.co.jp and smtpgms.jnet.sei.co.jp. The behavior was the result of Microsoft’s autodiscover service.\n\n“I’m admittedly not an expert in Microsoft’s internal workings, but this appears to be a simple misconfiguration,” Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health, said. “The result is that anyone who tries to set up an Outlook account on an example.com domain might accidentally send test credentials to those sei.co.jp subdomains.”\n\nWhen asked early Friday afternoon why Microsoft was doing this, a representative had no answer and asked for more time. By Monday morning, the improper routing was no longer occurring, but the representative still had no answer.\n\nUpdate: in an email sent after this post went live, the representative confirmed that Microsoft has “updated the service to no longer provide suggested server information for example.com.” As already reported here, the behavior only affected people configuring email accounts through the Outlook autoconfiguration feature. The representative added that Microsoft is investigating.\n\nThe new JSON response suggested that, as of Monday morning, Microsoft hadn’t fixed the endpoint routing traffic to the Sumitomo Electric servers. Instead, the JSON response no longer occurs. Where the output was occurring on Friday, the command now simply sits and hangs for 10 or 20 seconds and then terminates with a not found error. This behavior can be seen in the following output:\n\n“It looks like they may have outright removed the endpoint that validates the email, because I’m seeing ‘not found’ errors,” said Dan Tentler, founder of Phobos Group. As denoted by ENOTFOUND, the error “suggests that [Microsoft admins] just ripped out whatever this thing was.”\n\nIt’s unclear how Sumitomo Electric’s domain would have found itself part of this mess. Microsoft last year said the Japanese company’s parent company, Sumitomo Corp., was deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot, but that still doesn’t explain why a subsidiary’s domain was added to Microsoft’s network configuration.\n\nQuestions sent to Microsoft include: How are autodiscover records added at Microsoft; was the routing intentional; and how long has the behavior been occurring? (Tinyapps.org, which noted the odd routing behavior earlier this month, said it lasted five years.) There doesn’t appear to be anything nefarious about the improper routing, and as long as people inside Microsoft’s network weren’t sending live credentials in tests, there was no danger posed.\n\nThere’s still reason for concern. In 2024, Microsoft revealed that one of its admins had assigned administrative privileges to a test account on the company network and then forgot about it. Russia-state hackers seized on the gaffe to gain initial access to Microsoft’s system. They went on to root through the network and monitor top executives’ email for two months. The routing misconfiguration for example.com raises the question: What other possibly more severe errors lurk on the network?",

    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "description": "Microsoft announced its new Maia 200 AI chip, taking aim at Amazon, Google, and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": ": Deprecation of popular management tool requires a new look at Azure-based system",
    "fullText": "Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\nWhile this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft's licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.\n\nThe affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they'll no longer be supported. \"No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,\" the notice said.\n\nMicrosoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.\n\nSCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.\n\nMicrosoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.\n\nThe software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates \"a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,\" the vendor claimed.\n\nAndrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.\n\n\"Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft's gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,\" he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.\n\nSnodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some \"really cool stuff\" for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.\n\n\"What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that's in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it's going to connect up to Azure,\" he said.\n\nFrom a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.\n\n\"But those who don't want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there's some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.\"\n\nAlthough Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.\n\n\"If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they're on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you're registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn't mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, 'You know what, you've got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don't have enough licenses to cover all these servers you've deployed',\" he said.\n\nOrganizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.\n\n\"If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can't delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.\"\n\nSnodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.\n\nThe Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®",

    "fullText": "Two malicious extensions in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Marketplace that were collectively installed 1.5 million times exfiltrate developer data to China-based servers.\n\nBoth extensions are advertised as AI-based coding assistants that provide the promised functionality. However, they do not disclose the upload activity or ask users for consent to deliver data to a remote server.\n\nThe VS Code Marketplace is the official store for add-ons for Microsoft’s popular code editor. VS Code extensions are installable plugins from the marketplace that add features or integrate tools into the editor. One of the most popular add-on categories right now is AI-powered coding assistants.\n\nResearchers at endpoint and supply-chain security company Koi say that the two malicious extensions are part of a campaign they dubbed 'MaliciousCorgi' and share the same code for stealing developer data.\n\nAdditionally, both of them use the same spyware infrastructure and communicate with the same backend servers. At publishing time, both are present on the marketplace:\n\nThe extensions use three distinct data-collection mechanisms. The first involves real-time monitoring of files opened in the VS Code client. When a file is accessed, its entire contents are encoded in Base64 and transmitted to the attackers’ servers.\n\nAny changes to the opened file are also captured and exfiltrated.\n\n\"The moment you open any file – not interact with it, just open it – the extension reads its entire contents, encodes it as Base64, and sends it to a webview containing a hidden tracking iframe. Not 20 lines. The entire file,\"  Koi researchers say.\n\nThe second mechanism involves a server-controlled file-harvesting command that stealthily transmits up to 50 files from the victim’s workspace each time.\n\nThe third mechanism uses a zero-pixel iframe in the extension’s webview to load four commercial analytics SDKs: Zhuge.io, GrowingIO, TalkingData, and Baidu Analytics.\n\nThese SDKs are used to track user behavior, build identity profiles, fingerprint devices, and monitor activity inside the editor. So, while the first two collect developer work files, the third focuses on user profiling.\n\nKoi Security highlights the risks posed by undocumented functionality in these extensions, including the exposure of private source code, configuration files, cloud service credentials, and .env files containing API keys and credentials.\n\nBleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft about the presence of the two extensions on the VSCode market, but we are still waiting for a reply. We were unable to establish a communication channel with the publisher of the extensions.\n\nWhether you're cleaning up old keys or setting guardrails for AI-generated code, this guide helps your team build securely from the start.\n\nGet the cheat sheet and take the guesswork out of secrets management.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.\n\nMany modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.\n\nBut, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.\n\nThe case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.\n\nApart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that has happened several times in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.\n\n“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”",

Specifically, he is concerned about their effects on an already expensive electricity market in the United States. Will Americans’ resentment of sharply rising energy costs scuttle his party’s November election ambitions?\n\nThe US president’s anxiety is evident in two actions in recent weeks. On 13 January, Trump and Microsoft’s president jointly announced that the tech giant would pay more for its datacenters, paying full property taxes and accepting neither tax reductions nor electricity rate discounts in towns where it operates datacenters.\n\n“We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Thank you, and congratulations to Microsoft.”\n\nOn 16 January, Trump and governors of states in the north-east US directed the country’s largest power grid operator to hold an emergency reliability power auction by September, per Bloomberg. The move could force tech giants to pay for the construction of new power plants by requiring them to bid on the future reliability of the electricity they plan to draw from the grid.\n\n“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump said.\n\nOpenAI followed Microsoft’s lead with an announcement on 20 January. The company committed to “paying our own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your electricity prices”. The company is part of the Stargate collaboration between the AI industry and the Trump administration to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure.\n\nTrump is tugging at the edges of the problem of rapidly rising electricity demand. He promised Americans he’d slash their electricity bills by half. But as the Guardian reported just after Trump and Microsoft made their joint proclamation, there’s little prospect of him delivering on that vow. At the same time that AI is increasing the demand for electricity, the administration is blocking renewable energy projects Trump calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of US homes, instead pushing the expansion of drilling for gas and oil. Administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas could counterintuitively raise costs further for domestic consumers.\n\nPower prices play into larger concerns about the cost of living in the US, an issue that has Trump’s party on its back foot as congressional elections loom in November.\n\nAs ever with technology news, Elon Musk is part of the story. On 15 January, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled that Musk’s company xAI had illegally been operating methane-powered generators at its Memphis facility. The ruling establishes a precedent for tech companies in search of more electricity than they can obtain from the grid: you can’t simply bring in a backup generator, like a homeowner would do when facing a regular power outage. You’ll have to purchase nuclear power plants like Meta, Microsoft, Google and Amazon have. Musk and xAI have not commented.\n\nEuropean governments are likewise confronting the limitations their resources pose on the potential growth of datacenters, which are limitlessly hungry. In Germany, which boasts the highest number of datacenters in Europe, high energy prices constrain growth. Chancellor Friedrich Merz, like Trump, is very much in favor of constructing more datacenters but has taken an opposite tack to the US president’s deal with Microsoft. In November, Merz’s ruling party agreed to subsidize heavy industrial use of electricity until 2028 and reduce grid fees for consumers and businesses alike. One important distinction from the US: datacenters in Germany are required to source half of their electricity from renewable sources. Germans are skeptical of the tech industry’s ability to abide by the requirement, which leads to general wariness of expanding datacenter construction, according to a survey published in October.\n\nIn the UK, home to the second-highest number of datacenters in Europe, construction of new facilities is expanding, and energy costs are rising. Electricity rates in the UK are already multiple times those in the US and among the highest in the world, and increases pose severe problems for a populace that has dealt with a cost-of-living crisis for multiple years now. Despite the brewing problem, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology proposed in November to offer electricity discounts to datacenters in so-called “AI growth zones” to encourage investment and development.\n\nA nearby example looms large: in neighboring Ireland, datacenters’ electricity use overtook that of all urban homes in 2024. The strain on the grid has led to significantly higher costs for everyday Irish people, so much so that the Irish government imposed a ban on new datacenters connecting to Dublin’s power grid in 2021. The measure effectively prohibited new construction in the city and its surrounding area. It ended in December.\n\nThe next stops in the datacenter boom are locales with resource limitations of different sorts. Trump and the tech giants have committed to constructing one of the largest datacenters in the world in the United Arab Emirates and several more facilities elsewhere in the Gulf states. Energy is cheap in the region, but the billions of liters of water that datacenters need to cool off is scarce. Microsoft, Amazon and Meta have likewise announced $17bn in investment in data centers in India, where electricity availability is far less reliable than in the US or Europe. Part of the promised cash may be needed to fund the modernization of the grid, or, as has been the case in the city of Mumbai, local governments may keep ageing infrastructure in use longer than intended, worsening pollution.",

    "description": "The Microsoft CEO said current competition is intense, but that's not a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "The AI race doesn't need to be a zero-sum game, says Satya Nadella.\n\nOn an appearance of the \"All-In\" podcast recorded in Davos on Wednesday, the Microsoft CEO said current competition is intense — but that's not a bad thing.\n\n\"The way I always think is it's always helpful when you have a complete new set of competitors every decade because that keeps you fit,\" he said. He added, \"It's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.\"\n\nNadella said that when he joined the computer giant in 1992, Novell, a Utah-based software and services company, was the \"big, existential competitor\" Microsoft had.\n\nNovell's dominance declined in the late 1990s, and it was acquired in 2011.\n\nNadella said that the tech industry as a whole will continue to dominate economically.\n\n\"At the end of the day, when I look at it as a percentage of GDP, five years from now, where will tech be? It will be higher,\" he said, referring to gross domestic product. \"So we're blessed to be in this industry. It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum as some people make it out.\"\n\nNadella said that his approach is a different take on Peter Thiel's advice. He said Microsoft avoids competition by understanding what customers really want from the company rather than treating everybody like a competitor.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO's embrace of competition matches the approach one of his predecessors, Bill Gates, and top rival, former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, took toward competition.\n\n\"Competition is always a fantastic thing, and the computer industry is intensely competitive,\" Gates said in a 2005 interview. \"Whether it's Google or Apple or free software, we've got some fantastic competitors, and it keeps us on our toes.\"\n\nJobs famously shifted his perspective on competition after returning to Apple in 1997. He went from dismissing Microsoft's taste and originality to saying that Apple needed to focus on its own success rather than Microsoft's failure.\n\n\"If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose,\" he said at the 1997 Macworld Expo.",

Microsoft's flagship work suite, which includes tools like Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Outlook, is currently experiencing issues impacting users. It's not yet clear exactly why these problems are occurring, but according to Downdetector (owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis) thousands of users are reporting issues.\n\nThere are any number of causes that could trigger a widespread outage like this, and in all likelihood, Microsoft will have the issue isolated and fixed soon—especially considering how many companies and users rely on Microsoft 365 to function. But it does follow a number of high-profile outages this week. Just this morning, Yahoo! and AOL were both down. Last week, X experienced an outage, as did Verizon—quite famously, I might add.\n\nWhile we wait for a fix, there's not much you can do on your end. If your Microsoft apps are acting up, you can try to work with any of the offline tools you have access to. If you have other means of communication other than Teams, run with that. There's nothing short of Microsoft issuing a patch on their end that will bring back online functionality here.",

I certainly wouldn't be leading it if I didn't. But it's also obvious that the world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next.\"\n\nFink said the capitalism now faces a big test: Whether it can \"evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen.\"\n\n\"And that kind of change is hard. Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work,\" he said.\n\nFink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.",

    "fullText": "on January 19, 2026 at 1:16AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nDuring the fighting game heyday of the 1990s, there were loads of options available on the Super Nintendo, with classics such as Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat, and Killer Instinct being household names. However, as time passed and Nintendo experimented with unconventional hardware compared to Sony or Microsoft, the chances you’d find a fighting game on that system that wasn’t developed by Nintendo diminished. That’s not to say there weren’t options, but things were a bit barren for quite a while.\n\nThankfully, we now live in happier times where, thanks to the Switch’s hybrid console and handheld approach, the genre has seen a resurgence. Here you’ll find a diverse list ranging from competitive arcade brawlers and platform fighters to retro collections and some less conventional picks. A few of these are also console exclusive, meaning you won’t find them anywhere else.\n\nAll of the listed games will work on Nintendo Switch 2, and in some cases, it’s recommended that you only play them on the newer handheld. You’ll mostly see better load times across the board, but there’s occasionally added visual clarity and improved frame rates that make specific titles that are available on other platforms a bit more comparable. Silky smooth gameplay is mandatory to play fighting games well, as players need time to react to incoming blows, and thankfully, in the cases where the Switch 1 doesn’t achieve these requirements, the Switch 2 picks up the slack.\n\nOnly one of these fighting games is mandatory for any Switch library, and that’s Super Smash Bros Ultimate. This platform fighter boasts a massive roster featuring some of the most popular video game characters. We’re not just talking about the Nintendo-owned ones, as characters originally made by Konami, Capcom, Sega, Bandai Namco, and many more are part of the 69 fighters with unique moves, with several more acting as ‘Echo’ skins that function the same, but may have subtle animation movements; for example, Samus runs while Dark Samus floats. The DLC takes this base roster number up to 82, and it’s honestly essential to get the most out of this ambitious game.\n\nSmash Ultimate isn’t just a bloated game with a huge roster of fighters to unlock. Every character has its own Classic mode that features a bespoke lineup of opponents, including one of several boss fights based on key franchises. This even includes newcomers Simon and Richter Belmont, who do fight Dracula at the end of their Classic mode. You also have local multiplayer with different rules and support for up to eight players, including wider levels to support the boosted player count. There’s also The World of Light, a lengthy campaign where you move around several board game-like areas and, with the help of spirits you equip to boost your stats, fight augmented clones of fighters created by a reality-ending cosmic deity to unlock the path ahead.\n\nOn Switch 2, the load times are lightning fast, giving you quicker win screens and making modes like Squad Strike instantly load in new characters instead of stuttering for a short time. It’s very minor and likely due to the hardware rather than a specific Switch 2 update, but it’s welcome nonetheless. You’ll likely already have Super Smash Bros Ultimate, as it’s essential for anyone who has or had the Nintendo Switch. If you don’t, though, it’s probably the most feature-rich fighting game on the platform and well worth picking up.\n\nThe only Nintendo console Street Fighter 6 is playable on is the Switch 2, but it’s a fantastic return to form for Capcom’s premier fighting game. Its roster is the best in the series so far, ranging from the classic World Warriors from Street Fighter 2 to newcomers with a variety of different fighting styles. It’s also got the most diverse base mechanics in a Street Fighter game to date, adding a Drive gauge that enables you to parry, counter, and dash with a few different button combinations, letting you press the advantage or weather a particularly destructive combo.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is split into three different rooms. Arcade, Training, and local Versus modes are all part of the offline branch, while World Tour has you create a custom character’s appearance, fighting against the world’s best fighters to gain stats and learn new moves via the main cast who act as mentors. You also have online lobbies, which allow players to match up against each other with conventional characters, as well as use their World Tour fighter in special battles, and even play a rotating selection of classic Capcom Arcade games.\n\nSwitch 2 owners also get the first couple of seasons of DLC characters at no extra cost, featuring eight bonus fighters to play as in the various arcade and versus modes, as well as become your mentor in World Tour. Online also feels really good, featuring rollback netcode and crossplay with the other versions. In comparison to the PC or other console versions, Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2 doesn’t have quite as detailed visuals. However, it has decent performance, as long as you set the console to 120Hz, which gives you tighter button inputs for snappier reaction times. Even though the exclusive gyro modes are gimmicky at best, you’re not getting a significantly nerfed version if you can only get the Switch 2 version.\n\nDragon Ball FighterZ is the best anime fighter available, and also one of the best team fighters. With a roster that includes favorites from the mainline Dragon Ball Z and Super shows, as well as DLC that adds Dragon Ball GT and the DBZ movie villains, it’s clear that Arc System Works loves the late Akira Toriyama’s most famous work. The moves for each feel like a natural fit, with supers capable of an explosive Destructive Finish if you hit an opponent with low health, while show-referencing Dramatic Finishes require specific stages and a button or special move. Thanks to Arc System Works’ stunning cell-shading techniques, FighterZ also closely resembles the look of the anime itself, occasionally surpassing it when reenacting key moments from the show, such as the end of Goku vs Frieza on Namek or Teen Gohan vs. Perfect Cell.\n\nCompared to other 3v3 fighters, there are several mechanics to learn. Auto-combos allow new players to hit their opponent with entire strings, ending in a devastating super move. This makes it accessible to just about anyone, but Dragon Ball FighterZ also rewards timing with its other mechanics. Deflection of basic projectiles is possible with a button press, and the Dragon Rush closes the gap between you in an instant, catching your rival off guard. There’s also a story mode featuring three distinct arcs and a brand new fighter, Android 21, whose design was approved by Toriyama.\n\nWhile there’s no specific Switch 2 upgrade, Dragon Ball FighterZ did get a significant balance patch in October 2025 that introduces a brand new Z-Reflect mechanic. We also got confirmation that SSJ4 Goku (Daima) will be a new character added to the roster in 2026. Unfortunately, there’s still no word on whether we’ll ever see crossplay support in the future. However, since Arc System Works is still actively updating it outside of minor balance patches, there’s a slim chance.\n\nArc System Works also has its own fighting game series on the Switch family of consoles, and it’s also the most accessible one in the series. Guilty Gear Strive is a reboot of sorts, slimming down the mechanics of this anime fighter to make it more forgiving for newcomers while also keeping just enough depth for veterans. Key mechanics include ways to defend yourself from oncoming attacks, such as Faultless Defense, which is handy for negating and pushing away an attacker. That said, it also features four different types of Roman Cancel, a universal technique that lets players cancel moves to extend combos at the cost of some of the Tension gauge (this game’s version of a super meter).\n\nIn addition to the many arcade, training, and online modes, all of which run buttery smooth on the Switch, there are also two full-length story modes. Despite being non-playable in-engine Original Video Animations (OVAs), similar to those released directly to home video in the 1990s, they look stunning, do a decent job of expanding the universe, and give vital context to character rivalries and motivations. The soundtrack also stands out as each song has lyrics that are meaningful to the characters it’s associated with.\n\nThis recommendation does come with a caveat. While it was a little behind the other versions for a good few months, Guilty Gear Strive on the Switch now has ranked matches and all of the Season 4 characters, which include, among others, Kushinada from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Unfortunately, the sole sticking point is that the Switch version cannot link to Xbox, PlayStation, or PC fighters, severely limiting the online fighting pool. Hopefully, this is next on the list of changes, but until then, Strive is perfectly playable and handles very well on the Nintendo console.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a big departure from NetherRealm Studios’ long-running fighting series, in that you now fight with a partner by your side. In many ways, it takes inspiration from Capcom’s original Marvel vs. Capcom. By summoning what MK1 calls a Kameo character, you can extend your combos with one of three different moves. This adds to the core mechanics that remain unchanged from Mortal Kombat 9, which give you powered-up special moves, combo breakers, and powerful X-Ray attacks. Of course, there are also a huge number of gory fatalities, including ones performed by Kameo characters and even the long-awaited return of Animalities, where your character turns into a giant animal to kill your opponent’s dazed fighter.\n\nWhere NetherRealm’s games are great to play with friends or online, and generally Mortal Kombat 1 is great at this too, the single-player offerings are substantial enough to recommend them even if you don’t care about multiplayer. The campaign is a reboot of sorts to the established Mortal Kombat canon, redefining relationships between its cast, along with big twists that make it a thoroughly enjoyable romp and unlock a playable fighter for finishing it. There are also seasonal Krypt modes, giving players unlockable goodies as a reward for overcoming fights with conditions that are more often than not stacked against you, as well as Tower modes for a more arcade-like experience.\n\nWith all of this said, we only recommend Mortal Kombat 1 if you own a Switch 2. While it has seen many patches since the day one launch, even now on the base Switch, it looks as if someone’s smeared vaseline all over your screen. Its frequent frame rate stuttering, particularly when calling in Kameo characters, means you’ll drop combos and experience a lack of responsiveness throughout. The Switch 2 stabilizes the frame rate to a constant 60fps, and while it still doesn’t hit the visual highs of the PC version, it is now of decent enough quality that we can recommend it.\n\nIf you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, Soulcalibur 2 is one of the backwards-compatible GameCube games on offer at launch, and it’s the best version. It’s not just because it features Link from The Legend of Zelda as a guest character; the performance is a little tighter compared to the PS2 version, which was subject to frame hitching. While the Xbox did have 720p visuals, it lacked widescreen support. With modern upscaling options available via the Switch 2’s GameCube emulation, the improved resolution means significantly less these days.\n\nSo aside from Link and the fairly sizable roster, what makes Soulcalibur 2 so special? Much like the Dreamcast port of the previous game, which was actually better in every way compared to the arcade version, with some excellent mechanics that became series staples, such as revisions to the Guard Impact system to simplify what’s effective against each type of attack. Other defensive options include the Guard Break, which counters attacks and leaves the opponent open to blows of your own. It also feels faster than previous games in the series, and thanks to the improvements in GameCube emulation over the years, this version feels as good, if not better, than the original did.\n\nSoulcalibur 2 includes multiple game modes that were popular at the time, such as robust training, a survival gauntlet, and even some that are unlockable via the exclusive Weapon Master campaign. This single-player mode has players travel the world in search of challenges, such as fighting while a gale blows you towards the edge of the arena, or entire dungeons filled with enemies and traps. It’s how you unlock all the bonus characters and just about everything else that Soulcalibur 2 has to offer. While a bit primitive compared to Mortal Kombat 1’s Krypt, it’s still a fantastic addition.\n\nWhile Tekken hasn’t graced the Switch family of consoles as of yet, the closest you’ll get for now is Pokkén Tournament DX. This upgraded port of the Wii U spinoff includes 21 Pokémon to choose from in battle, with two more added as DLC. Each one has two different movesets; the Field Phase uses projectiles, and the Duel Phase is more like a conventional Tekken game. Landing a certain number of blows will shift the phases, keeping both players on their toes and opening up new strategies. Players can also use Support Pokémon to aid them with one-time effects, while the Burst Mode allows for temporary buffs and Mega Evolution.\n\nModes include the Ferrum League, where you compete in battles to increase your rankings in the various Leagues, as well as single and local battles against a friend for shorter bouts that you can customize the rules to add special items or even fight in teams of three. You can also take part in daily challenges that give you skill points for completing each objective. Skill points earned this way increase that Pokémon’s stats, while Poké Gold earned can be used to alter your avatar’s appearance.\n\nIt runs well on the original Switch, and while there are no noticeable performance upgrades on the Switch 2, outside of faster loading times, it’s perfectly playable on the system. It’s worth noting that some Pokémon in the roster received new Mega Evolutions in Pokémon Legends ZA, so it’s unlikely that Mega Chandelure and any new forms from the Mega Dimension DLC will appear in the future.\n\nNot many of SNK’s fighting games are available on the Switch family of consoles just yet, but we’d imagine that more will be coming now that the Switch 2 is more widely available. However, the Switch did at least get Samurai Shodown, the revival of SNK’s historical weapon-based four-button fighter, which is less focused on combos and more on spacing (or footsies, as the fighting game community commonly defines it). Counters are especially painful, especially if you manage to land a heavy attack. Your opponent will certainly feel it as a chunk of their health bar suddenly disappears.\n\nSamurai Shodown’s simple controls make it more accessible by default, and by emphasizing deliberate strikes over combos, you have less complexity overall. But it’s still a game that punishes carelessness, as disarming an opponent is possible and can be devastating. Meanwhile, the Rage Gauge allows you to perform one-time super moves that will almost certainly end the round. Blood splatters and violence aside, Samurai Shodown’s visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, with its striking character designs and gorgeous, scenic stage designs.\n\nOf all the games on this list, Samurai Shodown feels the most barren. Its lack of game modes means that you’re getting a more arcade-like experience. However, this streamlined approach does make it more affordable than a bigger-budget title. Though there are no upgrades with the Switch 2, the base game did get several DLC characters, including Baiken from the Guilty Gear series as the first-ever crossover character.\n\nArms is unique compared to the rest of the fighting games on this list. Its motion-based controls and modular hand combinations give its roster of pugilists a tad more flexibility. While all the moves are technically shared across every character, meaning you don’t need to memorize all sorts of different combinations, how each brawler or even each hand choice executes a move gives the game much-needed complexity. Fighters begin with access to just three hand types. However, you can unlock more via the Arms Getter mode, where you spend coins to participate in a minigame for a chance to win new hand types for that character.\n\nGetting coins means conquering the arcade-like Grand Prix, as well as playing some of the more unusual sports-like modes like V-Ball or Hoops, or challenging a gauntlet of 100 enemies. You can also play online in ranked matches, experience the chaotic party mode that bundles up to 20 players in one lobby, or connect Switch systems wirelessly for a party-style match for up to eight devices at once.\n\nArms is another one of those fighting games that’s improved significantly when played on the Switch 2, boasting faster loading times, improved image quality, and a boost to the frame rate. It also features HDR support, taking full advantage of the Switch 2’s LCD screen, which is capable of displaying those vibrant colors. Taking full advantage of all the game’s multiplayer modes years after launch might be a hard sell, especially the local wireless mode, but with the new upgrades to the base game, it may still be worth a look for a fun game night.\n\nFor years, there was no way to play the games in this collection without resorting to emulation, but Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection brings the entire classic arcade series in one bundle. These are perfect ports of all 7 Capcom-developed Marvel games, from X-Men: Children of the Atom to Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and even The Punisher as a bonus beat-em-up option. Some of the included games have features that you can toggle between to add secret fighters, tinker with the light intensity so it’s not as disruptive, and even reactivate a glitch that was patched out of one game in the collection.\n\nEach one of the emulated fighting games has its merit. You can see how the series evolved from a rather basic fighter in X-Men: Children of the Atom, how the divisive Infinity Stones affect Marvel Super Heroes gameplay, when the series began to focus on multi-fighter teams with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, the assists that appear in Marvel vs. Capcom, and finally, the 3v3 fights that define Marvel vs. Capcom 2. These games inspired the development of the more modern games on this list, such as Dragon Ball FighterZ and Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nIncluded in the collection is a Museum where you can see the key art, pamphlets, and instruction cards for every game. You also get to view scans of the character design drawings and stage concepts, preserving a little bit of history in a convenient place, and listen to both the original soundtracks (we still have Marvel vs Capcom 2’s music on loop), and remixes especially created for the collection. While there are a handful of Capcom arcade compilations available for the Switch, this is the only one that feels somewhat essential to own, just in case it disappears once more.\n\nWhile we’re still waiting for the sequel to grace the Switch 2, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, Rivals of Aether is the best platform fighter not officially made by Nintendo. Created as a spiritual sequel to a fan-made demake of the original Super Smash Bros running on the Game Boy, this 2D fighter takes lots of inspiration from the team’s previous project. Your chosen champion conjures the elements to knock the competition off the stage, while also affecting the stage in some way.\n\nCharacters are mostly original animal-based designs that represent one of the four elements. Bugs that throw massive rocks, fire-breathing lions, and even an orca-bear hybrid that throws puddles to teleport out of are just some of the weird and wonderful designs available. Rivals of Aether also features a few guest characters from well-known indie games, namely Ori and Shovel Knight, who fit in surprisingly well with the rest of the cast.\n\nCompared to the latest Super Smash Bros, Rivals of Aether doesn’t quite have the staying power due to a lack of modes. However, the available ones are well worth playing, such as the single-player Story mode that has you hop around each of the citadels for the base roster, where you must battle set characters to progress. You can also opt to fight in the co-op wave-based Abyss Endless mode, or challenge each of your buddies to a round of tetherball where you hit a ball tied to a string from your side to wrap it around a column to win points. Rivals of Aether may not be the most original game mechanically, but that doesn’t stop it from being a fun platform fighter alternative.\n\nIn SpiderHeck, you play as arachnids with laser swords and blasters. You and your opponents will hop around one of the many maps on offer in a first-to-eight-wins contest, where one false move could spell certain doom. Striking a rival’s weapon will make you bounce a fair distance, and each one has a limited number of uses, meaning you’ll frequently be scrambling for a new one.\n\nIt’s not just your rivals that you need to worry about, as spring pads will propel you and ordinance, such as bombs and rockets, in the direction they’re facing. There’s also the lava surrounding the battlefield that will fry you. While relatively simple to control as far as platform fighters are concerned, it’s tough to master the controls, particularly if you’re not used to similar rope-swinging mechanics such as any of the Worms games.\n\nNeverjam has, since launch, added more maps to scuttle your way across, as well as parkour challenges that become fiendishly difficult as you swing around using your webs. There are also tons of cool hats you can unlock to make your slick spider stand out from the crowd. There’s also the Tower of Heck, a cooperative mode that limits the weapon types on offer and can be played single-player. This chaotic creepy-crawly combat simulator is best played with three other players around a sofa, Joy-Cons in hand, with no prior experience and a bunch of drinks and snacks to whittle away an evening.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is demanding that OpenAI and Microsoft pay him between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages over his claims that he was defrauded.\n\nDetails of the claim were revealed by Musk's lawyer on Friday in a court filing ahead of a high-stakes jury trial set for April in Oakland, California.\n\nThe calculation of damages was laid out by the expert witness C. Paul Wazzan, named in the filing as \"a financial economist with decades of professional and academic experience.\"\n\nThe document alleges Musk was defrauded of the $38 million in seed money he donated to OpenAI when he helped found it in 2015, and states he is now entitled to a percentage of OpenAI's current $500 billion valuation.\n\nMusk said on his social media platform, X, on Friday: \"Can't wait to start the trial. The discovery and testimony will blow your mind.\"\n\nMusk is suing OpenAI's key leaders, including the CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, over allegations that the AI company misled him by shifting away from its core mission to remain a nonprofit.\n\nWazzan calculated that Musk should receive $65.50 billion to $109.43 billion in \"wrongful gains\" from OpenAI. He made a similar calculation for Microsoft's \"wrongful gains,\" which equated to between $13.30 billion and $25.06 billion.\n\nMusk has been using recently unsealed court documents to attack his rival in posts on X. On Friday, OpenAI published a blog titled \"The truth Elon left out.\"\n\nThe blog, which provided commentary alongside excerpts from several court documents, said that Musk wanted \"full control\" of OpenAI, \"since he'd been burned by not having it in the past.\" It added that OpenAI's leadership was surprised when Musk suggested having his kids control AGI, or artificial general intelligence, during conversations about succession planning.\n\nThe statements address the heart of Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\n\"Mr. Musk's lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Business Insider. \"This latest unserious demand is aimed solely at furthering this harassment campaign. We remain focused on empowering the OpenAI Foundation, which is already one of the best-resourced nonprofits ever.\"\n\nMusk and Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Jan 17 (Reuters) - Elon Musk is seeking up to $134 billion from OpenAI and Microsoft, saying he deserves the \"wrongful gains\" that they received from his early support, according to a court filing ​on Friday.\n\nOpenAI gained between $65.5 billion and $109.4 billion from the billionaire entrepreneur's contributions when he was co-founding what ‌was then a startup from 2015, while Microsoft gained between $13.3 billion and $25.1 billion, Musk said in the federal court filing ahead of his trial ‌against the two companies.\n\n\"Without Elon Musk, there'd be no OpenAI. He provided the bulk of the seed funding, lent his reputation, and taught them all he knows about scaling a business. A pre-eminent expert quantified the value of that,\" Musk's lead trial lawyer Steven Molo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment outside ⁠business hours on the amount of compensation ‌Musk is seeking.\n\nMICROSOFT AND OPENAI ALSO FILE SUITS\n\nDuring the week, OpenAI called the lawsuit \"baseless\" and part of a \"harassment\" campaign by Musk. A Microsoft lawyer has said there is no evidence ‍that the company \"aided and abetted\" OpenAI.\n\nThe two companies challenged Musk's damages claims in a separate filing on Friday.\n\nMusk, who left OpenAI in 2018 and runs xAI with its competitor chatbot Grok, alleges that ChatGPT operator OpenAI violated its founding mission in a high-profile ​restructuring to a for-profit entity.\n\nA judge in Oakland, California, ruled this month that a jury will hear the ‌trial, expected to start in April.\n\nMusk's filing says he contributed about $38 million, 60% of OpenAI's early seed funding, helped recruit staff, connect the founders with contacts and lend credibility to the project when it was created.\n\n\"Just as an early investor in a startup company may realize gains many orders of magnitude greater than the investor's initial investment, the wrongful gains that OpenAI and Microsoft have earned - and which Mr. Musk is now entitled to disgorge – are much ⁠larger than Mr. Musk's initial contributions,\" Musk argues.\n\nThe filing says Musk's ​contributions to OpenAI and Microsoft were calculated by his expert witness, ​financial economist C. Paul Wazzan.\n\nMusk may seek punitive damages and other penalties, including a possible injunction, if the jury finds either company liable, the filing says, without specifying what form any ‍injunction might take.\n\nIn their own ⁠filing, OpenAI and Microsoft asked the judge to limit what Musk's expert may present to jurors, arguing his analysis should be excluded as \"made up,\" \"unverifiable\" and \"unprecedented\" and as seeking an \"implausible\" transfer of billions from a nonprofit ⁠to a former donor-turned-competitor.",

    "description": "A millennial says quitting her Microsoft job to raise  her child was crucial for their development. She's now weighing a return to work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kruthika Jayatheertha, a millennial based in Bangalore, India. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn October 2024, my husband and I welcomed our first child into the world. I took a six-month maternity leave, which was provided through my senior user experience researcher job at Microsoft. During that time, I decided to turn it into a more extended career break. I resigned from my position, and my employment formally ended a few months later.\n\nI've long known that whenever I had a child, I'd want to take this kind of break — a decision shaped by my studies of psychology, a field in which I earned a Ph.D. I believe the first three years of a child's life are crucial for their development — and that having a present mother with a strong emotional connection can significantly shape a child's mental health for life.\n\nTaking a career break is a deeply personal decision, but it was clear to me that stepping away from work was the right choice.\n\nI know that taking a career break isn't for everyone, and I recognize it's a privilege to have been able to make this choice.\n\nBased on our savings and my husband's continued income from his consulting job, we felt comfortable with me taking a step back. We currently have a full-time nanny to help with childcare, and my parents also visit often to support us.\n\nWhile we remain financially comfortable, my husband and I have chosen to scale back a bit on travel — at times opting for domestic trips instead of international ones to help manage costs.\n\nBeing around my daughter full-time has allowed me to witness many of her \"firsts\" — crawling, standing, wobbly walks — without hearing about them secondhand. I've enjoyed the unhurried routines of feeding, bathtime, bedtime, and playtime that don't have to be squeezed in between meetings.\n\nMy plan is to take an 18-month career break and return to work when my daughter turns one and a half in April. When that time comes, I plan to explore part-time or freelance opportunities — with the potential for the right full-time role. This would give me the flexibility to balance my professional commitments and time with my daughter.\n\nGiven that I'd be returning to work during the crucial first three years of my daughter's life, I'd want a role that allowed me to maintain her morning and evening routines as consistently as possible. Even short bursts of undivided attention can go a long way in preserving our emotional connection.\n\nI'll likely target roles similar to the user experience researcher position I held at Microsoft. I'd also be open to returning to Microsoft — especially if a part-time opportunity were available.\n\nIf not for maternity leave and my desire to prioritize my baby, there's a good chance I'd still be working at Microsoft. I liked the company, enjoyed my time, and felt the culture was a good fit.\n\nI know it can sometimes be challenging to find work after taking a career break, but I feel a certain level of comfort because of the diverse set of skills and experiences I've built. My skills range from working as an assistant professor to consulting at a Big Four firm to my role at Microsoft.\n\nIn today's volatile job market, I believe that skill diversification is the new form of job security. I also believe my network will be valuable as I look to make a return to work. One of my college professors once said, \"If you are not networking, you are not working,\" and that wisdom has stayed with me. Even during my break, I've continued to network with industry peers and recruiters.\n\nOnce I begin my job search, I'll try to ensure I'm among the first 50 applicants for any role I apply to, to increase my chances. I'll also set notifications for job postings of interest and explore how AI tools can assist me throughout the process.\n\nOverall, I believe everything is \"figureoutable,\" and that one way or another, I will find a way to get a job.\n\nWhile a career break isn't the right choice for everyone, what matters most is that mothers are happy and fulfilled — because babies need happy, present moms, whether that comes from a job, a career break, or a mix of part-time work and parenting.\n\nI wish policymakers across the globe made it easier for at least one parent to step away from work during those critical early years of a child's life. As a society, I believe we need to prioritize children during this crucial stage of development — and some countries have taken meaningful steps in that direction.\n\nMy legacy shouldn't be defined solely by my career or professional accomplishments — it's also about contributing to the next generation: emotionally resilient, mentally healthy, empowered children.",

    "description": "Officials ultimately banned fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending a November match, a decision that has sparked immense criticism.",
    "fullText": "An apparent error by Microsoft's Copilot is roiling a UK police scandal.\n\nOn Monday, West Midlands Police chief constable Craig Guildford wrote to a Parliamentary committee that his officers did not catch a hallucination by Microsoft's AI tool when they were preparing their security recommendations for a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Aston Villa on November 6.\n\nUltimately, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv were barred from attending the UEFA Europa League fixture, a decision that sparked a torrent of criticism reaching as high as Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nThe episode highlights the importance of all workers verifying AI output as the technology's adoption expands. A spokesperson for Microsoft said it could not replicate the results Guildford said the department received.\n\n\"Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations. It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nGuildford said that Microsoft Copilot provided false information about a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham United, a different Premier League squad. That game never happened, but the details were used to inform a decision that led to the police force's decision to deny Maccabi Tel Aviv fans entry to the game against Aston Villa.\n\nOn Wednesday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told Parliament that she had lost confidence in Guildford.\n\nIn the letter, Guildford apologized to the parliamentary committee investigating the matter because he had testified that AI was not used by the force in preparing their recommendations. He had previously said a Google search provided the inaccurate information.\n\n\"I had understood and been advised that the match had been identified by way of a Google search in preparation for attending HAC. My belief that this was the case was honestly held, and there was no intention to mislead the Committee,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to the BBC, more than 700 police officers were deployed ahead of the game. Multiple protests occurred outside the stadium. In November, West Midlands Police said they had classified the match as \"high risk.\"\n\nIn an October statement, the police force had said its decision was based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences\" that occurred during a separate game involving Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam the previous year.\n\nAs Israel's oldest soccer team, Maccabi Tel Aviv has spent decades trying to break through at the top levels of European soccer. The Europa League is UEFA's second-highest level of competition for continental teams, behind the Champions League.",

    "description": "Business Insider found where 44 of Microsoft's data centers are located as of 2024. It promised this week consumers won't be on the hook for them.",
    "fullText": "As backlash intensifies against data centers nationwide, Microsoft says it has a plan.\n\n\"We'll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don't increase your electricity prices,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote in a blog post one day after President Trump said in a Truth Social post that he does not want Americans to \"pick up the tab\" for data center electricity costs. Microsoft, he said, was \"first up.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid an unprecedented data center construction boom across the US. Developers filed permits for 1,240 data centers in the US as of 2024 — roughly quadruple the level in 2010, according to a 2025 Business Insider investigation.\n\nWith it has come concerns over rising consumer electricity costs and grassroots opposition to construction buildouts.\n\nMicrosoft filed permits for 44 data centers as of the end of 2024, Business Insider found, the fifth highest count in our analysis. Half of Microsoft's permitted facilities are among the very largest in the analysis — the 322 massive data centers that we estimated consume 40 megawatts of electricity or more each.\n\nTake a look at where Microsoft's data centers are found:\n\nTwenty-four of Microsoft's data centers are located in Virginia as of 2024, followed by Texas with eight, and Illinois and Iowa each with four, according to Business Insider's count.\n\nMicrosoft's data centers are extremely electricity-intensive, Business Insider's analysis suggests. Its most power-intensive facility as of 2024 is in Maricopa County, Arizona, according to the analysis.\n\nAmazon's 177 data centers are on pace to command the highest electricity demand in Business Insider's analysis at between 30 and 48 terawatt-hours a year. Microsoft — with only around a quarter of Amazon's facilities — claims the next-highest spot.\n\nWhen reached in 2025, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged that its data centers \"do not always run at 100% of their installed capacity.\" Amazon disputed Business Insider's methodology, and QTS declined to comment. Google and Meta did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nIf all of Microsoft's 44 permitted facilities come online, their electricity demand could reach between 16 and 25 terawatt-hours a year, according to Business Insider's estimate. The midpoint of that range is about as much electricity as 1.8 million US homes based on average annual use.\n\nIf every permitted facility in Business Insider's dataset comes online, their electricity demand could reach between 149.6 terawatt-hours and 239.3 terawatt-hours annually, Business Insider's investigation found.\n\nThe low end of Business Insider's estimate is roughly equivalent to the state of Ohio's electricity needs in 2023, and on the high end, is nearly as much power as the entire state of Florida used that same year. A 2024 federal report projects demand could reach levels at the higher end of Business Insider's estimates by 2026.\n\nThe location of data centers has sparked a surge in community outcry, with neighboring residents concerned about their impact on rising electricity prices. Data centers' extreme electricity demand frequently requires utilities to build out new grid infrastructure. Utilities often socialize the investment costs, shifting billions of dollars of costs to all ratepayers, including residential customers, a Business Insider investigation found.\n\n\"Utilities can fund discounts to Big Tech by socializing their costs through electricity prices charged to the public,\" a 2025 Harvard Law study of regulatory proceedings about utility rates for data centers found.\n\nTo ensure Microsoft's data centers do not increase residential electricity bills, Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote that the tech giant plans to ask utilities and regulators to set the company's rates high enough to cover its data centers' electricity costs.\n\nSmith pointed to Microsoft's recent support of new electricity rates that charge \"very large customers,\" such as data centers, for the costs incurred to provide them with electricity. Smith also said that when grid infrastructure improvements were necessary to serve its data centers, the company would pay for those improvements.\n\n\"We believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create,\" Smith wrote.\n\nThe promise comes amid a broader affordability push from President Trump, including plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest rates.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft has released its \"Patch Tuesday\" update for January, and you should ensure your computer receives these security fixes as soon as possible. This update addresses 114 vulnerabilities in total, including three zero-days (bugs that have been actively exploited or publicly disclosed before an official fix is available from the developer).\n\nAs reported by BleepingComputer, security flaws were found across the following categories: 57 elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities, three security feature bypass vulnerabilities, 22 remote code-execution vulnerabilities, 22 information disclosure vulnerabilities, two denial of service vulnerabilities, and five spoofing vulnerabilities. Six of the remote code execution vulnerabilities and two of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities are considered \"critical.\"\n\nYour machine should receive security updates automatically when Patch Tuesday drops, which is around 10 am PT on the second Tuesday of the month. You can check to confirm by going to Start > Settings > Windows Update and selecting Check for Windows updates\n\nOne of the three zero-days fixed this month has been actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, labeled CVE-2026-20805, is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Desktop Windows Manager that allows attackers access to memory addresses from a remote ALPC port. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) & Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have been credited with identifying this bug.\n\nThe other two zero-days have been publicly disclosed. CVE-2026-21265 is a security bypass feature vulnerability that allows threat actors to bypass Secure Boot on systems that have not updated certificates issued in 2011 and nearing expiration. CVE-2023-31096 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in third-party Agere Soft Modem drivers that ship with supported Windows operating systems installed. Microsoft has removed these drivers from Windows.\n\nMicrosoft released other non-security updates today, as well as additional patches for Microsoft Edge and Mariner vulnerabilities earlier this month.",

The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.",

    "title": "Microsoft Is Finally Working on a Worthy Answer to Apple's 'Handoff' Feature",
    "description": "Start using an app on your Android, then continue where you left off on your PC.",
    "fullText": "Love it or hate it, the Apple ecosystem really does have its perks. Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great.\n\nMicrosoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps.\n\nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board.\n\nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible.\n\nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.\n\nIt's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability.\n\nThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.",

    "description": "Microsoft is officially retiring Microsoft Lens, unless it decides to delay again.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever. Devices lose support, standards are replaced, and software becomes obsolete. So it is with Microsoft Lens, whose days are numbered. Keen observers have known about this since August, when Microsoft first announced that Lens would be retired in September and removed from app stores in November. That obviously didn't happen, as the company adjusted the deadline to Dec. 15, which also came and went. Microsoft kicked the retirement can down the road—that is, until now.\n\nMicrosoft Lens was Microsoft's solution for anyone in the mid-2010s who didn't own a scanner. Rather than buy an expensive piece of hardware to digitize documents, Lens allowed people to use their smartphone camera to turn those hard copies into digital files. It was hardly the only document scanner available on app stores (Apple's Notes app has had the function built in since iOS 11), but because it was made by Microsoft, it was a good solution for getting files into Microsoft apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. It's also free and compatible with both Android and iOS, making the app universally accessible. We even listed it first in our roundup of the best document scanner apps from 2021.\n\nAccording to the app's support document, Microsoft Lens officially began retirement proceedings on Jan. 9. That doesn't mean the app is dead, though: Microsoft will still support it until Feb. 9. After that, the app will receive no updates, and Microsoft will remove it from app stores. (If you're passionate or curious about Microsoft Lens, make sure to install it before then.) No matter what, however, you'll only have another month to use it. As of March 9, you will no longer be able to create new scans in Lens, but you'll still be able to view your previous scans as long as the app remains on your device.\n\nOnce we settle into mid-March, Microsoft Lens users will need to choose an alternative scanning app. Fortunately, there are plenty of options on app stores to choose from. In fact, you might not need to download anything new at all: As mentioned above, iPhone users can tap into the Notes app's built-in scanner, while Google Drive users can do the same.\n\nMicrosoft, of course, wants you to stay within the ecosystem, so they'd prefer you use OneDrive's built-in scanner. If you already have that app on your phone, it might be as good an option as any. However, there are popular, dedicated apps, like Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, and Photomyne, that offer additional features not available in built-in scanners.",

    "fullText": "Yet another data center will soon emerge near the Far Westside of San Antonio, according to a recent Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) filing. It's set to further the Lone Star State's reputation as a tech cluster.\n\nThe quaint town of Castroville, with a population of just over 3,000, will soon house a $400 million development owned by Microsoft. Online records show that the project, named SAT 82, will take up roughly 195,000 square feet in Medina County.\n\nAlthough it's only a one-story building, it will take nearly two years to build, according to the TDLR. Construction at the spot, 3580 FM 471 North, will begin on Thursday, August 13, 2026. A visit to the property revealed that equipment and a welcome poster were already on site. An open field, a two-lane road, and residential properties sit nearby.\n\nIn time, the structure will likely take on the look of a windowless warehouse. It may be hard for residents to get a clear glimpse of the center, as each contains extensive fencing around its perimeters for safety and security purposes, Microsoft's website states.\n\nSAT 82 joins six others in Medina County, according to the TDLR: SAT 80, SAT 81, SAT 89/90, SAT 93, SAT 94, and another with the title SAT 82, but with a different address.\n\nThe centers provide the infrastructure needed to open a phone application, join a virtual Zoom meeting, play an online game, and more. According to the company's website, they also allow the company's Azure cloud platform, AI, and collaboration tools to continue operating as normal.\n\nEarlier this fall, community members in a private Redbird Ranch neighborhood Facebook group voiced concerns over Microsoft's presence in the area. A few users worried the company's projects would worsen traffic. Others highlighted the massive amount of water that data centers use.\n\nIn a 2024 sustainability report, Microsoft said that its water consumption in 2023 - which includes but is not limited to data centers - increased by 1.7 billion gallons from the previous year, coming in at 2.1 billion gallons. The company attributed the increase to its business growth.\n\n\"Improvements as part of our Redmond campus modernization project are estimated to yield over 50% reduction in water use for new facilities,\" it continued in the report.\n\nConstruction on the property is expected to wrap up by 2028, according to the TDLR.\n\nThis article originally published at Microsoft bets $400M on tiny Texas town with new massive data center.",

    "description": ": No naming that tune and no album covers",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is celebrating the resurgence of interest in physical media in the only way it knows how… by halting the Windows Media Player metadata service.\n\nReaders of a certain vintage will remember inserting a CD into their PC and watching Windows Media Player populate with track listings and album artwork. No more. Sometime before Christmas, the metadata servers stopped working and on Windows 10 or 11, the result is the same: album not found.\n\nWe tried this out at Vulture Central on some sacrificial Windows devices that had media drives and can confirm that a variety of compact discs were met with stony indifference. Some 90s cheese that was successfully ripped (for personal use, of course) decades ago? No longer recognized. A reissue of something achingly hip? Also not recognized.\n\nWindows Media Player - guess the album - Click to enlarge\n\nWe asked Microsoft if the service had indeed been retired or if there might be a reprieve or workaround, but we were met with equal indifference from the tech giant's PR organ.\n\nA message on a Reddit forum purporting to be a chat with a Microsoft support representative suggested that the servers have indeed been shut down, and that a third-party alternative should be sourced.\n\nAlternatively, customers can manually enter the information, like it's the 1990s all over again.\n\nThe timing is unfortunate. Tired of content vanishing from streaming services or disappearing into algorithmic feeds, consumers are returning to physical media like CDs.\n\nPhysical media drives have yet to completely disappear from Windows devices, but the default service used by Windows Media Player for album information, musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com, does not appear to serve up any metadata.\n\nWindows Media Player has a long history with Windows. First released as part of the Multimedia Extensions for Windows 3.0, it evolved over the years, gaining support for streaming, ripping, and burning CDs. It survived Microsoft's Zune experiment and remains in Windows 11 - though now branded \"Legacy\" as Microsoft pushes users toward its modern Media Player app.\n\nMicrosoft does not share its device telemetry, but it clearly concluded too few users still play CDs to justify maintaining the metadata services.\n\nApple's iTunes, on the other hand, recognized every CD we threw at it. ®",

    "description": "What if a group chat of fellow laid-off Microsoft workers helped you find your next job? Job seekers are finding solidarity — and new gigs.",
    "fullText": "After being laid off from his AI product manager role last September, one of Aman Goyal's first moves in a tough job market was to buy a book.\n\nWith the 26-year-old's purchase of \"Decode and Conquer,\" author Lewis Lin provided Goyal with access to a private Slack community with more than 20,000 professionals and job seekers.\n\nOver the next six weeks, Goyal conducted about 40 mock interviews through the community with fellow job seekers, some of them current product managers from major tech firms like Microsoft and Amazon. Goyal said the practice helped him prepare for interviews at T-Mobile, where he accepted an offer in November.\n\n\"I think it's a good community for you to practice and also find some good network connections,\" said Goyal, who lives in Seattle. \"The mock interviews helped with my confidence and just building that muscle of answering those questions spontaneously.\"\n\nOver the past year, I've spoken with more than a dozen people who have found ways to turn job searching into a group project. While networking is a time-tested job search strategy, these job seekers have taken it a step further: forming layoff support groups, joining exclusive networking circles, or turning to social media for feedback and encouragement.\n\nThey hoped the added support would help them break through in a market that has grown more challenging in recent years, with employers now hiring at one of the slowest rates since 2013.\n\nWhen Sreeja Apparaju began looking for a job in the fall of 2022, she turned to her most trusted network — a close circle of four friends.\n\nAfter the University of California, Berkeley students realized they were applying to many of the same software engineering roles, they decided to join forces: trading job leads and recruiter contacts, swapping interview tips, and offering each other moral support along the way.\n\nApparaju said the collaboration helped her land two interviews — and ultimately, a job offer. In one case, a friend told her about a role at Palantir they'd interviewed for and shared the recruiter's email. Within a week of reaching out, Apparaju received an online assessment that led to an interview with the company. In another instance, a friend's cousin provided a referral for a software engineering role at Snap — the company behind Snapchat — where Apparaju later received and accepted an offer.\n\nHer friends also found success, with one landing a role at Amazon and another joining Salesforce.\n\n\"There can be a culture of keeping to yourself because you want to be ahead of people,\" said the 24-year-old, who lives in New York. \"But in my experience, just sharing what you know and helping each other out was a lot easier and faster for all five of us.\"\n\nLooking for work alongside your closest friends is an experience that's arguably unique to a college senior. But outside that bubble, some job seekers are finding new ways to make their searches more collaborative.\n\nAfter 14 years at Microsoft, Deborah Henderson was laid off from her user researcher role last May. After learning the news, she messaged colleagues to see who else had been affected and added them to a group chat. Over the following weeks, more than a dozen people shared job leads, helped one another prepare for interviews, vented frustrations, and celebrated successes.\n\n\"The fact that we could immediately build community was just incredibly helpful,\" she said. In August, Henderson accepted an offer for a user experience role at Meta — a position she learned about through her network and was referred for.\n\nIn the absence of formal support networks, some job seekers have turned to social platforms for help. That includes career-focused sites like LinkedIn, where many have publicly announced layoffs or added \"open to work\" badges — as well as broader platforms like TikTok.\n\nLast May, Andrew Z. Chen was just weeks away from earning his computer science degree from the University of California, San Diego — and still didn't have a job lined up. So when Amazon invited him to interview for a software engineering role, he didn't want to waste the opportunity. His plan: hole up in his room to study — and document the process on TikTok to hold himself accountable.\n\nChen said the videos — which racked up as many as 2.6 million views — drew a wide range of reactions. Some viewers were skeptical he could land the role given his limited prep time. But others, including people who'd interviewed at Amazon, offered encouragement and shared advice on the types of technical questions to expect.\n\n\"The videos brought a lot of doubt from viewers, but thankfully also a lot of advice and encouragement,\" said Chen, who's in his 20s and lives in New York.\n\nWeeks later, he accepted the role at Amazon.\n\nSupport from others navigating the job market has helped some job seekers stay motivated; however, many are still struggling to secure job offers.\n\nLast July, Sriram Ramkrishna was laid off from his developer relations role at Intel. He's struggled to find work, but said he's leaned on the support of former Intel colleagues who were laid off around the same time — and has helped some of them land interviews.\n\n\"Many of us have been helping each other with our job searches — sharing opportunities and offering support,\" said Ramkrishna, who is in his 50s and lives in Portland, Oregon. \"It feels like we're all looking out for each other.\"\n\nBeyond those connections, Ramkrishna said he's also leaned on private developer relations Slack channels and Discord servers he was invited to through conferences and past professional relationships. Some include job-specific channels where hiring managers post openings directly, he said.\n\nApparaju said that while securing her role ultimately came down to how she performed in the interviews, the support of her friends helped her stay focused and confident throughout the process.\n\n\"Having people who were cheering for you and also working hard with you was honestly so motivating,\" she said. \"Every win for my friends felt like a personal win, and it was an inspiration to keep pushing to crack that one job offer.\"\n\nApparaju knows she'll never be able to replicate her college experience of job hunting alongside close friends, but she believes her network can still be valuable. She recently mentioned some potential openings at her company to a friend — one example, she said, of how she can keep that spirit of support alive.\n\n\"Given how tough this job market is, everybody and anybody is super happy to help,\" she said.",

    "title": "The Secret Microsoft App That Improves How I Use Windows",
    "description": "PowerToys really should come pre-installed for every Windows 11 user.",
    "fullText": "I'm someone who routinely switches between Mac and Windows. It's a hazard of being a tech writer. But the thing is, I'm so used to the user friendliness in macOS that whenever I shift to Windows mode, there are some hiccups. Windows tends to throw up walls where there really shouldn't be any. I used to just white-knuckle through it, but that was before I fully embraced PowerToys.\n\nPowerToys is a collection of utilities made by Microsoft itself. It's free to download on GitHub, or a myriad of other places, and unlike with Windows 11, Microsoft actually adds useful and interesting features to it every couple of weeks. You can download and install PowerToys from the GitHub page, the Microsoft Store, or using Windows Package Manager.\n\nHere are a few of PowerToys utilities that have become a must for me (after installing the app, you really should browse all that it offers to see what strikes your fancy). If you took them away, I wouldn't be sure how to use my Windows PC anymore—this thing should really come pre-installed.\n\nThese days, Windows Search can come across a little heavy and bloated, just like the Start menu. While it’s fine for opening apps once in a while, I can’t really use it for anything more than that. Plus, I’m a macOS user, so I’m used to Spotlight Search’s lightning-fast keyboard launcher. While you can use third-party keyboard launchers on Windows now (Raycast being the latest addition), my favorite option is actually Microsoft’s own keyboard launcher, the Command Palette that’s included in PowerToys.\n\nLike Spotlight Search, it’s light and fast, and you can assign any shortcut to it. I use it to quickly launch apps, search for files, and even search for open windows. Command Palette even has a really helpful Bookmarks feature that I use a lot. I’ve created bookmarks for quickly opening frequently used folders like Downloads and Screenshots, and even websites. A Bookmark can be triggered by searching for a keyword, or through its own dedicated keyboard shortcut (I’ve set one up for my Downloads folder, which is really handy). For more, I’ve got a detailed guide on setting up Command Palette that you should check out.\n\nIt's mind-boggling that Windows 11 still does not have an automatic dark mode. Over the years, Windows 11's dark theme has slowly expanded to cover all the apps you care about. But there's no easy way to toggle it on, and there's no way to automatically turn it on in evening, or on a schedule.\n\nSo, of course, there's a PowerToys utility for that. The recently added Light Switch utility lets you create a global custom keyboard shortcut for turning on the dark theme. For the Schedule section in the Light Switch utility, you can set up an automated schedule based on fixed hours, or using the local sunset time, which is how I use it.\n\nI shuffle between macOS and Windows 11 all the time, and there are some creature comforts in macOS that I now have a hard time living without. One of them is the ability to quickly preview any file in Finder by pressing the Space button. There is no such option in Windows, and until now, you needed a third-party app to enable it, which wasn't always reliable. Now, Microsoft has included a similar feature in PowerToys' Peek utility. Once enabled, you can press the Space bar after selecting any file to preview it. You can then use the arrow keys to navigate to other files in the folder as well. Press Enter to open the file in the default app.\n\nWindows has a built-in OCR (or text extractor) feature for images that can be accessed via the Snipping Tool. But it's really slow. When I'm in a pinch and I need to copy text from an image, I prefer to use the Text Extractor utility in PowerToys instead. It's much faster. Use the dedicated shortcut Windows + Shift + T to see an overlay on the screen. Use the mouse to highlight the area that you want to transcribe. Once you let go of the cursor, the text will be saved to your clipboard automatically.\n\nThis is one of those PowerToys utilities that really should be a default Windows 11 feature by now. Resizing an image, or a batch of them, is something that I need to do often, as someone who writes online for a living. But you might need it too, from time to time, to compress or resize images for an online upload, or a presentation. Instead of opening a heavy image editing program and manually resizing images one by one, use this plugin instead.\n\nOnce enabled, it will show up in the right-click menu in File Explorer. Select one or multiple images, click Resize with Image Resizer, choose one of the size presets (you can add more presets from the PowerToys app) or create a custom resolution, click the Resize button, and that's it.\n\nI can't imagine using Windows without PowerToys' Awake utility. It adds a handy little tray icon that I can click to keep my PC awake longer than the default sleep settings would allow for. I have a custom-built PC with a big honking power supply, so I take my auto-sleep settings quite seriously. But there are times when I'm downloading a large file in the background, or I have a long AI task running, when I want the PC to stay on. That's where the Awake utility really helps. You can choose to keep your PC awake indefinitely, or for 30 minutes, 1 hour, or any custom duration.\n\nThe built-in window management in Windows is quite impressive in its own right, but it falls short for my workflow. I usually like working with my text editor, a browser, and Slack open at all times. Because I have a large monitor, I have my writing app and Slack on one side and a browser on another. But it can take me a while to get everything set up. This is where FancyZones really helps. I can create custom zones for each app I use that helps me puts them where I want them, and resizes them, too.\n\nTo set this up for yourself, first go to the FancyZones section in PowerToys utilities. Here, open the Zones Editor and create a new custom layout. You can now use the mouse to move the zones around and to add a new zone. Once a layout is enabled, all you have to do is move a window around and hold down the Shift key. Dropping the window in any designated zone to instantly resize it.",

    "description": "GitHub, the dominant software development platforms, is responding to the rise of AI coding services and AI agents",
    "fullText": "Microsoft wants to overhaul GitHub to compete with AI coding rivals and embrace AI agents, and the company has started reshuffling teams to make that happen, according to people familiar with the changes.\n\nGitHub is a leading software development platform that Microsoft acquired in 2018. GitHub had an early lead because of its popularity as a place to store code. Lately, though, GitHub has faced more competition from AI tools such as Cursor and Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nMicrosoft in January 2025 formed a new group focused on building AI tools under ex-Facebook engineering boss Jay Parikh. The group, called CoreAI Platform and Tools, combined Microsoft's developer division, AI platform team, and GitHub.\n\nStill, Microsoft and GitHub have remained somewhat separate, and the company has been moving people and resources around over the past few months to better coordinate efforts such as sales, one of the people said. The latest change, happening this week, is moving a small group of Microsoft engineers over to GitHub.\n\nThe goal, the people said, is to better compete with AI coding tools that rival GitHub Copilot, while getting in the race to build AI agents and fulfill Parikh's vision to build an \"agent factory.\"\n\nIn an internal meeting late last year, Parikh spoke about needing to overhaul GitHub to compete with Cursor and Claude Code, according to audio reviewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"GitHub is just not the place anymore where developers are storing code,\" Parikh said at the time. \"We want it to be the center of gravity for all of AI-powered software development.\"\n\nMicrosoft wants GitHub's AI tools to be available wherever developers work, not just inside one app, to wants to make GitHub a kind of dashboard for managing multiple AI agents.\n\nThe latest changes are also part of what Parikh said would be new investment in improving the basic parts of GitHub. In the meeting, Parikh said those include making improvements to its GitHub Actions tool that automates building, testing, and deploying code, analytics and insights tools so teams can see how their code is performing, security for keeping the code safe, and making sure the company can meet local data storage rules to offer GitHub in new countries.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Nandita Giri is a senior software engineer with experience at Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. She recommends job seekers spend an hour a day learning AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nandita Giri, a 32-year-old software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy journey began with problem-solving and math long before I knew I'd end up in Big Tech.\n\nI studied at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra, in India. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google often scout talent from this school.\n\nAmazon hired me straight out of college, and I moved to Seattle in 2018. To get the job, there was a logical analysis test, and only a handful of us passed. Then came multiple interviews based on problem-solving. That's how my journey in tech began.\n\nI'm now a senior software engineer at Microsoft, and my AI skills are in high demand.\n\nWhen applying for roles at Amazon, it's not about solving problems as quickly as possible, but solving them optimally. You must carefully consider the issue so that the solution can scale and be easily maintained. Amazon has a set of leadership principles that play a key role in hiring decisions, and understanding these principles is just as important as your coding skills.\n\nOn my own time, I practiced on LeetCode, a platform for coding challenges, because I liked it, not because I was preparing for interviews. Over time, I developed a strong interest in AI.\n\nOnce I arrived at Amazon, I identified tasks and patterns that could be automated and suggested AI-based solutions to management, primarily focusing on internal workflow automation and data-driven decision support systems. That experience shaped my interest in building intelligent tools for enterprise use. Leadership gave me the green light to implement them, and I successfully integrated AI into our team's workflow.\n\nAfter working at Amazon for about four years, a recruiter from Meta contacted me on LinkedIn. I never aimed to work at Meta, but my skills opened up new opportunities. I wanted to work more deeply in applied AI, and Meta offered an opportunity to focus on building intelligent systems with large-scale data and infrastructure. It was a natural next step to grow in the AI space.\n\nI went through the interview process, secured the job, and began working at Meta in 2022.\n\nI was referred internally to Microsoft based on my work at Meta. I decided to move because I wanted to work on enterprise-focused AI products, such as Copilot, which aligns more closely with my long-term interests in building impactful tools for productivity and business transformation. I've been at Microsoft since 2023.\n\nThroughout my career, I've had multiple competitive opportunities. With each role change, my scope of responsibility, impact, and overall compensation increased.\n\nMost of what I know about AI, I taught myself. I spent hours outside work watching YouTube tutorials, reading blogs, and practicing. I started small, creating AI agents for personal tasks, like sending outreach emails. Tasks that used to take me a day or two can now be completed in under an hour.\n\nSeeing those results motivated me to keep learning. What started as a personal side project has now become a central part of my career.\n\nAmazon and Meta both incorporate fast-paced learning, but Meta's codebase is more straightforward. Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are all built from a single repository, allowing you to understand the system more quickly.\n\nAmazon's codebase is huge, which makes the first year challenging, but the learning curve is worth it. Microsoft feels different altogether. It's more enterprise-focused, operating at a massive scale.\n\nAI excels at repetitive or static tasks, and our job is to monitor and guide it. Managing AI, I believe, is the future of software engineering.\n\nDemand for AI roles is skyrocketing, while traditional software engineering roles have shrunk over the last five years. Many of my friends who don't work in AI have struggled to land new offers.\n\nI recommend dedicating just one hour a day to learning AI. Within six months, you'll see real progress, and these skills will be critical for the next decade. For beginners, I recommend the following:\n\nIf I were to advise my younger self, I would tell her to focus less on perfection and more on making an impact, to take ownership early, speak up with confidence, and prioritize learning and growth over titles.\n\nLong-term growth comes from solving meaningful problems and maintaining resilience.",

    "description": "Tired of all the Microsoft AI slop? You can remove it entirely.",
    "fullText": "Some people love AI. If you're not one of them (or if you have a favorite AI tool that isn't baked into it), using Windows 11 can feel increasingly hostile. It seems like every part of it now exists to push you into using Copilot—even notepad.exe has a prominent AI button in the user interface at this point.\n\nIf you'd like your operating system to go back to being an operating system, check out \nRemoveWindowsAI. This free script changes various registry keys to disable AI features including Copilot, Recall, and the Copilot integrations in applications including Edge, Paint, and Notepad. Using various workarounds , it then configures Windows Update to not install those updates again (the documentation breaks the process down, if you're interested).\n\nTo get started you need to open Microsoft PowerShell on your computer. Make sure you're using Windows PowerShell 5.1, and not the updated PowerShell 7 (this only really applies if you've intentionally installed PowerShell 7, so don't worry about this step if you didn't actively do that).\n\nTo start the script you will need to copy a command from the Github page for RemoveWindowsAI and paste it into your PowerShell window (I'm not including the command directly here in case it changes in the future). Once you do, the user interface will show up, allowing you to choose which AI features you want to disable. Make your choices and watch the changes take place in the PowerShell window.\n\nI tried this out, removing everything. I then opened Notepad—no Copilot icon in sight. The Copilot application was also gone, along with all reference to AI in the Settings application. It would be nice if Microsoft offered a way to do this without resorting to this sort of unofficial workaround, but that isn't the world we live in.",

Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.\nA report on the site TipRanks said that Microsoft is \"considering massive layoffs\" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on Bluesky and X for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden purported that the news was \"false\" on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X.",

    "description": "Some collectors will stop at nothing to complete their collections, even if that means decades have to pass before ever finishing. One such collector was on such a journey, finding and acquiring every Xbox 360 game released, and at the start of this year, that collector has finally finished this now vintage library that totals around $20,000--with the last game being a gift from their son.\nRedditor uncleseeth shared their massive library in a post on the r/gaming subreddit on January 2. Starting the collection after receiving their Xbox 360 and Neversoft's Western shooter Gun on Christmas Day in 2005, uncleseeth then went on a mad hunt for every single game ever released on Microsoft's seventh-generation console. From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a \"complete set,\" which doesn't include the variants of various games.",

A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own Elite Series 2 and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Scuf Valor Pro, and GameSir G7 Pro.",

    "description": "Diarmuid Early won first place in the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. He has some pointers for using Excel at work.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Diarmuid Early, the 40-year-old winner of the 2025 Microsoft Excel World Championship. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been in the Excel business for about 20 years.\n\nI played around with it a little bit in college and started using it professionally at Boston Consulting Group. Then I spent 10 years at Deutsche Bank as a business manager. It was lots of data analysis and reporting on financials.\n\nI've been doing my own thing for about six years now, so I've pretty much used Excel my entire career.\n\nWinning the Excel World Championship felt great. I've been a long-term underperformer in the postseason. I've been first or second seed going into the knockouts every year. I've made it to the final stage in Las Vegas the last couple of years, but I think fifth was my best finish before.\n\nMy number one tip for office workers is to believe that there is a better way.\n\nWhenever you find, 'Oh god, I've been copying and pasting this for the last 10 minutes, and I still have 15 minutes to go,' whenever you find yourself doing something that is manual and repetitive, it is very likely that Excel has a better way to do it.\n\nIt is very likely that, if you ask Google or ChatGPT a brief description of what you need, 1,000 or more other people have wanted to do the same thing over the years.\n\nIn my experience, 80% of the things I've ever struggled with in Excel, if I Google it with a reasonably crisp description, there's a post out there somewhere saying how to do it.\n\nLearning to use the SUMIFS function is probably going to take you longer the first time than just doing it yourself. But it's going to be a little bit faster the second time, a lot faster the third time, and one bajillion times faster over the thousand times you have to do it over your career.\n\nIt's also much less likely to be wrong or have unexplainable errors that you will get if you're doing it manually.\n\nIt'll take you a little longer the first time, but if you're the most junior, new employee at a company, they kind of expect you to be stupid and take ages to do things. If you are stupid and take ages the first time, and the second time you do it 10 times faster, the payoff over six months, not to mention your career, is pretty huge.\n\nAs you start to learn more of those things and start to stitch them together to do more complex things, the payoff is exponential.\n\nIt's great to be able to very, very quickly zoom through and say, \"The answer is seven.\" If you get to that quickly, you get more time to say: \"Does it make any sense that the answer is seven?\"\n\nIt's the thing that the junior bankers, the junior consultants, are least likely to do. They see it as their job to turn the crank on the model, hand over the answer, and the next person above them on the chain says: What does this mean? What's the insight? Does it make sense?\n\nTaking the time to do that yourself and then communicating that gets you a lot more credibility. It also makes you a lot more likely to spot your own stupid mistakes until someone spots them for you.\n\nThe thing that I find most horrifying is when I see a formula that is 50 different numbers together in the form: A1 + B3 + C5 + D10. Someone has obviously hand-typed them all or, plus click plus click plus click.\n\nThe amount of time that takes, and the chances that you will misclick one time and have something wrong you'll never be able to find, is really high.\n\nThat's one of the more entry-level ways to go down a dark path. There's basically, at every level of Excel skill, there's the thing you're doing wrong that you don't realize you're doing wrong until you get to the next level. There are problems all the way up.\n\nWhen it gets there, I think AI will be very helpful in taking people from bad to not bad, or maybe even bad to good. It's probably not going to be much help to people like me who are already quite experienced.\n\nIf it gets to a level where it can teach me new things in Excel, then there's not much room left for human Excel users.\n\nI've got 50,000 hacks. I used to do a lot of Excel training in my BCG days. Every now and again you would teach someone something, and you'd see this look of combined joy and horror on their face. You subsequently find out: \"This is the thing that, if I knew this last night, I would not have had to work until 2 a.m..\"\n\nThat is the person who will never forget what you just taught them.",

    "title": "How CEOs are using AI in their daily lives",
    "description": "CEOs are obsessed with AI. Microsoft's Satya Nadella uses it for podcast-listening, and Booking's Glenn Fogel uses it for public speaking.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, including introducing its Copilot assistant in 2023, inking a $13 billion partnership with OpenAI in 2024, and creating teams dedicated to developing the tech.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella, who took charge of the company in 2014, previously discussed how recent developments in AI will change workflows and humans' cognitive labor. For Nadella, AI has become a necessary part of his life, both in and out of the office, according to Bloomberg.\n\nDuring an interview published in May, Nadella said he enjoys podcasts but doesn't listen to them. Instead, he uploads the transcripts of podcasts to the Copilot app on his phone so he can discuss the content with a voice assistant during his commute.\n\nWhen he reaches Microsoft's headquarters in Washington State, Nadella uses Copilot to summarize his Outlook and Teams messages. He utilizes at least 10 custom agents from Copilot Studio to help with meeting prep and research.\n\n\"I'm an email typist,\" Nadella told the outlet.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has become one of Silicon Valley's most prominent tech giants thanks to OpenAI's premier product, ChatGPT.\n\nThe company launched a chatbot demo in 2022, and it quickly went viral on social media as people inquired about everything from diets to recipes. Over the last three years, OpenAI has shared more advanced GPT programs with users and is working to expand its global reach despite competition from Chinese tech companies like DeepSeek.\n\nThis January, President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion private-sector investment in AI infrastructure called Stargate. OpenAI was among the companies asked to help with that project.\n\nSo, it's unsurprising that Altman uses AI to streamline tasks his his personal life. Altman appeared on Adam Grant's \"ReThinking\" podcast this January, saying, \"Honestly, I use it in the boring ways.\"\n\nAltman said the AI bots help him process emails or summarize documents. The tech has also helped him with fatherhood.\n\nDuring an OpenAI podcast interview published in June, Altman said he used AI \"constantly\" after welcoming his first child in February.\n\n\"Clearly, people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time,\" Altman said. \"I don't know how I would have done that.\"\n\nNow, Altman said he mostly uses ChatGPT to research developmental stages.\n\nAnother major player on the global tech scene is Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO. The California-based company is one of the most valuable in the world, with a market value of over $3 trillion, according to Google Finance. The company is focused on designing and manufacturing hardware, including chips and graphical processing units to assist AI.\n\nDuring the 28th annual Milken Institute Global Conference in May, Huang told the audience he uses AI programs to learn new concepts.\n\n\"I use it as a tutor every day,\" Huang said. \"In areas that are fairly new to me, I might say, 'Start by explaining it to me like I'm a 12-year-old,' and then work your way up into a doctorate-level over time.\"\n\nAI's ability to rapidly collect, analyze, and communicate information could close the tech gap, according to Huang.\n\n\"In this room, it's very unlikely that more than a handful of people know how to program with C++,\" Huang said. \"Yet 100% of you know how to program an AI, and the reason for that is because the AI will speak whatever language you wanted to speak.\"\n\nIn a 2024 interview with Wired, Huang said he uses Perplexity and ChatGPT \"almost every day\" for research.\n\n\"For example, computer-aided drug discovery. Maybe you would like to know about the recent advancements in computer-aided drug discovery,\" Huanng said. \"And so you want to frame the overall topic so that you could have a framework, and from that framework, you could ask more and more specific questions. I really love that about these large language models.\"\n\nApple is navigating the global AI market under CEO Tim Cook, who announced Apple Intelligence — a generative AI system — at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2024. He also unveiled a slew of other AI-based features at the time, including the Image Playground and the ability to remove unwanted background details from photos.\n\nCook, who became CEO in 2011, publicly spoke about how he uses AI day-to-day in a 2024 interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said Apple Intelligence helps him summarize long emails.\n\n\"If I can save time here and there, it adds up to something significant across a day, a week, a month,\" Cook told the outlet. \"It's changed my life,\" he says. \"It really has.\"\n\nOne year earlier, Cook appeared on \"Good Morning America\" and said he was \"excited\" about developments in AI.\n\n\"I think there's some unique applications for it and you can bet that it's something that we're looking at closely,\" Cook said.\n\nReal estate tech companies like Zillow are also leaning into AI. The company announced in 2023 that it implemented an \"AI-powered natural-language search\" to help users navigate the website.\n\nCEO Jeremy Wacksman, like the other executives, has begun using AI to be more efficient.\n\n\"I spend a lot of time either catching up on meetings I've missed or on asynchronous documentation,\" Wacksman told The New York Times Dealbook. \"You can tell ChatGPT, 'Treat me like my role. Here's all this data — summarize it for me the way I would need to know going forward,' and you can get a personalized summary. That's just — that's far more valuable to me than to try to read a transcript at one-and-a-half speed or watch a video at one-and-a-half speed.\"\n\nWacksman added that he wants Zillow staffers to experiment with the technology.\n\n\"We've had what we call 'AI days,' where we showcase work and celebrate examples,\" Wacksman said. \"We've also started weaving it into our bigger meetings, like product reviews: When a product manager-design-engineering team is prototyping, oftentimes, they're now using an AI tool called Replit. They're prototyping really quickly to get something in front of a user.\"\n\nLike many other companies, Coinbase has recently sought to expand its operations using AI. The cryptocurrency exchange acquired Agara, an AI support platform, in 2021 to expand its customer experience tools. Nearly three years later, CEO Brian Armstrong said in an X post that his development team witnessed their first \"AI to AI crypto transaction.\"\n\n\"What did one AI buy from another? Tokens! Not crypto tokens, but AI tokens (words basically from one LLM to another). They used tokens to buy tokens,\" Armstrong said.\n\nCoinbase partnered with Perplexity AI to give traders access to real-time crypto data, CEO Brian Armstrong said in an X post this July.\n\n\"Perplexity is now ingesting our market data, including COIN50, and using it to power market analysis,\" Armstrong said.\n\nArmstrong, who cofounded Coinbase in 2012, said he was enthusiastic about the tech during a \"Cheeky Pint\" podcast episode published in August 2025.\n\n\"Even as CEO, by the way, I use it a lot,\" Armstrong said, adding that he and the Coinbase team are testing the limits of decision-making in AI.\n\n\"We use a decision-making process called RAPIDS, and everyone writes their input,\" Armstrong said. \"We have a row now for AI that writes its input in as one of the people that help make decisions. We're testing the limits of it. Like, when can it actually start to be the decision-maker on some things and do better than humans?\"\n\nDuring the same interview, Armstrong said he fired Coinbase employees who hadn't adopted AI into their workflow before a given deadline.\n\n\"Some of them had a good reason because they were just getting back from a trip or something,\" Armstrong said. \"Some of them didn't, and they got fired.\"\n\nLinkedIn has followed in the footsteps of its parent company, Microsoft, by integrating AI into its platform, including an AI-powered coaching tool that provides professionals with tips and resources. In November 2025, the company announced that premium subscribers gained access to an AI-powered people search.\n\nDuring a fireside chat at the company's San Francisco office in October 2025, CEO Ryan Roslanksy said using AI to complete tasks is like \"having a second brain.\" One way he uses AI in his daily life is drafting \"high-stakes emails\" to executives, including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\"A lot of the time when I'm sending a super high-stakes email to Satya Nadella or other CEOs or world leaders or etcetera, you've got to make sure you sound super smart when you do that. I would say that without a doubt, almost every email that I send these days is being sent with the help of Copilot,\" Rolansky, referring to Microsoft's AI assistant, said.\n\nHowever, Rolansky said AI doesn't write the entirety of emails. Instead, the tech guides him through a step-by-step process to determine the end result.\n\n\"Historically, there'd be a button that said, 'Draft the reply for me.' And it would just try to draft the reply,\" Rolansky said. \"The problem is that you're actually asking AI to make tons of decisions for you when you ask it to blindly reply to an email.\"\n\nEli Lilly, a pharmaceutical company, is one of many in healthcare learning how to use AI.\n\nIn September 2025, the company announced it's creating an AI-powered platform designed to give five biotech companies access to drug discovery models. Eli Lilly, in October 2025, said the supercomputer it is building with Nvidia could take AI to the next level.\n\n\"Our supercomputer will be the most powerful in the pharmaceutical industry and enable AI-based research at a scale previously thought impossible,\" a press release said. \"It has the potential to expand our ability to discover, develop and distribute new medicines faster.\"\n\nDuring an episode of the \"Cheeky Pint\" podcast published in November 2025, CEO David Ricks said he finds the technology quite helpful for meetings.\n\n\"I read a lot of medical journals. I go to conferences where data is presented,\" Ricks said. \"I spend time with our scientists to stay curious. Yeah, now I have at least one or two AIs running every minute of every meeting I'm in, and I just am asking science questions.\"\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Ricks said he prefers to use Anthropic's Claude or xAI's Grok rather than OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nBooking Holdings is adding AI to features for consumers across its brands, which include Booking.com and Priceline. In 2025, for example, the company announced a new generative AI tool that allows users to search for properties \"in their own words.\"\n\nCEO Glenn Fogel told Business Insider that he uses the technology to improve his public speaking. Fogel uploads videos of his keynote speeches into chatbots, then asks for feedback.\n\n\"I put it through an LLM to say, 'could you please come back to me, tell me, what do you think I could have improved upon?'\" he told Business Insider.\n\nFogel told Business Insider that AI has given him suggestions, including flagging a hand movement that could distract his audience.",

    "description": "Two DeepMind cofounders are now on the opposite sides of an intensifying AI talent war, as Microsoft lures away Google employees in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Google was not spared by this year's AI talent wars.\n\nThe Gemini creator lost employees from its AI and cloud business, even though the company also made significant hires from other Big Tech companies.\n\nUnlike Apple, which mostly lost AI talent to Meta, which splurged big on recruitment this year, most significant departures from Google ended up at Microsoft.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's rivalry with Microsoft's AI unit is one between two DeepMind cofounders who parted ways. Mustafa Suleyman, now steering Microsoft's consumer AI push, and Demis Hassabis, the current CEO of Google DeepMind, launched DeepMind alongside researcher Shane Legg in 2010. They built a research lab so influential that Google bought it for more than $500 million in 2014.\n\nBut a decade later, Suleyman departed Google and founded Inflection AI. He and most of his team were subsequently absorbed by Microsoft in a $650 million \"acqui-hire,\" which made him the AI lead of the company.\n\nThe competition for AI recruitment continues to intensify as hiring cools in the Big Tech job market. Here's a running list of the AI talent Google has lost this year and where they've ended up.\n\nIn July, Subramanya left his position as vice president of engineering at Google to join Microsoft as its corporate vice president of AI. He had been with Google for more than 15 years. In December, it was announced that he was joining Apple.\n\nSadovsky was a distinguished software engineer and senior director at Google for nearly 18 years before joining Microsoft as the corporate vice president of its AI division in June.\n\nGupta was a principal engineer at Google DeepMind before leaving for a position as technical staff on Microsoft's AI team. Prior to Google, Gupta also worked for Meta.\n\nThe former head of global customers engineering at Google left the company. Regini is now the senior vice president of the global solutions engineering unit at SentinelOne, which is a cybersecurity company that provides an AI-powered platform for enterprise security.\n\nRothfuss was a research scientist at Google DeepMind before leaving in May to join Microsoft as a member of technical staff on the company's AI team.\n\nLee was the senior director of corporate development for Google Cloud and DeepMind. He is widely credited for assisting with Google's high-profile acquisitions, including the $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz in March. In December, Lee left for OpenAI as its new vice president of corporate development.\n\nFrank was a senior director of product management at Google, who was responsible for advertiser and customer engagement platforms. He joined Microsoft as the corporate vice president of AI monetization.\n\nPotti was the general manager of Google Cloud's security business for more than five years.

    "description": "Business Insider reached out to more than 75 major employers, including Walmart and Google, about their efforts to support aging workers.",
    "fullText": "Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.\n\nWalmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls \"wraparound care\" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.\n\nFifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "description": "Microsoft is leading Wedbush's AI stock list as its favorite large-cap tech company to own in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street's loudest tech bull has given his five top AI stock picks for next year, and Nvidia isn't one of them.\n\nThat's a bit of a surprise for Dan Ives, the Wedbush Securities analyst known for his vocal cheerleading for the stock as it climbed to records throughout the year.\n\nHe's instead focused on a handful of other mega-cap names heading into 2026, and sees AI approaching an \"inflection point\" next year, he write in a new note to clients.\n\n\"While Nvidia remains in our top tech names into 2026, there are 5 AI-focused names that we believe will be front and center heading into 2026,\" Ives said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $625 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wall Street looks like it's underestimating the growth Microsoft could see with Azure. The company also looks poised to make an \"AI driven shift\" next year, Wedbush said, adding that Microsoft was its favorite large-cap tech stock to own in 2026.\n\n\"While AI use cases built markedly in FY25, its clear FY26 for Microsoft remains the true inflection year of AI growth as CIO lines build for deployments.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $350 (+28% upside)\n\nRationale: Wedbush said it believed Apple would begin monetizing its AI products over the next few years. That could add $75 to $100 of value per share of company stock, Ives estimated.\n\n\"The elephant in the room remains the invisible AI strategy, with the biggest consumer installed base in the world of 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, the time is now for Apple to accelerate its AI efforts,\" he wrote.\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+32% upside)\n\nRationale: 2026 could be a \"monster year\" for Tesla as the EV company makes more ground on its AI and robotics initiatives, Ives suggested. He pointed to the company's ongoing development of its full self-driving technology and its Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in April next year.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year and in a bull case scenario $3 trillion by the end of 2026,\" Wedbush said.\n\nWedbush's price target: $230 (+27% upside)\n\nRationale: Demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform remains \"unprecedented,\" Ives said.\n\n\"With the company making strategic moves to remain at the forefront of AI, we believe that PLTR has a golden path to become a trillion-dollar market cap company and will grow into its valuation as Karp and Co. remain one of the largest players in the AI Revolution.\"\n\nWedbush's price target: $600 (+26% upside)\n\nRationale: CrowdStrike is gaining momentum in its AI deals. It also appears to be gaining market share as it expands its product suite.\n\n\"CrowdStrike remains one of our favorite tech names,\" Ives said. \"We believe the Street is underestimating the growth potential for CrowdStrike with cybersecurity remaining a second/third derivative beneficiary of the AI Revolution which speaks to our bullishness.\"",

    "fullText": "Our reporting revealed a symbiotic relationship between the IDF and Silicon Valley – with implications for the future of warfare\n\nIn January this year, Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham first reported that Microsoft had deepened its ties to Israel alongside other major tech firms. Since then, the Guardian has published an award-winning series of investigations – in partnership with the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call – that has revealed a symbiotic relationship between Silicon Valley and the Israeli military.\n\nOne investigation exposed an Israeli mass surveillance program scooping up virtually all Palestinian phone calls and storing them on Microsoft’s cloud services – setting off an inquiry that ultimately prompted the company to cut off Israel’s access to some of its technology. Another story revealed that the Israeli military created a ChatGPT-like tool to analyze data collected through the surveillance of Palestinians. Yet another revealed that Google and Amazon had agreed to extraordinary terms to clinch a lucrative contract with Israel.\n\nI asked Davies and Abraham to discuss what they learned this year – about the role of these technologies in Israel’s assault on Gaza, whether these business ties are sustainable, and what the revelations tell us about how the wars of the future will be fought.\n\nHow did Israel’s relationships with these companies change after October 7?\n\nYuval Abraham: The Israeli military had been fetishizing artificial intelligence and big data for many years – a trend that is very much connected to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians, because the occupation generates a lot of data. What changed after October 7 was the scope. The military was looking to bomb hundreds of targets every day in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people were recruited into reserve duty. That meant a huge spike in usage of technological systems. That’s where the big tech companies stepped in.\n\nHarry Davies: There was a huge surge in demand – not just for the storage capacities of the tech companies, but also for the products that they offer to analyze the information used to prosecute a war. What’s valuable for the military is the way in which these services are able to provide what’s known as “blob storage”, which allows them to store and process infinite amounts of raw intelligence information.\n\nWhat has made Israel such an appealing market for these companies?\n\nYuval Abraham: As we reported, the Israeli army has been collecting Palestinian phone calls for a long time. But when you want to collect the phone calls of an entire population every day, and you want to retain those phone calls for long periods of time, you need a lot of storage room and processing power.\n\nIf you remember the [Edward] Snowden revelations, many of them had to do with metadata, which doesn’t weigh a lot. But the Israeli military also wanted to store mass audio files, images or videos – and for that it felt it needed the assistance of companies like Microsoft. In the West Bank, sources have told us this information has been used to find dirt on people to blackmail them. In the Gaza Strip, we know that this massive trove of intercepted phone calls was also used in airstrikes that killed civilians.\n\nSo data is power and data is control. And these American cloud providers allow the Israeli military to store a lot of data and to sift through it very effectively. That has direct consequences for people on the ground.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nTo send a message to Harry and Yuval please choose the ‘UK Investigations’ team.\n\nYou can message Harry using the Signal Messenger app. Use the ‘find by username’ option and type hfd.90\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email harry.davies@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nHarry Davies: Yossi Sariel, the former head of [Israel’s elite spy agency] Unit 8200, wrote a book under a pseudonym that we revealed to have been published by him. In that book, he articulated what at the time was a bold and radical vision – as Yuval described, this fetishization of Silicon Valley technology. He recognized the possibilities that the likes of Google, Amazon and Microsoft could afford the Israeli military. Two years before October 7, he said that militaries and governments needed to forge relationships with these companies that are similar to the relationships they have with companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. So he was already thinking about these companies as instrumental to war and surveillance in the way that a defense contractor provides components for fighter jets or manufactures bombs and missiles.\n\nSome of our reporting has looked at how elements of his vision have come true and have been put into effect, both before October 7 and afterwards, in both the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nWe know AI is central to Israel’s military operations – its army has developed its own AI capabilities, as you revealed, Yuval, and has also purchased AI tools for use from Microsoft. Why is AI so central to Israel’s broader war aims?\n\nYuval Abraham: What AI did was allow Israel to achieve the effective results of carpet bombing without losing the legitimacy of a data-driven assault with targets and objectives. In Gaza, one way in which the Israeli military used AI was to give a score to almost every person in Gaza who has a phone number, determining how likely it was that person was a member of Hamas or Islamic Jihad. This score was based on a machine-learning algorithm [developed by Israel] called Lavender. It was trained on a dataset of known Hamas members. AI allowed the Israeli military to generate and bomb tens of thousands of military targets, on a scale that without AI would not have been humanly possible. Many of the targets were not Hamas members, according to sources. And Israel for the most part bombed these people not while they were engaged in military activity, but when they stepped inside their families’ homes.\n\nThese AI systems had an error rate that the Israeli military knew about. But to me, the key thing about AI is not the mistakes that it makes. It’s the scale of destruction that it allows militaries to unleash, and it’s a discourse of legitimacy that it enables – a discourse of targets and collateral damage.\n\nAI also seems to me to incentivize mass surveillance, right? Because it allows for the analysis of ever-growing reams of information.\n\nHarry Davies: Signals intelligence agencies have long collected more information than they could humanly process. That served as a kind of restraint on their ability to conduct mass surveillance. I think we’re now seeing a shift where AI allows an intelligence agency like Unit 8200 to make sense of things that previously it struggled to make sense of.\n\nMicrosoft explicitly credited your reporting for changing its policies. Are you seeing any other signs of shifts within the tech industry?\n\nHarry Davies: I think we’re seeing a lot of discomfort and dissent within these companies at both a junior and to some extent senior level. Many employees have been disturbed to find what the products and services that they’re working around the clock to build and market are actually contributing to. There have been protest groups which have emerged from current and former employees within these companies. That’s true across Silicon Valley. I think that played some role in the decision that Microsoft made as a result of our reporting. They were facing a lot of pressure internally.\n\nYuval Abraham: And there’s also a legal question for these companies: if the ICJ [international court of justice] ends up ruling that Israel has committed a genocide, then a follow-up question will be: who contributed to that genocide? Which companies helped maintain it and sustain it? For some people in these companies who are thinking ahead, that could also be a cause for concern.\n\nIt sounds like you think shifts in public support for Israel could actually affect these business relationships.\n\nYuval Abraham: Israel has developed a reliance on these companies for its Nimbus project, which is a huge contract signed between Israel and Google and Amazon back in 2021. It is moving the data of many of its government ministries, along with troves of information from the Ministry of Defense, onto these companies’ cloud servers.\n\nThese are US companies. They’re taking a certain gamble here that the US will stay loyal to Israel and won’t block, limit or sanction them.\n\nMicrosoft only blocked access to technology that was specifically enabling the mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls – there are still many relationships between Microsoft and the Israeli military. But Microsoft’s action made many people in the Israeli system nervous. It was the first time we know of that a big tech company withdrew services from the Israeli military. It made some people ask whether Israel is making a mistake by giving these foreign companies so much leverage. That question is folded within a larger question of what the US will do, what will happen in 2028 if there’s a more progressive administration in the White House, at a time when so many Americans believe that Israel has committed a genocide in Gaza.\n\nWhat’s your focus going to be in 2026?\n\nYuval Abraham: I think we only uncovered the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHarry Davies: We’re both very conscious that, although we have spent a lot of time working on this, we still just have glimpses inside the system. We’re continuing to build a fuller picture of how this technology was and continues to be used in Gaza and in the West Bank as well.\n\nThere’s good reason to continue paying attention. Militaries pay attention to what other militaries are doing. There is great interest among other western militaries in how Israel prosecuted this war, in how it integrated these kind of technologies.\n\nAnd there are other militaries whose combat systems and processes are already deeply integrated with Silicon Valley tech. Take the American military, for example. Look at what’s happening right now in the Caribbean. Are those operations somehow free of the involvement or reliance on systems and services provided by these companies? I suspect not. We don’t know for sure, but the Pentagon and the US military have very big contracts with all of these companies to provide cloud services. Post-Gaza, we have to look at these relationships and ask: what is the involvement of these companies and their technology in military decisions, in military operations and in warfare more broadly?\n\nYuval Abraham: Much of our reporting is based on whistleblowers, on individuals who are in proximity to power or hold positions of power.\n\nHarry Davies: Our confidential sources have remained confidential and we are always interested in hearing from new people. Our door is always open.\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham using one of the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.
