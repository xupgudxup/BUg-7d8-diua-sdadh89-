    "description": "In its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Tesla said fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Everything is going great over at Tesla. Wait, sorry, no. Everything is going bad over at Tesla. The automaker held its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, announcing that fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025. Beyond posting its lowest profits in years, Tesla's revenue from car sales was down 11% year-over-year, and it was the second year in a row that sales declined.\n\nIt gets worse. As reported by TechCrunch, on the call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is killing off the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. This isn't exactly a surprise, as the two EVs are Tesla's oldest models, with the Model S launching in 2012 and the Model X following three years later. It's been years since either have been strong sellers; while Tesla no longer breaks out their sales, in 2025 it delivered 50,850 units of the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X combined (a 40.2% decrease compared to 2024), with the latter two likely making up 30,000 of those. Honestly, this should've happened a long time ago, ideally followed by next-generation versions of both, but that was never gonna happen. Instead, Tesla gave both models a couple of enshittifying facelifts over the past few years, the most recent of which came just a few months ago.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said on the call, \"so if you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\" The last units of both cars will be built at some point next quarter. Musk said their discontinuation \"is slightly sad.\" Boo hoo. He added that Tesla will support Model S and Model X owners \"for as long as people have the vehicles,\" whatever that means.\n\nTaking their place on the assembly lines of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory will allegedly be the Optimus robot. As The Verge reports, Musk said the \"mass production\" version of the Optimus will be shown later this quarter, and the first one will allegedly be built before the end of the year. We've heard how those promises usually turn out. Previously, Musk has said he aims for Tesla to build a million of them per year. Uh huh. He's also focused on getting the Tesla Cybercab out. We're not holding our breath for that one, either.\n\nPutting everything else Tesla and Elon-related aside, it is a shame to see the Model S get snuffed out like this. It did revolutionize the car industry, and while newer versions have been suckier, the early years of the Model S were truly great. Too bad their creator is focused on making the automotive world, and the world as a whole, a worse place.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy posted his \"notes from Claude Coding,\" describing a shift in engineering over the last two months.",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding.\" Now, he sees a \"phase shift\" in software engineering.\n\nAndrej Karpathy is one of AI's guiding figures. He was a founding member of OpenAI and later served as Tesla's director of AI. He also coined the term \"vibe coding,\" the AI-assisted coding movement that has taken software engineering by storm and was named Collins Dictionary's word of the year.\n\nIn his \"random notes from Claude Coding\" — which are over 1,000 words long — Karpathy wrote about the changes to his own coding style. Posted on X on Monday, the notes have already elicited reactions from engineers at Anthropic, xAI, and more.\n\nAI coding agents \"crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nA few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in…\n\nKarpathy name-dropped both Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex as having significant improvements. Claude Opus 4.5, the model that has garnered much love from engineers online, came out at the tail end of November.\n\nThe AI leader's workflow has changed as a result of the AI tools. From November to December, Karpathy's 80/20 ratio flipped. He once used 80% manual coding and 20% agents; now, it's 80% agents and 20% manual code editing.\n\n\"I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words,\" he wrote.\n\nThe change to AI-written code \"hurts the ego,\" but is too powerful to ignore, Karpathy wrote. He also devoted a whole section of his notes to the \"fun\" he has while coding with large language models.\n\nWhat of those traditional coding skills, the ones you learn in a computer science program or through endless digital courses? That's a whole other function, Karpathy wrote, and one that might decline.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" he wrote.\n\nIn Karpathy's comments, engineers from leading AI companies sounded off. Ethan He, an xAI engineer and Nvidia alum, wrote that a \"10x engineer can be a one-man army.\"\n\nCharles Weill, another xAI engineer, wrote that founders can now \"divide themselves\" with coding agents, like a VC divides their capital over a portfolio of companies.\n\nBoris Cherny, an Anthropic staffer and the creator of Claude Code, wrote that he read Karpathy's \"thoughtful\" post till its end.\n\nThe Claude Code team at Anthropic may offer a model of where the industry is moving, Cherny wrote. His team is \"mostly generalists\" and filled with 10x engineers.\n\n\"Pretty much 100% of our code is written by Claude Code,\" Cherny wrote. \"For me personally it has been 100% for two+ months now, I don't even make small edits by hand.\"\n\nThe Anthropic employee also acknowledged the \"quality\" problems with AI-written code. Agents can overcomplicate things and can leave around dead code, he wrote.\n\nHis solution: having AI review the AI-written code.",

    "title": "What the latest earnings from Tesla and Meta tell us about who's winning the AI race",
    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the company will be discontinuing the Model S and X in the next quarter, bringing an end to the EV maker's more premium SUV and sedan models.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" the CEO said during Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nMusk said Tesla is replacing the Model S and Model X production lines in its Fremont Factory in California with an Optimus factory, with the long-term goal being to produce one million robots a year.\n\nTesla will continue to support the Model S and Model X vehicles for as long as people have them, Musk said, adding that for people interested in owning one, \"now would be the time to order it.\"\n\nThe CEO said the shift was \"slightly sad\" but part of the company's \"overall shift to an autonomous future.\"\n\nTesla's stock was up on Wednesday after the company beat earnings expectations and announced it would invest $2 billion into xAI, Musk's AI company. Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version. The Model X was $99,990, or $114,990 for Plaid.",

    "description": "Waymo robotaxi is closing the gap on pricing and wait times next to Uber and Lyft — key metrics riders factor in when choosing a ride, a study found.",
    "fullText": "Waymo's robotaxis are getting more competitive with Uber and Lyft as the autonomous vehicle service closes the gap on pricing and wait times in San Francisco, while Tesla undercuts everyone on price, a first-ever study comparing all four platforms showed.\n\nObi, a ride-hailing price aggregator, on Tuesday published a study that provides a snapshot into the state of the ride-hailing competition in the San Francisco Bay Area, a major hub for autonomous vehicles and traditional ride-hailing services.\n\nWaymo's robotaxi service is not only closing the price gap with Uber and Lyft but also competing better on wait times; both factors — price and long ETAs — were among the highest-cited issues consumers had with ride-hailing companies in general, according to a survey Obi conducted as part of the study.\n\nObi's June 2025 study on Waymo found prices 30% to 40% higher than those of Uber and Lyft. This latest report, conducted between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, shows Waymo is now an \"average of 12.7% more expensive than an Uber and 27.3% more expensive than a Lyft.\"\n\nWaymo also appears to be competing better on wait times with the two ride-hailing giants, according to the study. Over a 24-hour period, Obi's data showed that Waymo's ETAs better matched Uber's and Lyft's, except at peak demand times around 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., when Waymo's wait times spiked.\n\nWaymo's average ETA was 5.74 minutes, whereas Lyft's was 5.14 minutes, and Uber's was 3.15 minutes.\n\n\"That's the biggest change to me,\" Ashwini Anburajan, CEO of Obi, told Business Insider. \"It's the convergence in price as well as the reduced wait times because now you can actually compare them. It's a more honest comparison between the three platforms.\"\n\nObi's report also looked at Tesla Robotaxi, the newest entrant in the Bay Area's ride-hailing market, and found that it had the longest wait times by far, with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. However, the study found that it beat every competitor on pricing.\n\n\"Obi's data shows that the price for a Tesla robotaxi ride in San Francisco rarely exceeds $10, averaging $8.17 vs. the next cheapest option, Lyft, which averages $15.47,\" the report said. \"That's a staggering $7.30 average price variance.\"\n\nAnburajan told Business Insider that Tesla's pricing is reminiscent of Uber and Lyft in the early days.\n\n\"They're using the playbook that Uber and Lyft used when they first came into the market — dramatically lower pricing, undercutting what's existing in the market, and really just driving adoption, driving downloads, driving people to use the app,\" Anburajan said. \"And we know that playbook works.\"\n\nFor the Obi CEO, Tesla's wait times are the difference between a nascent service and a serious ride-hailing competitor.\n\n\"I don't think people realize how critical wait times are in selecting a robotaxi or a regular rideshare,\" Anburajan said. \"They're a huge factor in how people decide.\"\n\nAn Uber spokesperson declined to comment. Spokespeople for Lyft, Waymo, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nObi's findings are a snapshot from a limited window, as prices and wait times can swing with seasonality. Still, the study captures how the Bay Area market is shifting: Tesla is buying demand with lower fares, while Waymo is increasingly looking less like a premium service and more like a viable substitute for Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe data on Waymo tracks with the company's recent expansion in November, when the company increased its robotaxi fleet from 800 cars to more than 1,000.\n\nObi's survey suggests consumer attitudes on autonomous vehicles are changing, too. Nearly half, or 48.3%, of respondents said they expect autonomous vehicles to be their main rideshare — up from 24% in June.\n\n\"I think that the novelty of riding a robotaxi or an autonomous vehicle has started to wear off in the San Francisco market, and I think that's a good thing,\" Anburjan said. \"More people trust the cars now.\"",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

    "fullText": "An incident that underscores both the promise and the growing pains of EV (electric vehicle) ownership just played out on camera. A Tesla driver’s routine stop at a public charging station turned into a frustrating episode, and the moment was immortalized on vehicle security cameras.\n\nThe story, first shared by the owner on the Reddit forum r/TeslaModelY, quickly spread through EV and automotive circles, lighting debates over charging-station security, equipment vulnerability, and even the readiness of public infrastructure for mass EV adoption.\n\nWe recently reported an emerging trend of EV charger thefts, targeted for their copper, and costing charging stations hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacement costs.\n\nIn this story, the owner reported plugging in at a public charger and stepping away for roughly 30 minutes — only to return and find that a critical charging accessory had been stolen. The item taken was a J1772 adapter, an essential piece of hardware that allows Tesla drivers to connect to non-Tesla charging stations.\n\nBeyond the theft itself, what made this more than just a petty theft story was how the incident was captured. The Tesla’s built-in surveillance, a combination of Sentry Mode and external cameras designed to protect the vehicle, recorded the interaction.\n\nAnd that’s how the owner and others in the EV community could see exactly what happened. The video showed a woman approaching the car and removing the adapter — an act that, until now, many drivers assumed would be deterred by Tesla’s lock-in features that secure charging ports.\n\nIn follow-up comments, the Tesla owner explained that they were unaware the locking feature had not been enabled. Unfortunately, that small oversight came with significant consequence. After sharing the footage, the owner managed to locate and recover the adapter, and plans to enable the lock feature on future visits.\n\nNot merely a quirky footnote in the life of a Tesla owner, this story reflects broader stresses in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem.\n\nA sustained EV proliferation will sustain increasing demand for public charging infrastructure. Early adopters often praise the environmental benefits and futuristic tech of EVs, but incidents like this, however seemingly inconsequential, can further undermine confidence in the reliability and security of the charging network. This is especially the case with cautious EV converts still on the fence.\n\nCharging stations, especially those maintained by third-party providers or local councils, are typically unmanned and scattered across public spaces such as shopping centers, highway rest stops, and municipal lots. Unlike a fuel pump at a gas station — where attendants, lighting, and surveillance have evolved over decades — EV chargers are still figuring out the human and security infrastructure needed to go with the hardware.\n\nThis gap has proven to make them ripe targets for theft, vandalism, and misuse. It used to be that the main complaint was about EV owners who treat charging stations as car-sitters; now people have to worry about their chargers being targets for thieves.\n\nTeslas are famous for their advanced camera systems and a mode called Sentry Mode, which uses the car’s exterior cameras to monitor and record suspicious activity around the car when left unattended.\n\nOriginally designed to combat vandalism and break-ins, Sentry Mode has, over the years, captured everything from graffiti attacks to attempted thefts. It has proven a powerful tool for owners and, in some cases, law enforcement.\n\nYet this very bounty of data raises questions deeper than whether thieves might target an adapter. As more incidents are recorded and shared online, concerns about privacy, data usage, and surveillance are surfacing in tandem.\n\nCameras ‘catch’ a thief snatching a charger, and people suddenly remember that Tesla and other automakers amass enormous amounts of footage and sensor data that, while invaluable in cases of vandalism or accident reconstruction, could also be mishandled or misused.\n\nAn insurer says they’re cutting prices in half for cars running FSD (Tesla’s full self-driving technology), and we’re wondering what that means for driving data being shared with an insurance provider. That tension has already drawn scrutiny and criticism from privacy advocates.\n\nGirl stole my J1772 adapter\nbyu/uglah inTeslaModelY\n\nThere are several key takeaways for the average Tesla or EV owner:\n\nEnable all available security features — including charging port locks and Sentry Mode — to deter theft and protect equipment.\n\nBe aware of the surrounding environment when using public chargers; well-lit, high-traffic areas will always be safer.\n\nRecord and share incidents responsibly — community vigilance helps highlight weaknesses in public infrastructure and encourages operators to step up security.\n\nThis episode offers a snapshot of an industry in transition. A growing EV adoption will expose gaps in charging security, public awareness, and infrastructure readiness. It’s normal, and stories like this, amplified by social media and the built-in cameras of the vehicles themselves, help reveal how advanced driver-owned tech has become and how imperfect the human and civic systems around it still are.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "description": "My front camera had problems with condensation, especially in direct, low sunlight. Tesla cleaned it, but this could be a challenge for full autonomy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla offered a free trial of its FSD system in December. I was driven autonomously for most of the month and came away with new insights.\n\nThe latest software was impressive, but my experience revealed a glaring problem that could hamper Tesla's path toward a full, unsupervised Robotaxi service.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. I have a Model 3 Performance with HW4 hardware. It doesn't have a camera near the front bumper, but otherwise it's modern hardware. I also have an up-to-date version of FSD.\n\nThis combination resulted in an amazing FSD experience. I drove from Silicon Valley to Lake Tahoe in supervised autonomous mode and had no issues. I drove into SF and back several times, trouble-free.\n\nI estimate 90% to 95% of my driving was in FSD mode during December. It's a new state of driving that I think is safer than human driving. I spend less time worrying about where I'm going and which turn to make. Instead, my eyes are on the road and my hands are ready near the wheel, just in case.\n\nDespite the ability to text while being driven now, I pay more attention to the road in FSD mode, not less.\n\nA surprise bonus: I argue (OK, debate!) less with my wife about directions when we are on FSD-powered trips together. There's no discussion about whether this or that route is better. FSD just does it. This reduces the potential for marital spats. That's probably worth the entire $100-a-month FSD subscription cost.\n\nWhen Tesla told me my month-long trial was ending, I was genuinely disappointed. Do I pay monthly now? No. But I don't drive enough at the moment. If my wife's or my commute becomes much longer, we would certainly pay.\n\nThis was all supervised autonomous driving. That means Tesla requires human owners to be at the wheel and alert at all times.\n\nUnsupervised autonomy is the next frontier. That's when cars drive themselves with no human at the wheel. Waymo already does this in Silicon Valley and a few other urban areas in the US. Tesla's Robotaxi service started doing this in Austin recently, but elsewhere, these Robotaxis still have safety drivers behind the wheel.\n\nMaking this leap is a huge feat. And Tesla is trying to do this with a purely camera-based system, while Waymo uses cameras, Lidar, and other sensors that are not just vision-based.\n\nThis is the big schism in the industry. Backers of the multi-sensor approach say their systems are better and safer because components such as Lidar collect data without \"seeing,\" so they work in more environments. However, this is more expensive than camera-only systems.\n\nTesla's approach is cheaper, so that's good for efficiently mass-producing millions of robotaxis, such as the upcoming Cybercab. But, can camera-only systems actually work as well in unsupervised situations?\n\nThis is where my December FSD experience sowed some seeds of doubt in my mind. To be clear, I'm not an expert. I'm a huge fan of my Tesla vehicle, and I hope both autonomous approaches work and make roads safer. Still, here's what happened last month.\n\nThe main front camera at the top of my windshield sometimes gets condensation, dust, or dirt inside the glass and plastic compartment.\n\nA couple of times, when I was in FSD mode and being driven into the low sun, I got a loud, red warning sign on the screen of my Tesla telling me to take over immediately or the system would pull over. I took the wheel quickly with no further issues and restarted FSD soon after.\n\nBut these incidents were slightly unsettling. My interpretation is that sunlight was streaming into the front camera compartment, and the glare was combining with condensation and/or dust to degrade the quality of the images being collected.\n\nA week or so later, I got an alert from Tesla to bring my vehicle in for a service. The goal was to clean the inside of the front camera. I set up an appointment, which the Tesla app told me would cost $60.\n\nI took it to a nearby Tesla location, and the cleaning lasted about an hour. Tesla didn't charge me. After that, I didn't get any red warning signs for the rest of December while using FSD.\n\nThis front camera is not easy to clean because it has a housing around it, which might also trap moisture that could otherwise dissipate more easily from the car's interior.\n\nIf Tesla wants its cars to be fully unsupervised Robotaxis, a front interior camera that fogs up and needs to be professionally cleaned seems like a potentially big problem. With a million Robotaxis on the road, how many times might Tesla service employees have to clean these cameras?\n\nThis also suggests that a multi-sensor approach — that doesn't 100% rely on cameras that need cleaning — might be a better way to attain full autonomy at scale.\n\nThere are signs that Tesla may already be responding to this issue, as it gets more experience running its Robotaxi service.\n\nIn September, Elon Musk wrote on X that keeping the front camera clean is \"a major area of focus.\"\n\nAbout a month later, the company rolled out a software update that enabled the windshield wipers to do extra wiping around the front camera. You can see it in action here. That only addressed exterior dirt and moisture, though.\n\nMore recently, Tesla Robotaxis have been spotted with new cleaning systems that squirt water onto the outside cameras to clean them.\n\nMore importantly, there's a new setup for the front camera behind the windshield, according to photos posted on X recently by Tesla investor and owner Sawyer Merritt.\n\n\"Black lines surrounding the entire front camera housing, which could mean improved sealing to prevent off-gassing inside the car from fogging the cameras, potentially eliminating the need for Tesla to perform front camera cleanings (just speculation),\" he wrote.\n\nAnother Tesla owner posted a photo this week of a new Model Y with an updated front camera housing.\n\nTesla also has a patent for a new way of preventing front camera glare, for use in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The glare shield features a textured surface composed of an array of micro-cones, or cone-shaped formations, which serve to scatter incident light in various directions, thereby reducing glare and improving camera vision,\" Tesla wrote in the patent filing.\n\nIt's unclear how well these fixes will work. But Tesla is obviously trying hard to address these challenges. Its camera-only approach depends on it.\n\nI asked Tesla and Elon Musk all about this on Monday in a detailed email. They didn't respond by publication time on Tuesday morning.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Tesla removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full-self driving) subscriptions.",
    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full self-driving) subscriptions.\n\nPer Tesla’s website, new orders for Tesla’s entry-level models no longer offer Autopilot as a standard option, now only offering a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, essentially an adaptive cruise control that allows the vehicle to change speeds when following another car on the highway.\n\nPreviously, Autopilot offered Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and auto-steer, which allowed the car to stay centered in its lane and change lanes using the turn signals.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Tesla removed Autopilot as it faced a suspension of its dealer license in California stemming from a ruling that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing over claims about Autopilot and FSD. The ruling was stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla time to comply, namely to change marketing practices around the software.\n\nThe change comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week the company would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for FSD, pushing instead to a monthly subscription offering of $99 per month, which was already an option.\n\nMusk said late Thursday night the price of FSD could rise as well.\n\n“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” he said on X.com. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”\n\nPulling Autopilot from Tesla EVs is a notable move considering other automakers, including Toyota, offer such services as standard options in their vehicles. On the flip side, the move to focus on FSD may be the right one considering Autopilot was an older technology and, per Musk dictates, FSD was Tesla's autonomous future.\n\nInterestingly, one X.com user posited Tesla’s move to pull Autopilot was tied to Musk’s new compensation plan, one that required a milestone of 10 million paying FSD subscribers.\n\nYesterday, Tesla stock popped when Musk announced the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla appears to be getting closer to deploying Optimus in its factories — and Austin is the next training ground.\n\nTesla told workers during a town hall last week that it plans to begin collecting data to train its humanoid robot at its Austin Gigafactory, insiders told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is looking to train Optimus how to operate in the Texas facility, it said, adding that it was targeting a February start date.\n\nTesla has been collecting data and training Optimus prototypes in its Fremont, California, factory for more than a year.\n\nThe Optimus data collectors in Fremont are typically kept separate from the general factory workers to avoid interfering with output, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nThere, data collectors have recorded themselves organizing vehicle parts and working on conveyor belts, Business Insider previously reported. The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing \"simple tasks\" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.\n\n\"By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,\" he said. \"By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.\"\n\nHe warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.\n\nTesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.\n\nLast year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nMusk has pitched Optimus as the \"biggest product of all time.\" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.\n\nThe town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.\n\nOver the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "Tesla's car sales may have struggled recently, but Morgan Stanley says a recent update in the insurance space is a positive signal for the real bull case for Tesla stock: autonomous driving.\n\nOnline insurance provider Lemonade announced the launch of a new product for self-driving cars this week. The Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance will begin with a 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when their vehicle's autonomous driving software is in control.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say this is a \"critical unlock\" for Tesla and the broader self-driving car market. It indicates that insurance providers may finally be gaining confidence in autonomous technology.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to autonomous driving has been insurance providers' reluctance. High uncertainty regarding liability and risk has prompted many companies to avoid insuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities.\n\nLemonade's decision to start ensuring Tesla vehicles equipped with the tech might mark a breakthrough, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"This is an important shift in how insurers treat advanced driver-assistance and autonomy features,\" he said. \"Lemonade's approach suggests growing confidence in the data coming from Tesla's fleet, using real-world driving outcomes to assess safety performance rather than relying solely on theoretical or regulatory classifications.\"\n\nWhile Lemonade's announcement is specific to Tesla cars for now, the EV leader is seen as a bellwether for the autonomous driving industry. Percoco added that he expects more companies to follow Lemonade and start insuring self-driving cars.\n\n\"Lemonade's announcement points toward a future in which insurance becomes one of the clearest market-based validators of autonomous driving progress,\" he wrote.\n\nWith Tesla's electric vehicle sales down for two consecutive years, Elon Musk is betting big on autonomous driving, and investors see the technology as the primary justification for the stock's premium valuation. More accessible insurance could hasten the adoption of autonomous driving tech.\n\n\"As insurers incorporate increasingly granular driving data into pricing, technologies that demonstrably reduce risk should be rewarded faster and more transparently,\" he noted. \"For Tesla, this marks another step toward external recognition that FSD is moving from an experimental feature to an economically relevant safety system.\"",

    "description": "Other brands will continue to offer similar features at no extra cost.",
    "fullText": "If you're in the market for a new Tesla, your fancy new electric car is going to be a little less smart—unless you pony up for a subscription. According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to \n\nBefore, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).\n\nNow, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\n\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.\n\nWhich features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n\nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.\n\nAt any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.",

The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, \"I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.\"\n\n\"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),\" he said.\n\nTesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.\n\nCustomers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.\n\nThe executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.\n\nMost of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.\n\nAs of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.\n\nThe move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.\n\nIt comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.\n\nAdoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nTesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects \"unsupervised\" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Business Insider tested Tesla's Full Self-Driving system and found it a highly capable driver assistance feature. Full autonomy will be a game changer.",
    "fullText": "Two things can be true of Tesla's Full Self-Driving: It's an impressive piece of technology, and it still doesn't go far enough.\n\nFSD is Tesla's big bet. CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.\n\nToday, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.\n\nThe gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.\n\nI recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.\n\nWith my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.\n\nFSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.\n\nI drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.\n\nOne was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\n\nFSD's \"Mad Max\" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it \"Mad Max\" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.\n\nAt no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nMy friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a \"spaceship.\" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.\n\nI gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.\n\nThe car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.\n\nAs good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.\n\nPeople who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.\n\nI agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.\n\nThe problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.\n\nI obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?\n\nFSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.\n\nMusk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.\n\nThat would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.\n\nI have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.\n\nThat's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.\n\nI'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.\n\nTesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.",

This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "A Tesla owner took to Reddit to vent frustration after their vehicle's cameras captured a woman stealing a key charging accessory not long after the car was plugged in. While the incident ended without permanent loss, it highlights a growing concern around electric vehicles and charging station vandalism or theft.\n\nThe situation was shared in the r/TeslaModelY forum, and the owner said the theft took place \"30 min after [they] plugged in.\" They also shared a video.\n\nThe stolen item was a J1772 adapter, a small but essential piece of equipment for many Tesla drivers. The adapter allows Tesla vehicles to connect to non-Tesla EV charging stations, making it especially valuable for drivers who rely on public infrastructure.\n\nSeveral commenters noted that someone shouldn't have been able to steal the adapter due to Tesla's technology. According to the OP, they were unaware that Tesla vehicles have a locking feature that can secure the adapter while charging, preventing it from being removed by someone else.\n\nIncidents like this can discourage new drivers from adopting EVs, particularly those who have concerns about charging access, reliability, and security. If people fear that charging equipment can be easily damaged or stolen, it undermines confidence in the infrastructure needed to support wider EV adoption.\n\nThe hesitation is problematic because EVs play a crucial role in reducing reliance on gas and oil. Critics often argue that EVs can be just as polluting as internal combustion vehicles due to battery manufacturing or electricity generation. However, numerous studies show that even EVs charged on the dirtiest grids still produce less lifetime pollution than gas-powered cars.\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the owner shared a positive update: They managed to track down the woman and recover the adapter, adding that they plan to contact their local dealership to make sure the locking feature is enabled.\n\nAs EV ownership grows, addressing vandalism, educating drivers on built-in security features, and continuing to expand secure charging infrastructure will be key to ensuring cleaner transportation can scale effectively.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) just delivered a rare double whammy to Nvidia (NVDA) over the past weekend.\n\nCEO Elon Musk revealed that Tesla’s much-talked-about AI5 self-driving chips are nearly complete, and that the next one, A16, is already underway.\n\nWith the AI inference part covered, Musk said Sunday on X that Dojo 3 is being restarted, pushing Tesla back into large-scale AI training after previously pulling back.\n\nNvidia threw the first punch, though, when it rolled out “Alpamayo” at CES 2026 (an open-source autonomous vehicle AI toolkit), aiming to become the default autonomy platform powering a ton of brands.\n\nMusk responded swiftly, downplaying the risk.\n\nClearly, this is a mighty interesting time for the AV industry, with the tug-of-war between two giants in Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nFor Tesla, it’s all about building a closed loop that covers the entire AV stack.\n\nTesla-designed in-car compute (this includes AI5, which is “nearly done,” and the AI6, which is already underway)\n\nTesla’s camera-first software stack\n\nTesla’s data flywheel is powered by its own fleet\n\nSo for Tesla, it’s all about keeping the autonomy part within its potent ecosystem, as Nvidia looks to power everyone else.\n\nFor investors, these promises aren’t new, which makes the follow-through all the more critical.\n\nTesla is looking to tighten its grip on the hardware behind self-driving.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nForget Blackwell, Nvidia future is Vera Rubin, agentic software\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nMusk announced on Saturday in an X post that the EV giant is nearing completion of its AI5 self-driving computer chip, and that the AI6 is already in development.\n\nAccording to Musk, the AI5 chips, which are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, will enter high-volume production in 2027, replacing the AI4 hardware. Also, Tesla has lined up Samsung Electronics for U.S.-based chip manufacturing.\n\nIt’s pretty easy to get lost in the AI jargon, so it’s important to be clear about things at each step about what’s happening.\n\nThe A15 and A16 move is essentially about “inference at the edge”. That’s basically running Tesla’s Full Self-Driving neural nets inside the car, instead of relying on a third-party compute stack.",

    "title": "Woman Plugs In Tesla With 110 Miles of Charge at Wawa. Then It Immediately Dies, Locking Her In: ‘There Was No Air Circulating’",
    "description": "“Nothing was working. Not even the button to get out.”",
    "fullText": "Fast charging is supposed to add energy, not take it away. But for one Tesla Model Y owner, plugging in at a brand-new Wawa charger triggered an abrupt shutdown that left her asking how a car with plenty of range could suddenly go dark.\n\nIn a TikTok packed with guidance and warnings for Tesla owners, creator Emma Renee @the.emmarenee shares the details of her and her 15-year-old son becoming temporarily trapped in the car and then locked out, despite indications that it was charged for over 100 more miles of travel.\n\n“I literally plugged it up, had about 110 miles on it to drive, sat here for three seconds and it stated, ‘Vehicle power reduced. Powering down,\" she says in the clip. “Nothing was working. Not even the button to get out.”\n\nThe video quickly struck a nerve with EV owners, many of whom were confused by how a vehicle showing more than 100 miles of remaining range could abruptly lose power. As several commenters pointed out, the issue did not appear to involve the main high-voltage battery that powers the Tesla Model Y’s drivetrain, but rather the vehicle’s low-voltage electrical system.\n\nModern Teslas, like most electric vehicles, rely on a separate low-voltage battery—traditionally a 12-volt unit, though newer models have transitioned to lithium-ion systems—to operate essential functions such as door locks, infotainment screens, and control modules. If that system fails, the vehicle can become largely unresponsive even if the main battery pack is fully charged.\n\nIn her replies to commenters, Emma Renee said technicians at a Tesla service center later attributed the failure to a charging-port fault that shorted the low-voltage system, rather than a spontaneous battery failure.\n\nViewers quickly flooded the comments section with theories, many pointing to a familiar culprit. “12v battery needs replaced,” one commenter wrote, echoing dozens of similar responses. Others noted that internal combustion vehicles can also become disabled when their accessory batteries fail, though mechanical door handles typically remain operable in those cases.\n\nLow-voltage battery failures are a known issue across the automotive industry, and Tesla has acknowledged that earlier lead-acid units often need replacement after two to four years of service. In response, the automaker began rolling out lithium-ion low-voltage batteries in newer vehicles, including updated versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, to improve longevity and reliability.\n\nStill, Emma Renee maintained that her vehicle had under 20,000 miles at the time, and said Tesla replaced multiple components following the incident. She also emphasized that the charger itself was newly installed at a recently opened Wawa, raising questions about whether a fault during the charging handshake could have triggered the shutdown.\n\nOne of the most debated aspects of the video involved emergency door releases, particularly for rear-seat passengers. In the clip, the creator initially stated that the back seats lacked an emergency latch, a claim that many commenters disputed.\n\nTesla vehicles do include manual emergency releases for rear doors, but unlike the front doors, they are often hidden inside door pockets or beneath trim panels. Tesla’s own owner documentation notes that these releases are intentionally concealed to reduce the risk of accidental activation, especially by children.\n\nWhile several commenters criticized the creator for not knowing where the rear releases were located, others acknowledged that the design can be difficult to locate under stress. Some owners said they had added aftermarket labels or glow-in-the-dark markers to make the releases easier to find in an emergency.\n\nIn later comments, Emma Renee clarified that her primary concern was not her own exit, but the possibility of someone, such as her grandmother, being trapped in the back seat without guidance during a similar failure.\n\nDespite the video's dramatic nature, the incident does not appear to indicate a widespread defect or a new failure affecting Tesla vehicles. There are no recalls tied to charging-port–induced shutdowns, nor have regulators flagged similar incidents at Wawa charging locations.\n\nInstead, experts generally describe these scenarios as cascading electrical failures, in which a fault in one component, such as a low-voltage battery or charging interface, triggers the vehicle to shut down as a protective measure. Because EVs rely heavily on electronic systems rather than mechanical linkages, the effects can feel more abrupt to drivers unfamiliar with the architecture.\n\nThat distinction matters, particularly as viral videos can blur the line between rare cases and everyday risk. A vehicle losing electronic functionality while stationary is fundamentally different from a propulsion failure at speed, and there is no indication that the Model Y in this case posed a driving hazard before it powered down.\n\nThe incident has nonetheless sparked renewed discussion about owner education, emergency preparedness, and how clearly manufacturers communicate fail-safe features. It also underscores how EV adoption increasingly depends on trust, not just technology. As charging infrastructure expands and vehicles become more software-dependent, even uncommon failures can feel alarming when they challenge basic expectations about control and access.\n\nFor this Tesla owner, the experience ended with a tow truck and a repair, not an injury. But the video highlights how moments like these resonate far beyond a single parking lot, shaping perceptions of electric vehicles one clip at a time.\n\nInsideEVs reached out to Emma Renee via direct message and comment on the clip. We’ll update this if she responds.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established ​Canadian sales network, experts say.\n\nUnder the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually ‌from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.\n\nHowever, under one clause ‌in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.\n\nWhile many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.\n\nThe U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car ⁠from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles ‌from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.\n\nBut it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing ‍a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.\n\nNow, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.\n\n\"This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nTesla ​has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence ‌there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.\n\n\"Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,\" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.\n\nOther brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both ⁠owned by China's automaking group Geely.",

    "description": "Tesla owners' reactions to Elon Musk's announcement that FSD would only be available for $99 a month ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

    "description": "Conventional trucks are so slow, they can block other motorists from passing and slow down the speed of traffic.",
    "fullText": "So far, electric vehicle giant Tesla has focused on developing the next generation of passenger vehicles. But, a video released on Twitter shows the power and capacity of Tesla's new Semi truck as it easily drives up a steep hill on the Donner Pass.\n\nConventional diesel semitrucks have historically struggled to get up to highway speed going up steep slopes. Many of them may reach only 60 miles per hour within 30 seconds, which can block other motorists from passing and slow down the speed of traffic. The Tesla Semi, in comparison, can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 20 seconds.\n\nTesla currently uses its semitrucks to carry materials between its California and Nevada facilities. Therefore, it's likely the Semi recorded in the video was carrying freight.\n\nBesides the apparent benefits of traversing across graded surfaces, Tesla's Semi may also revolutionize the trucking and hauling industry in terms of emissions. Combination trucks account for nearly 18% of motor vehicle emissions nationwide. Tesla's Semi has a smaller footprint and opens up the opportunity to be powered by alternative renewable sources like solar and wind.\n\nThe Semi uses 2 kilowatt hours of energy per mile and can travel up to 500 miles before needing a charge. Like its smaller EV counterparts, the Semi needs to charge for only 30 minutes to recover 70% of its range capacity.\n\nTrucking companies will see drastic financial returns from purchasing electric Semis rather than diesel vehicles. The company estimates buyers will save more than $200,000 on fuel in the first three years of ownership. The remote diagnostic system also decreases the maintenance and repairs needed on the vehicle, suggesting that the long-term cost of owning one may be more optimal than an internal combustion engine.\n\nThe first Tesla Semis were sold to PepsiCo in 2022, and Tesla remains one of the predominant users of the vehicles for its own trucking purposes. The company expects more of its Semis to be on the road in the coming years.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The billionaire said owners will no longer be able to buy Tesla FSD as a one-off $8,000 purchase from February 14.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has a Valentine's Day present for Tesla owners: another subscription.\n\nThe billionaire said on Wednesday that Tesla will stop making its Full Self-Driving feature available as a one-off purchase and will only offer the assisted driving software as a subscription service.\n\n\"Tesla will stop selling FSD after Feb 14. FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,\" the Tesla CEO wrote in a post on X.\n\nTesla owners currently have the option to buy FSD for $8,000 or pay $99 a month to access the service.\n\nIt comes as the company struggles to get customers to pay for the technology, which Musk has regularly described as critical to Tesla's future.\n\nIn Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, the company's CFO told investors that only around 12% of Tesla's current fleet subscribed to FSD, with quarterly revenue decreasing compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key part of Musk's mammoth pay package, which was approved by Tesla investors in November. Reaching 10 million FSD subscriptions is among the milestones that Tesla needs to hit for Musk to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nThe company's rollout of Full Self-Driving, which allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself in most situations but requires human supervision at all times, has attracted regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced investigations last year into whether Tesla correctly reported crashes linked to FSD, and over reports of Tesla vehicles with FSD activated running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTesla also faces a potential ban on selling vehicles in California after a judge ruled that the company's marketing of its Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems misled consumers.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "With US federal EV incentives gone, Tesla gets back to dominating the US market. It's all about volume and EV manufacturing scale.",
    "fullText": "Federal incentives for electric vehicles disappeared at the end of the third quarter, leaving the US market to survive on its own merits.\n\nSo, how did companies perform in this new, realistic environment?\n\nCox Automotive, an industry data provider, has just released EV sales estimates for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, and the numbers reveal which companies thrive and which struggle without government assistance.\n\nTesla once again dominates the EV market in the US. Its market share surged to 59% in Q4, up from 41% in the previous quarter, Cox data shows.\n\nOne major reason is that EV companies in the US now have to make the numbers work without government help. A significant part of the equation is volume.\n\nDespite a decline in sales recently, Tesla still sold 138,000 EVs in the US during the fourth quarter. That type of volume helps the company maintain relatively low prices while still making money.\n\nMost rivals don't have that volume, and their EV manufacturing operations just aren't as efficient as Tesla's because they still make other types of cars, which have way more parts than EVs. This can make them more expensive to manufacture and can lead to big losses.\n\n\"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,\" Cox warned last year as federal incentives ended.\n\nFord's EV market share was measly 6% in the fourth quarter, while Rivian's stood at just 4%.\n\nGeneral Motors is performing somewhat better, with a market share of over 10%. Even here, the math just doesn't add up. General Motors took $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.\n\nIn December, Ford abandoned large EVs because it couldn't make a profit on them. The company took a $20 billion write-down on its failing EV business. Rivian still loses a lot of money, although its cheaper R2 EV might improve things later this year.\n\nIn July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.\n\nIf EV operations can't reach high-volume scale, they risk constantly losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding. When incentives ended in the US, many players decided to give up.\n\nTesla remains the exception in the US. It's proving that, in this industry, volume equals survival.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "Tesla's Cybertruck is falling far short of Elon Musk's ambitious sales targets",
    "description": "Sales of the Cybertruck were far below the 250,000 annual target Musk set before the electric pickup rolled off the production line in 2023.",
    "fullText": "The Cybertruck is running out of road.\n\nTesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in the US last year, according to data from Cox Automotive released on Tuesday, as demand for Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup fizzled.\n\nThat's nearly half the number Tesla sold in 2024, and sales dropped 68% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nThe figures are a far cry from the target of 250,000 sales a year Musk set before the Cybertruck rolled off the production line in 2023.\n\nThe divisive electric truck amassed over 1 million reservations, but early models launched with a price tag of over $79,000, significantly higher than the nearly $40,000 sticker price Musk had floated in 2019.\n\nSince then, demand has been underwhelming — and collapsing sales have not been the only speed bump.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced a series of quality issues, with 10 recalls since 2023.\n\nWhile some of those issues have been fixed with a simple software update, others have proved more problematic. Tesla has issued recalls for accelerator pedals that could get trapped at full throttle, an optional off-road light bar that may detach and fly off the truck, and the Cybertruck's comically large windshield wiper failing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck's highly distinctive design, which caused Tesla significant production issues, has had the unintended effect of turning the angular EV into a target.\n\nMultiple Cybertruck owners told Business Insider last March that they had been hit by vandalism and verbal harassment amid the backlash over Tesla CEO Musk's federal cost-cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla has employed some creative strategies for turning around the Cybertruck's sales slump.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported in April that the EV giant was quietly rebranding the futuristic pickup as a working man's truck. And SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, has taken delivery of an unspecified number of Cybertrucks.\n\nUnlike Tesla's other vehicles, however, the Cybertruck is only available in a limited number of countries.\n\nTesla sells the pickup in Mexico and Canada, and recently started sales in Korea, but the Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel body and sharp edges make it almost impossible to sell in Europe and China, two of the EV giant's largest markets.\n\nTesla also launched the Cybertruck in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last year — three oil-rich nations where chargers are scarce, and EV sales are low.\n\nThe Cybertruck's woes mean it is unlikely to help Tesla turn around its global sales slump. Sales of all Tesla vehicles declined for the second consecutive year in 2025, with Chinese rival BYD surpassing it to become the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nMusk is not the only one to see ambitious plans for big electric pickups fall flat.\n\nFord sold just over 27,000 of its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck in 2025 and last month announced that it would replace the EV with an extended-range hybrid offering 700 miles of range.\n\nOther automakers have also backed away from electric pickups as an \"EV winter\" has taken hold in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nStellantis canceled plans to build an all-electric RAM truck in September, while Ford and GM have signalled they plan to build more gas-powered pickups as they rack up billions of dollars in charges over their EV strategy shifts.\n\nWhat the future holds for the Cybertruck is unclear. Tesla quietly removed the option to buy a cheaper, rear-wheel drive trim from its website after just five months in September, and there has been no word on mooted plans to build a smaller version of the truck, which still starts at around $80,000 in the US.\n\nPublicly, Musk doesn't seem bothered by the Cybertruck's low sales, regularly praising the stainless-steel truck on his X feed.\n\n\"Cybertruck is an incredible vehicle. Our best ever from Tesla,\" he wrote last month.",

    "description": "David Moss, a Tesla owner since 2024, said he traveled 11,000 miles across the US with Full Self-Driving. He said FSD is indispensable.",
    "fullText": "David Moss, 28, has been a Tesla owner since March 2024.\n\nMoss said Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) was the number one purchase driver.\n\nHe says he has traveled more than 11,000 miles across the US without touching the steering wheel.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Moss, 28, a resident of Puyallup, Washington, who has been documenting his experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Moss told Business Insider that he does not own Tesla stock.\n\nBusiness Insider verified Moss's travel logs, charging stops, and FSD mileage data that is displayed on his car. Tesla only displays FSD usage down to the 10th of a mile.\n\nI've owned a Tesla since March 2024.\n\nTesla's Full Self-Driving feature was the primary reason I made the purchase. I would say the electric aspect is almost an inconvenience, and FSD is my main interest in the Tesla.\n\nCharging around my hometown isn't a pain. There's a station near my house, and I have a charger at home.\n\nHowever, my commutes are long. I'm a product manager for a company that makes 3D lidar scanners, and a lot of my job is visiting clients on-site all around America.\n\nI drive over 50,000 miles a year. Given the number of miles I drive, an electric car is a slower form of transportation than a gas car.\n\nMy first Tesla was a Cybertruck, but unfortunately, I totaled it in August while I was driving it in off-road mode. In September, I bought the long-range Model 3. The company was running a promotion where if you bought a Model 3 before the tax credit expired, you got a free year of charging.\n\nSince then, I've put over 23,000 miles on the car. So I've been making good use of the free electricity.\n\nI began a road trip on October 28 and have since driven 18,741 miles.\n\nAround November 25, while I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, I got the FSD version 14.2 update and have driven over 11,000 miles without any intervention as of December 31.\n\nWhen I say no intervention, I mean down to the 10th of a mile — 100% no steering wheel or pedal touches. That includes parking and getting into a charging station.\n\nFSD navigated restaurants, supercharger stations, office complexes — every single part of the drive.\n\nDuring the trip, I've gone down several dirt roads and construction zones that had cones, reroutes, and road closures. One morning, I was in Reno, leaving my hotel, and the normal road was closed for construction. The car immediately turned around and found an alternative route.\n\nOne of the more interesting cases was in Wyoming during a severe windstorm.\n\nThere were alerts, warning of 80 mph winds. In about a hundred-mile stretch, I saw six different tipped-over semi-trucks.\n\nI was a little nervous about driving on the freeway with high-wind caution alerts, but FSD handled everything while I was on Interstate 80, traveling from Cheyenne to Evanston. FSD drove without even touching a lane marker once.\n\nI think in that situation, FSD shone more than usual.\n\nSince Raleigh, I've traveled across the country — down to Miami, across Texas, through the Rockies, and up to Medford, Oregon.\n\nAfter a two-day pit stop back in my hometown in Washington for Christmas Eve, I headed to Los Angeles and drove across the US until I hit South Carolina.\n\nI put on a lot of audiobooks and podcasts while FSD drives. I also took business calls or calls with friends and family.\n\nI haven't tested out being on my phone with my eyes off the road. That's still against the law, and it's just not worth the risk.\n\nI've never dozed off during the drive, but I'm also not constantly on the edge of my seat or grimacing while FSD is on.\n\nI'm a million times less scared than I've ever been in an Uber ride or with most of my friends. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the most pleasant driving I've experienced.\n\nWhen I started my road trip on October 28, my Tesla was on FSD version 13.2.9.\n\nEventually, when I was in the southern part of Alberta in Canada, I installed version 14.1. That was around the evening of November 5. Around November 25, I got 14.2.\n\nI have a Starlink Mini mounted underneath my Tesla's glass roof, allowing me to download updates remotely and install them while I sleep in my hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't call the difference between 14.1 and 14.2 a grand night-and-day difference, but there's definitely been a noticeable improvement under version 14: the ability to park, more speed profiles like \"Sloth\" and \"Mad Max\" mode, and just the overall smoothness.\n\nFor the first time, with 14.2, I was able to win people over when I showed FSD to my friends and family. Before they were like, \"Oh, that's kind of cool,\" \"It's a gimmick,\" or \"I'm not going to buy this.\" Now, they're saying, \"Oh wow, I actually need that.\"\n\nI can't speak enough about how much I love FSD and how much it inconveniences me to drive.\n\nA lot of the driving I currently do is simply because I don't want to fly. Because I know that when I arrive at the airport, I'm likely not going to be able to rent a car with FSD.\n\nThe record-setting was never really the focus.\n\nI didn't even check the FSD stat page for several hundred miles before I started seeing people post about it online, saying, \"Oh wow, I've actually not touched the wheel at all.\"\n\nAt this point, a technology like FSD is indispensable to having a car. The feature provides me with peace of mind, having that \"extra set of eyes\" on the road.\n\nThere's also a personal side to that because my father is legally blind and can't operate a vehicle. If there were one day an unsupervised Cybercab that he could buy, we'd buy it on day one.\n\nMy father's ecstatic. He believes he's one day closer to gaining his independence.",

    "description": "The class-action lawsuit is the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered door handles.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is facing more heat over its famously flush door handles.\n\nThe automaker was hit with a class-action lawsuit over door handle failures in its Model S EV on Friday, the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered handles.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida by John Urban, a Maitland-based Tesla owner, on behalf of those who had purchased or leased a 2014-2016 Model S.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the \"flush\" door handles on Tesla's luxury sedan, which are designed to pop out when the driver approaches, \"routinely fail\" after only a few years of use, leaving owners unable to get into the vehicle and creating a \"significant safety risk\" by potentially locking them out in emergency situations.\n\nThree out of the four door handles on Urban's 2015 Model S \"Ludicrous\" variant had failed by 2022, the complaint said, including the driver's seat door handle, forcing the Florida resident to climb over from the passenger side while he waited for repairs.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Tesla \"knew or should have known\" about the \"defective\" handles. It pointed to the automaker redesigning the door handles on post-2016 Model S vehicles to make them more reliable, adding that more recent models rarely experience the defect.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's the latest legal action Tesla has faced over the design of its door handles. The EV giant was among the first to pioneer electronically powered handles that sit flush against the car's surface, and this feature was a major selling point for the company's early models.\n\nHowever, multiple lawsuits have alleged that Tesla's electronic handles can become inoperable when the vehicle's low-voltage battery dies, trapping passengers inside during an emergency.\n\nIn October, the parents of two college students killed in a Cybertruck crash in California sued the company, alleging that the victims were trapped inside the burning vehicle after power to the Cybertruck's electric door failed.\n\nA month later, Tesla was sued by the family of two Wisconsin residents who died after their 2016 Model S crashed into a tree, with the lawsuit also alleging that the vehicle's door handle system failed during the crash.\n\nThe Texas-based automaker is also under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after some Model Y owners reported that their children had been trapped inside after the door handles failed.\n\nTesla's vehicles do include manual door releases, but critics have said that these can be difficult to access during an emergency situation. Franz von Holzhausen, the company's chief designer, told Bloomberg last September that Tesla was redesigning its door handles to provide more obvious manual controls.\n\nThe issue has also drawn political scrutiny, with one US House Rep. introducing a bill last week that would force automakers to include \"easy-to-find manual releases\" on all car doors.\n\nIn a new safety page on Tesla's website added last month, the company said its vehicles' doors would automatically unlock for emergency access, but added in a footnote that certain safety features may not be available for all vehicles based on build date.",

    "description": "Elon Musk is staring down several self-imposed deadlines this year, from Cybercab volume production to a much-hyped Roadster demo.",
    "fullText": "It's a critical year for Tesla. Elon Musk says so.\n\nIn earnings calls, podcast interviews, and a steady stream of posts on X, the outspoken CEO has spent the past year teasing a wave of new hardware and software that he says will define Tesla's future.\n\n\"2026 will be something special,\" Musk posted on X on January 1.\n\nTesla's promises for the year fall into four major bets: self-driving software for consumer cars, a fully autonomous robotaxi service, humanoid robots, and showing off at least one long-delayed new vehicle.\n\nAnalysts say the company's future increasingly hinges on just one thing — whether its AI-powered autonomy can work at scale.\n\n\"I think 2026 is going to be the prove-it year for Tesla's robotaxi business,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely watches Tesla, told Business Insider. \"That's ultimately going to be the major driver for Tesla this year.\"\n\nLast June, Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s started carting passengers around Austin, Texas with no humans behind the steering wheel. Instead, the company launched with so-called \"safety drivers\" in the front passenger seat to intervene if needed.\n\nGoldstein said he's watching closely to see where regulators allow Tesla's self-driving vehicles to operate — and whether the company becomes confident enough in its technology to remove safety drivers from the front seats entirely.\n\nRight now, the robotaxis are driving in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\n\nDuring the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla's purpose-built autonomous vehicle, known as the Cybercab, would begin volume production in April. The two-passenger vehicle is designed without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\n\"That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy,\" he said on the call. \"I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\"\n\nTesla has also claimed a significant lead over competitors in consumer self-driving data. During the same earnings call, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of Autopilot and AI software, said customers had driven more than six billion miles using Full Self-Driving in supervised mode.\n\n\"That's a big milestone,\" Elluswamy said. \"Overall, the safety continues to be very good.\"\n\nThose claims come as both legacy automakers and tech companies push deeper into autonomous driving. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled its new self-driving car platform. Rivian said its $45,000 R2 SUV, launching in early 2026, will include self-driving capabilities. Ford plans to roll out advanced autonomous tech on its 2027 electric pickup, while General Motors is offering point-to-point hands-free driving in its high-end Cadillac Escalade IQ.\n\nMusk has dismissed the competition. In a post on X, he said Tesla was five years ahead of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — in self-driving technology.\n\nTesla is also preparing to reintroduce the second-generation Roadster, a two-door electric sports car first unveiled more than 8 years ago that has been repeatedly delayed. The vehicle is now slated for another unveiling on April Fool's Day.\n\nIn November, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that if Peter Thiel wanted a future with flying cars, he should get it. Musk has said the new Roadster is a collaboration with SpaceX and will include rocket technology.\n\n\"It's going to be the most memorable product unveil ever,\" he said, before telling the notorious podcaster that he set the unveil date for April Fools for \"deniability.\"\n\nThe Semi, an electric eighteen-wheeler, is also expected to roll out of Tesla's Nevada factory in the first half of 2026.\n\nEarly production models traversed California's highways with Pepsi and Walmart products in pilot tests.\n\nThen there's Optimus — a major bet for Tesla and one that Musk has said will be \"the biggest product ever.\"\n\nMusk has said the humanoid robots will eventually handle general-purpose tasks like folding laundry, tightening screws, or stirring a pot of pasta.\n\nBut manufacturing Optimus has proved challenging. Musk has said designing its hands, for example, is \"an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.\"\n\nIn a 2024 post on X, he claimed Tesla was aiming for \"high production for other companies\" by 2026, suggesting the robots could one day be manufactured at scale for outside customers.\n\nMusk's recent track record for deadlines has given some investors reason to be cautious of the CEO's projections for the coming year.\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed optimist when it comes to deadlines and goals, but he does have a history of delivering much of what he promises — eventually.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary,\" Goldstein told Business Insider. \"He's figured out a lot of very difficult problems in the past when other people couldn't — making profitable EVs and reusable rockets — he deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nBut Goldstein said Tesla's path to automotive dominance is narrowing. As the company has focused heavily on autonomy, other automakers have improved vehicle hardware quickly enough to challenge Tesla's advantage.\n\nThat's particularly true in China, he said.\n\n\"BYD has surpassed Tesla and then gone after a lower price point in key markets in China and Europe,\" he said.\n\nTesla has reported two consecutive years of sales declines, Goldstein added, and \"it's looking like 2026 could be a third.\" Meanwhile, many US automakers are pulling back from EVs and car-buyers can no longer enjoy the $7,500 EV incentive.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a bit of a challenge for Tesla as the EV scene has since dramatically changed, especially with last year's disappearance of any helpful federal tax credits,\" Robby DeGraff, a product and consumer insights manager at AutoPacific, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Subtle, slight refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 plus reveals of the Cybercab and other innovations like the humanoid robots were newsworthy sure, but the reality is Tesla's lineup is stale and lagging behind much of the competition in terms of design, performance, and features,\" he added.\n\nDespite those risks, many investors remain sold on Musk's vision.\n\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares hit a record high of more than $481. The stock is up about 12% over the last year, including a roughly 50% surge in the past six months.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for Tesla to do right now, especially as we see the EV market slow a bit, is ready and ensure there's a proper entry-level, affordable EV out there for consumers,\" DeGraff added.\n\nDeGraff said the new \"Standard\" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y are \"a good step\" but \"there's more work to be done to bring that pricing down, which still remains a major deterrent for uncertain EV shoppers.\"",

    "description": "David Moss, a Tesla owner since 2024, said he traveled 11,000 miles across the US with Full Self-Driving. He said FSD is indispensable.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Moss, 28, a resident of Puyallup, Washington, who has been documenting his experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Moss told Business Insider that he does not own Tesla stock.\n\nBusiness Insider verified Moss's travel logs, charging stops, and FSD mileage data that is displayed on his car. Tesla only displays FSD usage down to the 10th of a mile.\n\nI've owned a Tesla since March 2024.\n\nTesla's Full Self-Driving feature was the primary reason I made the purchase. I would say the electric aspect is almost an inconvenience, and FSD is my main interest in the Tesla.\n\nCharging around my hometown isn't a pain. There's a station near my house, and I have a charger at home.\n\nHowever, my commutes are long. I'm a product manager for a company that makes 3D lidar scanners, and a lot of my job is visiting clients on-site all around America.\n\nI drive over 50,000 miles a year. Given the number of miles I drive, an electric car is a slower form of transportation than a gas car.\n\nMy first Tesla was a Cybertruck, but unfortunately, I totaled it in August while I was driving it in off-road mode. In September, I bought the long-range Model 3. The company was running a promotion where if you bought a Model 3 before the tax credit expired, you got a free year of charging.\n\nSince then, I've put over 23,000 miles on the car. So I've been making good use of the free electricity.\n\nI began a road trip on October 28 and have since driven 18,741 miles.\n\nAround November 25, while I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, I got the FSD version 14.2 update and have driven over 11,000 miles without any intervention as of December 31.\n\nWhen I say no intervention, I mean down to the 10th of a mile — 100% no steering wheel or pedal touches. That includes parking and getting into a charging station.\n\nFSD navigated restaurants, supercharger stations, office complexes — every single part of the drive.\n\nDuring the trip, I've gone down several dirt roads and construction zones that had cones, reroutes, and road closures. One morning, I was in Reno, leaving my hotel, and the normal road was closed for construction. The car immediately turned around and found an alternative route.\n\nOne of the more interesting cases was in Wyoming during a severe windstorm.\n\nThere were alerts, warning of 80 mph winds. In about a hundred-mile stretch, I saw six different tipped-over semi-trucks.\n\nI was a little nervous about driving on the freeway with high-wind caution alerts, but FSD handled everything while I was on Interstate 80, traveling from Cheyenne to Evanston. FSD drove without even touching a lane marker once.\n\nI think in that situation, FSD shone more than usual.\n\nSince Raleigh, I've traveled across the country — down to Miami, across Texas, through the Rockies, and up to Medford, Oregon.\n\nAfter a two-day pit stop back in my hometown in Washington for Christmas Eve, I headed to Los Angeles and drove across the US until I hit South Carolina.\n\nI put on a lot of audiobooks and podcasts while FSD drives. I also took business calls or calls with friends and family.\n\nI haven't tested out being on my phone with my eyes off the road. That's still against the law, and it's just not worth the risk.\n\nI've never dozed off during the drive, but I'm also not constantly on the edge of my seat or grimacing while FSD is on.\n\nI'm a million times less scared than I've ever been in an Uber ride or with most of my friends. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the most pleasant driving I've experienced.\n\nWhen I started my road trip on October 28, my Tesla was on FSD version 13.2.9.\n\nEventually, when I was in the southern part of Alberta in Canada, I installed version 14.1. That was around the evening of November 5. Around November 25, I got 14.2.\n\nI have a Starlink Mini mounted underneath my Tesla's glass roof, allowing me to download updates remotely and install them while I sleep in my hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't call the difference between 14.1 and 14.2 a grand night-and-day difference, but there's definitely been a noticeable improvement under version 14: the ability to park, more speed profiles like \"Sloth\" and \"Mad Max\" mode, and just the overall smoothness.\n\nFor the first time, with 14.2, I was able to win people over when I showed FSD to my friends and family. Before they were like, \"Oh, that's kind of cool,\" \"It's a gimmick,\" or \"I'm not going to buy this.\" Now, they're saying, \"Oh wow, I actually need that.\"\n\nI can't speak enough about how much I love FSD and how much it inconveniences me to drive.\n\nA lot of the driving I currently do is simply because I don't want to fly. Because I know that when I arrive at the airport, I'm likely not going to be able to rent a car with FSD.\n\nThe record-setting was never really the focus.\n\nI didn't even check the FSD stat page for several hundred miles before I started seeing people post about it online, saying, \"Oh wow, I've actually not touched the wheel at all.\"\n\nAt this point, a technology like FSD is indispensable to having a car. The feature provides me with peace of mind, having that \"extra set of eyes\" on the road.\n\nThere's also a personal side to that because my father is legally blind and can't operate a vehicle. If there were one day an unsupervised Cybercab that he could buy, we'd buy it on day one.\n\nMy father's ecstatic. He believes he's one day closer to gaining his independence.",

    "title": "EVs stumbled into 2026. Now automakers are betting on cheaper cars.",
    "description": "Tesla and legacy automakers are shifting to budget-friendly EVs amid sales declines, subsidy cuts, and mounting US consumer auto debt concerns.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, the electric-vehicle industry looks like it's heading into 2026 with a flat tire.\n\nFederal subsidies are gone, and EV sales have cooled since September. Even Tesla, America's dominant EV maker, is experiencing a sales slowdown.\n\nNow, carmakers are scrapping once-ambitious EV plans.\n\nIn December, Ford discontinued production of the all-electric F-150 and announced a $19.4 billion write-down tied to its battery investments. A week later, Volkswagen halted production of the electric ID. Buzz minivan for 2026, with plans to potentially revive it in 2027.\n\nThat trend snowballed on Thursday. General Motors said it expects to lose $6 billion as it retools its EV strategy. On the same day, Stellantis went even further, discontinuing every plug-in hybrid in its lineup — including the once-bestselling Jeep Wrangler 4xe.\n\nBut beneath the headline-grabbing cancellations, there's a quieter shift underway that could end up reviving the ailing EV market. It has everything to do with the auto industry's biggest problem: price.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable as more mainstream options enter the market,\" Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told Business Insider. \"We're finally seeing automakers deliver EVs at price points beyond the luxury segment.\"\n\nThis year, legacy automakers — including several that recently pulled back EV projects — are preparing their factory floors to churn out lower-cost electric cars. Startups are jumping into the fray, too.\n\nNissan's Leaf just rebooted as a $29,000 Tesla Model Y look-alike. Subaru and Toyota are launching the Uncharted and C-HR — nearly identical crossover SUVs with $35,000 starting prices. Kia will have a $35,000 competitor with the EV3. Rivian is about to release its $45,000 R2 onto American roads. The Jeff Bezos-backed Slate anticipates its mid-$20,000 pickup will launch in the fall. Chevy's Bolt is returning with $29,000 on the sticker.\n\nThe push toward cheaper EVs is expected to roll into 2027, too, with Ford launching its $30,000 electric pickup.\n\nIt all comes as Americans struggle to keep up with every-expanding vehicle debt.\n\nThe average price of a new vehicle sold in the US hit $50,077 this week, Automotive News reported, citing Cloud Theory's average marketed price metric. That sticker shock has pushed the median buyer to put $6,579 down and take on monthly payments of $748 stretched across nearly six years, NerdWallet data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans carried a record $1.66 trillion in auto loan debt in 2024, the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's more than credit cards and federal student loans, and second only to mortgages. Delinquencies also crept higher that year, a sign that many consumers ran out of room to absorb ever-larger car payments.\n\n\"The reality was that new vehicle sales were being driven by well-heeled consumers,\" Keating said — a dynamic that was especially pronounced in the EV market.\n\nSince 2020, when legacy automakers started launching their first EVs to compete with Tesla, they focused heavily on top-end cars with luxury prices.\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning, for example, started around $50,000. Higher-end trims climbed into the high-$90,000 range. Rivian's R1S SUV started at $77,000. Lucid's Air sedan cost between $70,000 and $250,000.\n\nIn September, the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped modestly bring down those high prices largely expired.\n\nNow, as those same carmakers roll out lower-priced models, the industry appears to be course correcting, Keating said. Much of the early EV premium reflected the cost of building an entirely new ecosystem, she added.\n\nEarly buyers weren't just paying for a car. They were helping automakers finance new battery plants, retool factories, retrain workers, and pour billions into supply chains that didn't yet exist.\n\nSix years later, much of that infrastructure is already in place. As a result, new EV consumers are beginning to see those sunk costs roll off the sticker price.\n\nNow, automakers are going to see how much consumers actually want competitive EV products.\n\n\"We're entering a period where we'll see what organic demand for EVs actually looks like, without the policy thumb on the scale,\" Keating said. \"They're not going to abandon EV platforms. They've already made the investments.\"",

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, once said the \"hard part\" of getting rich is pulling together the first $100,000, as that's often a \"long struggle\" for someone starting at zero.\n\nElon Musk is at the polar opposite end of the wealth spectrum — worth so much on paper that he can gain or lose tens of billions of dollars and barely move the needle on his net worth.\n\nAfter just two trading days this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has added $24 billion to his personal fortune, lifting it by about 4% to $644 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe world's richest person by far — he's worth more than double Alphabet cofounder Larry Page in second place — was last year's biggest wealth gainer with a $187 billion increase.\n\nMusk is comfortably leading that list in 2026 as well. As of Monday's close, Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy is a distant runner up with a roughly $8 billion gain.\n\nIt's not exactly clear why Musk's fortune has swelled this year. Tesla stock has only inched up 0.4%, boosting the value of its CEO's stake by less than $2 billion even if his previously disputed stock options are included.\n\nSpaceX's valuation rocketed to $800 billion in December, but that was reflected in Musk's wealth gain last year. Nor have there been any publicized valuation increases for his other companies, which include xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\n\nThat suggests Bloomberg has simply tweaked its calculations, causing a change in net worth that would be material even for Musk's fellow centibillionaires, but appears closer to a rounding error for Musk.\n\nTech billionaires like Musk have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as investors continue to bet big that their companies will capitalize on the red-hot trend.\n\nPage and his cofounder, Sergey Brin, have both added over $2 billion to their fortunes this year, thanks to Alphabet shares climbing 1% or so.

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

    "description": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever, and one \"Big Short\" trader says it's the most overvalued stock in the market.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever.\n\nIt's up nearly double since bottoming out last April. And those gains are happening at a time when sales are declining. Tesla isn't even the world's biggest EV-maker anymore.\n\nThe situation spotlights the growing disconnect between the company's valuation in the stock market and its ability to keep dominating the sale of EVs.\n\nBulls will shrug off those concerns and say the company's AI efforts will eventually provide the earnings juice to normalize those valuations. Bears, on the other hand, are not so forgiving.\n\nPorter Collins — the former FrontPoint Partners trader who was immortalized in \"The Big Short\" for his bet against the US housing market — fits firmly into latter camp.\n\nHe told Business Insider recently that he sees Tesla as the market's most overvalued stock.\n\n\"I think that the most obvious one in all of the S&P is Tesla,\" he said. \"I think that's the poster child of the asset class.\"\n\nHe said that while fellow Big Tech leader Nvidia trades at roughly 45 times next year's earnings forecast, Tesla currently trades at almost 300 times the 2026 projection.\n\nCollins thinks that Tesla should be valued in line with other automakers, or other Big Tech firms. He argues that it's presently in a world of its own, not being valued on the fundamentals of any specific sector.\n\n\"I honestly think Tesla is just a meme stock,\" he stated. \"People follow Elon Musk and they think he will produce generational type products in the future. He may or may not, but that's the bet right now.\"\n\nCollins doesn't necessarily consider that a bad thing. But he does think it clouds investors' ability to properly assess it.\n\n\"Meme stocks have tended to be high flyers,\" he admitted. \"Some meme stocks have come back to Earth, but others have not. GameStop and AMC eventually came back to economic reality. Tesla? We'll see.\"\n\nCollins isn't the only \"Big Short\" alumnus who feels this way about Tesla. Michael Burry has recently criticized the company's lofty valuation on his Substack, although — like Collins — he has stopped short of actually shorting the stock.",

    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "fullText": "Chinese auto giant BYD on Friday dethroned U.S. rival Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles on a calendar-year basis.\n\nThe milestone caps an extraordinary rise for BYD, a company Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed by laughing at their products during a 2011 Bloomberg interview.\n\nIn a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.\n\nMusk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tesla ended a roller coaster year with its sales going into reverse.\n\nElon Musk's automaker said on Friday that it sold 418,227 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, down by 15.6% from the same period in 2024.\n\nIt means Tesla's annual sales have declined for the second consecutive year, and that Chinese rival BYD has surpassed Tesla for the first time in annual sales of battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to sell around 441,000 EVs, per data compiled by Bloomberg, while Tesla released its own, more pessimistic, analyst consensus forecast of 422,850 units in an unusual move earlier this week.\n\nBYD said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units in 2025. Tesla said it delivered about 1.64 million vehicles for the year.\n\nTesla recorded its first-ever annual sales decline in 2024, after years of explosive growth. The latest figures suggest the company has been hit hard by the demise of the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September.\n\nThe looming deadline saw US buyers race to snap up electric vehicles, driving record sales for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOnce the tax credit ended, however, EV sales dropped across the board, including at Tesla's rivals Ford, Hyundai, and Kia.\n\nThe slump saw Tesla's sales hit their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the brand rolling out cheaper versions of its bestselling Model 3 and Y vehicles a month before.\n\nTesla has also faced difficulties this year in Europe and China, two of its biggest international markets.\n\nIn China, the EV giant has faced fierce competition from local rivals offering high-tech electric models at rock-bottom prices.\n\nTesla's sales have plummeted in Europe amid backlash over CEO Musk's endorsement of far-right German party AfD, with December registrations dropping 66% year-over-year in France and 44% in Spain, according to national auto association data.\n\nAnalysts previously told Business Insider that Tesla is also suffering from a stale product lineup. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and the divisive pickup has been a sales disappointment.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Tesla's stock price hit a record high in December as investors expressed optimism over the automaker's robotaxi rollout.\n\nTesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June and has ambitious plans to expand autonomous ride-hailing to multiple cities in the US this year.\n\nMusk has said the company's future lies in its robotaxi and Optimus robot initiatives, and the Austin-based automaker is preparing to begin mass production in April of its Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nIn an earnings call in October, Musk said that the looming launch of Tesla's \"unsupervised\" Full Self-Driving software would boost demand for the company's vehicles, and told investors that the robotaxi service in Austin would operate without safety monitors by the end of 2025.\n\nMusk said on December 24 that he took a ride around Austin without a safety driver, but as of Wednesday, they were still sitting inside vehicles available to the public.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Elon Musk made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi could achieve in 2025, including fully-autonomous driving",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi would achieve by the end of 2025: fully autonomous rides for the public; expanded service areas in multiple regions; and coverage for half the US population, among other milestones.\n\nWith the year closing, here's what Tesla's ride-hailing service looks like.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 30 Teslas were operating in Austin, where the pilot launch began, offering paid rides with a safety monitor in the front passenger seat.\n\nTesla also deployed a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area earlier this year. There, a safety monitor sits behind the steering wheel due to California regulations.\n\nMusk missing deadlines is hardly new. It's called \"Elon Time.\" There's a website for it. Even the CEO himself recognizes it.\n\n\"I am pathologically optimistic with time,\" he said in May 2024. \"Have been ever since I was a kid.\"\n\nTesla investors and analysts have learned to accept this Musk quirk — just as long as the CEO delivers.\n\n\"I hear Tesla lay out the vision, then I try to listen to what the markers are to get there,\" Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst, previously told Business Insider.\n\nDays before the year ends, Tesla employees have shared videos on X of what appear to be fully autonomous rides in Austin with no in-car safety monitor. Musk said he took a ride as well and noted \"perfect driving.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here's everything Musk said Tesla Robotaxi would achieve in 2025.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere's one that was quickly debunked.\n\nDuring an earnings call in April, Musk teased the launch of Tesla Robotaxi and said the company was \"on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June,\" following \"many other cities in the US by the end of this year.\"\n\nThat didn't happen. Tesla Robotaxi was launched with safety monitors in the front passenger seat of the Model Ys.\n\nThe monitors are there to stop the rides if they detect unwanted driving behavior, Business Insider reported after using Tesla Robotaxi in Austin.\n\nIn October, Musk said that he expects Robotaxi to be in about \"eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year,\" including Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, pending regulatory approval.\n\nTesla received permits to operate a ride-hailing service in the three states mentioned. The company also appears to be hiring for Robotaxi-related jobs across the US.\n\nHowever, as of Wednesday, the only paid service available to the public is limited to the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin.\n\nMusk told the All-In podcast also in October that Tesla will \"probably\" have \"a thousand cars or \n\nSo far, there's little evidence to suggest that Tesla is operating with that many vehicles in either region.\n\nThe Robotaxi Tracker, which tracks fleet size through crowdsourced data, shows that there are roughly 35 vehicles in Austin and around 130 vehicles in the Bay Area.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported this month that Tesla registered 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers for its ride-hailing service.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said Tesla will likely have robotaxis operating for \"half of the population of the US by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe caveats were that the goal is subject to regulatory approval and that the company wants to be \"very, very cautious.\"\n\nMusk said in Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October that the company expects to remove the safety drivers in \"large parts of Austin\" by the end of 2025.\n\nA safety monitor still sits inside Tesla Robotaxi as of Wednesday, but it appears the company is making progress toward that goal.\n\n\"A Tesla with no safety monitor in the car and me sitting in the passenger seat took me all around Austin on Sunday with perfect driving,\" Musk said in an X post on December 24.\n\nThis is separate from Robotaxi, but FSD, or Full Self-Driving, is the key technology that will underpin Tesla's autonomous ride-hailing service.\n\nIn April, Musk said Tesla would deliver FSD Unsupervised for personally-owned vehicles by the end of the year in \"many cities in the US.\"\n\nCurrently, drivers are required to pay attention to the roads to keep FSD activated.\n\nMusk said earlier this month that a software update allowed drivers to use their phones in certain traffic conditions.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistar Barr tried it. Police don't recommend it.",

    "fullText": "Tesla endured tough year in part thanks to some consumers’ distaste for Elon Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics\n\nTesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years’ sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nThe US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new “consensus” section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.\n\nThe estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.\n\nMusk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.\n\nTesla’s shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan’s Toyota. Musk’s Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made him by far the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, much of Tesla’s valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.\n\nWhen it comes to actual sales, Tesla has endured a tough year in part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics.\n\nIn 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US president did not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.\n\nThe estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.\n\nThe forecasts for later years are also far below Musk’s stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.\n\nTesla shareholders in November approved a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.",

He replied that he isn't short.\n\nThe question was timely, given the EV-maker this week took the unusual move of releasing sales forecasts that are weaker than many expected.\n\nBurry's answer might come as a surprise to some, considering the investor took to his Substack on Tuesday to criticize Tesla.\n\n\"Tesla sales falling. It is a ridiculously overvalued stock,\" he wrote.\n\nBut he then added a cautionary note about how risky it is to short.\n\n\"Shorting it has been dangerous, and the puts are expensive. So maybe not much to do here for most people, except sell it if they can,\" he said.\"\n\nDespite his reluctance to short now, Burry has bet against Tesla stock previously.

He added that he would need to see earnings growth not go negative but decelerate in order for him to feel comfortable shorting these companies.\n\nPorter Collins, one of Moses' partners, revealed that he sees Tesla stock as highly overpriced, noting that he considers it to simply be a meme stock driven primarily by retail speculation and adoration for Musk.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "Tesla had a surprise Christmas present for investors this year: more bad news about its EV business.\n\nElon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.\n\nThe delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.\n\nThat's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.\n\nTesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,\" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.\n\nBlack wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.\n\nTesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.\n\nTesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.\n\nThe company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.\n\nThings haven't gone much better outside the US. Tesla has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.\n\nThe slump has left Tesla facing a race against time to avoid its second consecutive annual sales decline.\n\nTesla has rolled out a range of incentives in the US and is pushing to introduce its Full Self-Driving tech in China and Europe, but the surprise delivery consensus estimated that Tesla will end the year having sold over 100,000 fewer EVs than in 2024.",

    "description": "In four years, this humble EV saved its owners tens of thousands in fuel costs.",
    "fullText": "The Tesla Model 3 is one of the most popular electric cars in the world.\n\nIt’s particularly popular among big city taxi drivers.\n\nThis rear-wheel drive Model 3 Long Range used to be a taxi, and in just four years, it has racked up no fewer than 238,000 miles.\n\nA recent Consumer Reports study found that used Tesla EVs are at the bottom of the list when it comes to reliability, but there’s some nuance there, and it’s important. CR said that cars made between 2016 and 2021 are the worst offenders, as Tesla was trying to ramp up production any way it could, including using assembly tents.\n\nStarting in 2021, things improved significantly, and it’s clear as day when looking at the blue Model 3 showcased in the RSymons video embedded below. This humble 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range had a rough life as a taxi in the United Kingdom, and it racked up an impressive number of miles in just four years: 238,000, to be precise.\n\nAfter so much abuse, any car would have some faults pop up, and this Tesla is no different. But the severity and costs to repair all the issues are undoubtedly much lower than on a comparable gas-powered car.\n\nFirst things first, the ex-taxi Tesla still has its original high-voltage battery, original rear electric motor, original brakes, original bodywork and original windows. That’s mighty impressive, but it gets better still. Except for the steering wheel, which has seen better days and should probably be replaced sooner rather than later, the interior is in great shape after so many miles and passenger rides. The same goes for the bodywork.\n\nGetting back to the big battery, it’s still going strong, with a reported 85.5% state of health, which practically means the car can achieve 85.5% of the range it had on its first day.\n\nThat’s all good news, but the repairs and maintenance costs are where things get interesting. So far, this Tesla Model 3 Long Range has never broken down, and most of the money was spent on normal maintenance items. It’s now on its seventh set of tires, which seems a bit daunting.\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nIt had several bushes replaced, including the rear motor mounts, and the pedestrian warning sound speaker failed at 232,000 miles. In total, the car’s two owners have spent the equivalent of $7,566 (£5,603), including tires, wiper blades, cabin air filters, suspension components and labor.\n\nThat’s not really impressive, but the car makes up for the maintenance costs by saving money on fuel. In total, this Model 3 used 92.6 megawatt-hours of energy, with 28.2 MWh coming from regenerative braking alone. The car used 64,422 kilowatt-hours of payable electricity, and with the average price of $0.17/kWh in the United States, it means that it cost the equivalent of $10,951 to recharge. That’s $2,738 per year or $0.04/mile.\n\nThe fact that the Tesla Model 3 is very efficient helps a lot, with this particular car averaging an impressive 4.2 miles/kWh since February. But there you have it. You might not love Tesla as a brand–or its outspoken CEO–but there’s no denying that the cars it makes are hard to beat.\n\nUsed Tesla EVs Are A Bargain. Reliability Isn't Their Strong Suit\n\n'Absolutely Relentless': What Tesla Had To Learn From Tearing Down Chinese EVs\n\nTesla May Add CarPlay.

    "description": "Tesla sales in Europe have plunged to a three-year low, part of a wider decline. However, its stock remains well-positioned—for now.",
    "fullText": "According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) November report on EU car registrations, the figure for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) decreased 34.2% to 12,130. For the first 11 months of the year, they were down 38.8% to 129,024. The declines are part of a larger problem that runs from China to the United States. It also shows the extent to which the company’s strong stock performance this year is based on founder and CEO Elon Musk insisting that Tesla is not a car company but an artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicle, and robotics company.\n\nTesla’s U.S. sales dropped 23% to a three-year low of 39,800 in November, Reuters reports. Sales in China, the world’s largest EV market by far, also signaled trouble. According to Barron’s, “In November, the electric-vehicle maker sold just over 73,000 cars in China, down almost 1% year over year, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung.”\n\nTesla’s problem in the European Union is worse than it first seems. Registrations for BYD vehicles were up 235.2% to 16,158. For the year, the figure increased by 240% to 110,715. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is Tesla’s biggest rival. The Chinese company has charged into countries outside its home market.\n\nTesla’s stock has shaken off the bad news about car sales. It is up 20% this year to about $485. What is more impressive is that its shares traded at $217 in March. This was primarily due to Musk’s involvement with President Trump’s effort to downsize the U.S. government, which eventually led to a falling out between the two. Tesla is the world’s eighth most valuable company, with a market cap of $1.61 trillion.\n\nTesla has begun testing its self-driving robotaxi in Austin and aims to roll out tests in Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. However, it needs to contend with other operators in the same space, led by Alphabet’s Waymo. Legacy car manufacturers, including Ford and GM, are also launching products of their own.\n\nTesla’s robotics claim is impossible to evaluate. Its humanoid robot, Optimus, has not had an impressive debut.\n\nIf investors ever return to viewing Tesla as a car company, the stock is in trouble.\n\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030",

    "description": "The Cybertruck has been on sale in the US for nearly two years, but Tesla has shown no signs of brining its most divisive EV across the Atlantic.",
    "fullText": "Tesla fans in Europe are still waiting for the company's most divisive product.\n\nThe Cybertruck has been on sale in the US for nearly two years, becoming both a status car and a target for anti-Elon Musk protests, but Tesla has shown no sign of bringing it across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel frame and razor-sharp edges fall foul of a bunch of European regulations, and efforts to import the truck into Europe have sparked political backlash and led to Cybertrucks being seized by police.\n\nRaven Seeholzer is trying to change that.\n\nThe founder of used Tesla marketplace Teslab and his team have spent the past year tearing apart a fleet of Cybertrucks in their workshop in Basel, Switzerland, and Seeholzer now believes they are tantalizingly close to making the \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup road-legal in the country.\n\n\"We're in the final stage of getting it road legal here. We just wanted to bring this crazy car to European roads and show everybody that it's safe,\" he told Business Insider in an interview in October.\n\nSeeholzer has run Teslab since 2018, but his quest to bring the Cybertruck to Switzerland began last year, after he realized it would likely take Tesla years to navigate the regulatory and logistical hurdles to start building Cybertrucks in Europe.\n\nOther attempts to bring the truck across the Atlantic have largely ended in failure. One custom-wrapped vehicle was seized by police in the UK in January after they concluded it was not road-legal in the country.\n\nAnother imported to the UK by YouTuber and luxury car dealer Yianni Charalambous quickly became embroiled in a spate of issues, with local politicians calling for the vehicle to be seized by police.\n\nCharalambous, who had intended to modify the pickup to make it road-legal in the UK, later said he planned to leave the UK and take his Cybertruck with him.\n\nLast year, a modified Cybertruck apparently registered in Czechia sparked criticism from campaigners and road safety advocates, who sent a letter to authorities calling for Cybertrucks to be banned from European roads.\n\nSeeholzer told Business Insider that many of the Cybertrucks imported into Europe so far had not been properly registered and had only minor modifications. Teslab, which has a fleet of five imported Cybertrucks in its Swiss workshop, has essentially rebuilt its prototype pickups from the ground up, he said.\n\nAccording to Seeholzer, the Cybertruck's famously sharp edges — which left some early owners with cuts — were the biggest issue.\n\nEuropean regulations do not allow vehicles with sharp edges that could harm pedestrians, so Teslab had to cover them with rubber and build a new front bumper to improve the vehicle's crash protection.\n\nTeslab's team of engineers also had to overhaul the Cybertruck's electrical wiring to make it compatible with European regulations, a process Seeholzer said involved essentially \"re-engineering\" the pickup.\n\n\"The car was pretty much fully apart,\" he said.\n\nSince then, the modified Cybertruck has undergone a grueling regime of government tests in Switzerland to be registered as road-legal.\n\nSeeholzer said the vehicle had passed most of the major hurdles to get approved, adding that it was a \"matter of time\" before Teslab's first Cybertruck was registered in the country.\n\nThe rest of Europe may have to wait, however — Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, and Seeholzer admitted that getting approval in the EU would be a lengthy process.\n\nDespite Europe's cautious approach to the Cybertruck, the demand seems to be there. Seeholzer said that Teslab had already sold three of its five Cybertrucks and had received around 400 preorders as of October.\n\nHe added that weight regulations meant that the first few European Cybertruck owners would have to treat their trucks as a \"lifestyle\" vehicle and avoid traditional truck activities.\n\n\"In Switzerland, the maximum weight for a car is three and a half thousand kilograms. The [modified] Cybertruck is a bit under it, which means you cannot load too much,\" he said.\n\nWeighing in at 3.5 tons, the pickup will be a tight squeeze on European roads, which are often far narrower than in the US. Its sharp edges and 0-60mph time of 2.6 seconds have also led some experts to compare it to a guided missile on wheels.\n\nBruno Dvorský thinks otherwise. The cofounder of Cybertruck.cz, the company behind the Cybertruck, registered in Czechia last year, told Business Insider in October he had imported another Cybertruck into the country and planned to register it before crashing it earlier this year.\n\nDvorský said Cybertruck.cz had added silicone coverings to blunt the Cybertruck's sharp edges, swapped out its red lights for yellow ones that comply with local rules, and added reversing lights.\n\nHe argued that the Cybertruck is no less dangerous than other large pickups already available in Europe, and said detractors were \"bicycle riders\" who lived \"small\" lives and were jealous of the vehicle.\n\n\"It's okay, but don't hate on other things,\" said Dvorský.\n\nIn September, the US Army Customs Agency said that Germany had denied requests for service members to bring their Cybertrucks into the country because the vehicle \"deviates significantly\" from EU regulations.\n\nThe agency said the Cybertruck violated European rules banning vehicles from having sharp edges and requiring speed limiters on anything weighing over 3.5 tons.\n\nIn 2020, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would likely eventually build a smaller version of the pickup for global markets like Europe and China. There's been no sign that Tesla has any plans to do this, and the brand's sales have cratered in Europe this year amid backlash against Musk.\n\n\"When anyone looks at the facts and the applicable rules, it's clear the Cybertruck is illegal in Europe,\" James Nix, a policy manager at European think-tank Transport & Environment, which was among the signatories of the letter protesting the Czech Cybertruck, told Business Insider in October.\n\nNix said that he expects further attempts to put Cybertrucks on European roads to be \"discontinued\" in the wake of Germany's decision, adding that it would likely be impossible for anyone who imported a Cybertruck into Europe to get the necessary insurance.\n\nWould-be European Cybertruck owners do have one unlikely ally: the Trump administration. After the US president imposed a barrage of tariffs on the EU earlier this year, the two superpowers unveiled a framework for a trade deal in August that included a commitment to standardize vehicle regulations.\n\nIn October, a group of European cities, non-profits, and safety campaigners sent a letter to European regulators urging them not to accept US standards, warning that it could lead to Cybertruck-style vehicles on European roads.\n\nSeeholzer said he hoped Teslab's plan to make the Cybertruck road-legal in Europe would change the perception of Tesla's most controversial EV.\n\nHe added that previous efforts to get the Cybertruck into Europe, some of which have used unmodified imported vehicles, have done more harm than good.\n\n\"Nobody tried to really do something to change the car. They just did maybe things on the edges, maybe changed a few things on the lights, but nobody went all in,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is resorting to one of the oldest tricks in the book, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to boost demand for Cybertrucks.\n\nElectrek reported on how Musk is using one of his companies, SpaceX, to help make up for a massive shortfall of a market for the controversial Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is facing challenges selling even 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, far below Musk's initial projections of 500,000, per Electrek's analysis. As a result, Tesla is left with large stockpiles of the vehicles even as they've heavily reduced their production.\n\nMaking a small dent in the inventory is SpaceX. The company has already bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks with room to double its fleet. An X user shared a video of a lot teeming with the vehicles.\n\nAt a starting retail price of $80,000, SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.\n\nAs Electrek pointed out, there is nothing illegal about Musk's machinations here. Still, essentially having to bail out a failing product isn't good news for Tesla nor the best move for SpaceX.\n\nInvestors certainly should be concerned that Musk's moves here are self-serving. There's also the matter of SpaceX receiving large help from the government, and then turning around and buying Cybertrucks.\n\n\"In other words, government subsidies that were meant to get us back to the moon are being used to buy unsellable trucks that look like big dumpsters,\" a frustrated commenter on Electrek opined.\n\nMusk's struggles in moving Cybertrucks provide another example of overpromising and underdelivering. Before it was released, the vehicle had over one million reservations. Only a mere 60,000 of those were converted into sales.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectrek chalked up that failure to consumers picking up on a bait-and-switch from Tesla after unveiling their 2019 prototype. The actual Cybertruck is more expensive, has less range, and boasts fewer attractive features.",

    "description": "\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\"",
    "fullText": "A passerby noticed an unexpected passenger peering out the window of a parked Tesla — a puppy. While such a sight is often worrying, a unique Tesla feature put their mind at ease.\n\n\"Spotted the cutest floof,\" a Facebook user shared in a Dogspotting group. The Tesla's touchscreen reads, \"My driver will be back soon,\" and displays the internal temperature of the electric vehicle as 22 degrees Celsius (around 72 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile leaving a pet in a car may not seem dangerous, temperatures can heat up quickly, particularly on a hot day. Analysis from Total.vet found that the majority of heat-related pet deaths occurred when the animal's owners left them trapped inside hot vehicles.\n\nBecause of this, California and other states have laws allowing rescues under certain conditions. However, this can lead to unnecessarily broken glass if a vehicle is running remotely, leaving the pet in a safe and comfortable environment.\n\nTesla's \"Dog Mode\" ingeniously eliminates the potential for misunderstanding. Other Facebook users were impressed by the adorable display.\n\n\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\" one commenter shared.\n\n\"That Tesla feature omg. I hate them but I'd buy it specifically for my dogs,\" another said.\n\nAs evidenced by the fact that this Facebook post is a couple of years old, Tesla has been a polarizing brand for years. Anti-EV sentiment fueled by misinformation has played a role, while CEO Elon Musk's political activities and social media feuds have turned the company into a lightning rod for criticism in 2025, even contributing to a sales slump in key markets.\n\nMore broadly, though, demand for EVs remains robust.\n\nTesla itself even delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter as consumers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits in the U.S.\n\nEVs are shockingly cheaper to power up, particularly if you charge at home.\n\nIn fact, you could save hundreds of dollars per year. Qmerit offers instant, free installation estimates for Level 2 chargers.\n\nWould you rather have a Tesla or a Corvette?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nReady to maximize your savings associated with driving an EV? Try charging with your own energy rather than relying on the main grid. TCD's Solar Explorer can save you up to $10,000 on solar. EnergySage, one of TCD's Solar Explorer partners, makes it easy to obtain and compare competitive quotes from vetted installers.\n\nAnd whereas gas-powered cars spew toxic pollution responsible for millions of premature deaths every year — not to mention an overheating planet making things more dangerous for humans and pets alike — electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nIn the meantime, another Facebook user said they wanted to see a similar feature in other vehicles. Fortunately, multiple manufacturers have stepped up with their own versions of Dog Mode, giving many consumers yet another reason to make their next car an EV.\n\n\"Every car should have this option. So cool!\" the user exclaimed.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to bring more joy to the world.\n\nWriting on X on Christmas Eve, Musk said he was switching up Tesla's \"mission wording\" from \"Sustainable Abundance\" to \"Amazing Abundance.\"\n\n\"The latter is more joyful,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk appeared to be referring to Tesla's latest \"master plan,\" its long-term strategy document. The fourth edition, released this September, contains several mentions of \"sustainable abundance\" — an idea that Tesla's products and services will \"accelerate global prosperity\" and create \"a safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable world.\"\n\nAccording to Tesla's website, the EV company's actual mission statement is \"to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\nWhen Tesla's Master Plan Part IV was published earlier this year, the document was criticized for being lofty and vague. Musk appeared to concede the point, replying \"Fair enough. Will add specifics\" to a post on X from investing YouTuber Dave Lee in September.\n\nIt's unclear whether the \"amazing\" edit Musk teased will satisfy the critics, but the edit aligns with Tesla and Musk's future plans.\n\nMusk recently scored an amazing and abundant compensation package from Tesla worth up to $1 trillion if he can help the company deliver millions of cars, robots, and robotaxis, and increase the company's market value to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nMusk is known for playfully posting on X about his companies. The \"mission wording\" change is unlikely to signify a radical shift in direction for Tesla, though it could hint that the billionaire wants the brand's tone to be a little lighter.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment made outside normal business hours.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla and cofounded OpenAI. He wrote that vibe coding has produced a new type of code that is \"free\" and \"discardable.\"",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding\" earlier this year. Now, he has something to say about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla for five years, steering the company's Autopilot effort and briefly working on its humanoid robot Optimus. He sandwiched his Tesla job with two stints at OpenAI, making Karpathy a cofounder of the AI pioneer.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Karpathy published his year-in-review for large language models on X. He reflected on the famous term he originated in February, a term that has since shaken up the software engineering industry.\n\n\"With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals,\" Karpathy wrote. He called it an example of how \"regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments.\"\n\nVibe coding has likely benefited businesses, too. Tech companies have equipped their engineers with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex, aiming for productivity gains.\n\nKarpathy wrote that vibe coding \"empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written.\"\n\nIt may also change the makeup — or the use case — of the code itself. Karpathy threw out a slew of adjectives to describe this new body of code: It is \"free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use.\"\n\n\"Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions,\" he wrote.\n\nHow does Karpathy feel about being the term's origin?\n\n\"Amusingly, I coined the term \"vibe coding\" in this shower of thoughts tweet totally oblivious to how far it would go,\" he wrote.\n\nThere's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper…\n\nIt's not yet clear how efficient vibe coding is making engineers. In a METR study published in July, AI coding assistants were found to decrease the productivity of participating experienced software developers by 19%. The developers in that study were also overconfident in the tools, its authors said, expecting a 20% productivity boost even after using them.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the practice is unlocking a whole new form of tech products. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey vibe-coded a new messaging app this year. Non-technical workers are easily building, shipping, and, in some cases, even selling apps they build in hours, if not minutes.\n\nKarpathy gave some other reflections. He praised Google Gemini's Nano Banana image model, and wrote that Claude Code was the \"first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like.\"\n\nOverall, Karpathy wrote that 2025 was an \"exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz's electric CLA is priced $5,000 above the premium trim of the Tesla Model 3 — for an entirely different driving experience, BI found.",
    "fullText": "Calling a car, especially an EV, \"software-defined,\" when it's not a Tesla or Rivian can feel like a trap; it exposes a carmaker to some misleading or unhelpful comparisons.\n\nAt a media event with Mercedes-Benz earlier this month, I heard company representatives use the same phrase — \"software-defined vehicle\" or SDV — to describe the new CLA, Mercedes' entry-level EV, which starts at $47,250.\n\nThe CLA will be the launch platform for Mercedes' new MB.OS operating system, which will include an AI voice-assistant powered by both ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Drivers will interact with the new software interface through a screen that stretches across the entire dashboard. There are nearly 40 inches of display, including the driver's seat. It's a lot of screen.\n\nThere's also an advanced driver assistance system, which has become standard in modern vehicles. Mercedes plans to launch MB.DRIVE Assist PRO next year, which is supposed to share some of the ADAS functionalities as Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised.\n\nAs I heard Mercedes employees talk about the new CLA, I couldn't help think: Here's another legacy automaker now trying to play catch-up with major EV players.\n\nThat was before I got behind the wheel.\n\nI had the chance to drive the new CLA for about two hours around San Francisco. A week later, I demoed Tesla's premium trim of the Model 3, which is about $5,000 less than the entry-level CLA option.\n\nMercedes' new EV is no Tesla. Far from it. But, after my drive, I'd say it doesn't have to be.\n\nMy demo CLA didn't come equipped with Mercedes' MB.Drive Assist Pro, which is designed to be a Tesla FSD-level ADAS — essentially, supervised self-driving from the parking lot to the destination.\n\nStill, I was curious to try the Level 2 ADAS that came equipped in the car. A Mercedes spokesperson told me the latest update should provide a \"smoother overall driving experience with traffic light recognition and stopping.\"\n\nThe feature can be more comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, which provides steering assist, lane change assist, and recognizes traffic lights.\n\nIn a city like San Francisco, where there can be a lot of turning and stopping, relying on the ADAS felt a little tedious. I had to take over the wheel or press the brakes quite a bit to make a turn or wait for a pedestrian to cross.\n\nHowever, there was a crystal-clear moment in my drive when I realized my desire for an ADAS, which essentially drives for me, is secondary.\n\nPart of my test drive included traveling up O'Shaughnessy Boulevard, a long, winding road in San Francisco that leads to the Twin Peaks area.\n\nThe road in front of me was clear. I wasn't sure what was going on with the ADAS, whether it was on or \"suspended.\" So at one point, I disengaged the driver assist and pressed the pedal to see how it handled the curvy roads.\n\nReader — the CLA is a lot of fun to drive. Even in the busier city streets, the CLA's compact profile and torque from its electric powertrain made weaving past slower cars enjoyable — something an ADAS can't do, at least not yet.\n\nAnd that's a huge point that helped me overcome this mental reflex to compare the CLA to the Model 3.\n\nIn a Tesla, the driving experience can feel secondary to the technology.\n\nOutside the steering wheel, there's little else getting in between the driver and the large touchscreen, which is Tesla's goal.\n\nThe EV maker aims for most interaction between the car and the driver to occur through the screen. After all, Tesla's ultimate technological endgame is full autonomy. The bug or user error is the act of driving itself.\n\nWith the CLA, I felt Mercedes made a car that you'd prefer to drive — and everything from the premium-level interior to the AI voice assistant only helps you focus on that act.\n\nPart of the feeling is buoyed by the brand itself: There's something wholly uncool about spending 50 grand or more on a sporty Mercedes-Benz only to say that you don't really drive the thing.\n\nThat's not the most rational defense for buying a car. However, Mercedes itself almost advertises the CLA as an emotional experience rather than a rational purchase.\n\nSee how the German automaker talked about the CLA in some of its early press material: \"The most emotional vehicle in its class,\" \"sensual purity,\" and the \"style rebel\" that \"underscores the sporty side of the Mercedes-Benz brand.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called his cars a \"very sophisticated computer on wheels.\"\n\nWe're talking about very different audiences here.\n\nThe CLA does throw up some numbers that are competitive with the leading EV players: an EPA-estimated range of 374 miles, 268 horsepower, and a 10% to 80% charging time of 22 minutes for the CLA 250+ model.\n\nThe premium rear-wheel drive Model 3 I drove has an EPA-estimated range of 363 miles. Tesla doesn't break down horsepower or charging time the same way Mercedes does, but, according to Kelley Blue Book, most Tesla models can charge to 80% around 15 minutes.\n\nMercedes also plans to introduce a hybrid variant of the CLA, utilizing the automaker's new \"modular architecture.\" This is essentially the skateboard platform that EV companies use, allowing them to build other models efficiently on the same foundation.\n\nMercedes is just one of many legacy automakers that are now hedging their bets on EV-only segments and expanding hybrid options.\n\nIf the vast majority of consumers continue to remain uncertain about electric cars, Tesla is unfortunately boxed out of that game.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

    "fullText": "Tesla has scaled its California \"Robotaxi\" program at a lightning-fast pace.\n\nTo date, the automaker has registered 1,655 vehicles for its ride-hailing service in the state, a spokesperson from the California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider. The company has registered 798 drivers, the spokesperson said.\n\nThat's up from 28 cars and 128 drivers in August, when the service launched, according to the CPUC.\n\nThe vehicle number reflects car that have been approved for use, not the actual operational fleet number. The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox and Waymo run fully autonomously.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for a permit to test its self-driving software with a test driver.\n\nTesla's \"Robotaxi\" isn't registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California, which maintains some of the strictest AV regulations in the country. The company has not applied for a driverless testing permit, a DMV representative told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's permit from the CPUC allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public. A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "CEO Elon Musk claimed more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle following its botched reveal in 2019.",
    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "description": "Tesla was struggling hard as recently as March. But its stock has soared as the company's fortunes have turned around.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a good year for comebacks.\n\nWe got the first \"Final Destination\" movie in 14 years. Future NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Philip Rivers unretired last week after nearly five years away. And of course you have Michael Burry ferociously blogging up a storm after an extended public absence.\n\nThe stock market has also seen its share of reclamation stories, with none more high-profile than Tesla, the eternal lightning rod.\n\nAfter a post-election Trump bump in late 2024, the company endured a difficult first quarter. Shares were nearly cut in half as CEO Elon Musk pivoted to government work by spearheading DOGE, and as sales fell globally. It was a grim time for shareholders.\n\nBut the company was able to turn things around, and currently sits just below record highs. The chart below, and the accompanying sections, trace the timeline of Tesla's stock resurgence.\n\nApril: Musk steps back from DOGE\n\nInvestors were getting restless that Musk was too focused on Washington, and not focused enough on making EVs. Then, when he said he'd step away from DOGE, they breathed a collective sigh of relief, helping along a 25% rally over just four days.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to lower their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days. The stock ended up rising 17% that week. There would be further agreements with China, but this initial one marked the biggest inflection point.\n\nEarly September: Tesla introduces possible $1 trillion pay package for Musk\n\nThe argument in favor of such a lucrative package was that the continued presence of Musk as CEO makes up a large chunk of the company's value.\n\nIts introduction showed Tesla's board was serious about keeping him around, which pleased investors. Shares rallied 17% over the following week. The package was ultimately approved in November, which also pushed the stock higher.\n\nMid September: Musk buys back a bunch of shares\n\nTalk about throwing fuel on the fire. Musk's decision to buy back $1 billion worth of Tesla stock ignited another leg higher, pushing shares 7% higher in a single session. They then climbed an additional 8% the following week.\n\nMusk being willing to spend his own money on Tesla stock signaled confidence in the business, and comfort with valuation levels.\n\nNovember: Fed comments clinch a December rate cut\n\nThe December rate cut may have come and gone as a relative formality, which makes it easy to forget that it was still in jeopardy as recently as mid-November. Then, New York Fed President John Williams sealed the deal with some commentary on Nov. 21. Tesla rallied sharply alongside the broader market, soaring 10% over the next week.\n\nIt's been mostly a straight shot higher to records since then.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\n\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\n\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk.\n\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett, the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\n\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle, Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\n\nThe serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted.\n\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\n\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI. In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.",

    "description": "Tesla stock staged a massive rebound, with shares climbing 120% from their low in April on a handful of positive catalysts.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock has mounted a stunning comeback in the latter half of this year.\n\nShares of Elon Musk's carmaker have erased their losses after plummeting earlier in 2025, and, as of this week, have clawed their way back to all-time highs.\n\nTesla closed at a record $489.88 a share on Tuesday. The stock is up 121% from its low in early April. Shares are up 26% for the year as of Wednesday morning, putting the company in the upper echelon of Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThe rally in recent months marks a remarkable turnaround for the stock, which has been battered in volatile trading and mired in a bear market for much of the first half of the year. Shares of the EV company had plunged more than 50% from their peak in December 2024 to their trough in April, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's rally this week to all-time highs came as Musk gave a bullish update on Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin. Investors have pinned a lot of hopes on self-driving tech amid this year's dip in car sales. Along with its robotics initiatives, markets see Tesla's non-auto business as the primary bullish catalyst heading into 2026.\n\nA general risk on mood amid rate cuts and more optimistic forecasts for stocks next year has also helped spur the latest leg of Tesla's comeback.\n\nHere's what has driven the stock's blistering rally in the last several months.\n\nMusk said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. The news sparked relief among investors, who have long complained that the CEO may be too distracted by his sprawling empire of companies and his political ambitions to focus on Tesla.\n\nShares rose nearly 20% after Musk made the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to slash their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days.\n\nThe agreement temporarily removed a key headwind for Tesla, which sources its supplies heavily from China. The nation also makes up a key market for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nTesla shares rose alongside the broader market, climbing nearly 9% after the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nSince then, other positive developments between the US and China have also helped give Tesla a boost:\n\nElon Musk appeared to mend his relationship with President Donald Trump after the two billionaires publicly feuded over Musk's opposition to the Republicans' tax and spending bill.\n\nIn the heat of their argument, the White House said Trump was considering selling or giving away the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year. The president also threatened to yank contracts the government struck with Elon Musk's companies.\n\n\"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,\" Musk wrote in a post on X on June 11.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post in an interview the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice.\"\n\nTesla shares rose 6% through the end of the week.\n\nTesla rolled out a new pay package for Musk after a Delaware Court struck down a previous $56 billion package.\n\nShares rose 12% in the week following the announcement on September 5.\n\nThe new package, from which Musk can earn up to $1 trillion, was approved by shareholders in November and comes attached with aggressive targets. For Musk to earn his massive payout, he must boost the company's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million cars a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots.\n\nOn September 12, Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a securities filing released the following Monday. The purchase boosted Musk's ownership of the company from around 13% to 15%.\n\nInvestors are looking at the purchase as a sign of commitment from Musk, who has been accused of neglecting his duties at Tesla since he first sought to acquire Twitter in 2022.\n\nTesla shares rose another 3% through the end of the week.",

    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",
