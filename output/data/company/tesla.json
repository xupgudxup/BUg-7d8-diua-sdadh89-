    "description": "\"It was very dark and murky.\"",
    "fullText": "Officials in South Texas have raised concerns after discovering that Tesla has been discharging treated wastewater from its lithium refinery into a local drainage ditch without notifying the district that maintains it.\n\nAccording to KRIS 6 News, Tesla holds a state-issued permit allowing it to discharge up to 231,000 gallons of treated wastewater per day into an unnamed ditch that eventually flows into Petronila Creek.\n\nBut drainage district officials said they were never notified that a pipeline had been installed across their easement. When workers encountered the discharge, they were alarmed by what they saw.\n\n\"It was very dark and murky,\" drainage district consultant Steve Ray said. \"I would say it was actually black. We're used to seeing good running water, and so we didn't know exactly what it was.\"\n\nThe lithium refinery, which began operations in December 2024, produces battery-grade lithium for electric vehicle batteries.\n\nWhile Tesla's permit from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality allows wastewater discharge, it specifically notes that it does not grant the right to use private or public property for conveyance.\n\nPetronila Creek flows into Baffin Bay, a sensitive coastal ecosystem that supports tourism and local livelihoods.\n\nIf large volumes of water — even treated water — were to overwhelm the ditch or carry unexpected pollutants downstream, it could threaten water quality and wildlife.\n\nBeyond environmental questions, this situation may raise concerns for customers. Tesla has previously faced scrutiny over product reliability and transparency.\n\nFor example, a class action lawsuit alleged that electronically actuated door handles on certain 2014-16 Model S vehicles \"routinely fail,\" leaving some owners unable to enter their cars without climbing through another door.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla sales in the United Kingdom dropped more than 57% year over year in January as competitors gained ground.\n\nWhile the company has helped accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, public trust plays a key role in continued growth.\n\nDrainage district officials said Tesla has been responsive since concerns were raised, and both parties are scheduled to meet to coordinate next steps.\n\nFor residents, staying informed about local water management meetings and environmental oversight can help ensure transparency.\n\nFor drivers considering an electric vehicle, it's worth remembering that the broader EV market includes many options beyond one brand.\n\nAs the drainage district works to clarify what's flowing through its ditches, officials say their focus is simple: protecting the community and the waterways that support it.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk has never been one to hold back on social media, and his latest outburst has the internet buzzing. The Tesla CEO took to X, the platform he owns, to blast The New York Times over a decade-old opinion piece that recently popped back into the spotlight.\n\nThe article in question suggested viewing pedophilia through a mental health lens rather than purely as criminal behavior. Musk's sharp words have reignited debates about media responsibility and child safety, drawing in politicians, influencers, and everyday users. Let's break down what happened, why it matters, and the wave of reactions it sparked.\n\nBack in October 2014, The New York Times published an op-ed by Margo Kaplan, a law professor at Rutgers University. Titled \"Pedophilia: A Disorder, Not a Crime,\" the piece argued that attractions to children should be treated as a psychiatric issue.\n\nKaplan pointed out that the DSM-5, the manual used by mental health professionals, classifies pedophilia as a paraphilic disorder when it causes distress or leads to harmful actions. She stressed that while any abuse of children remains illegal, recognizing the attraction as a disorder could help people get therapy before they act on impulses.\n\nThis wasn't a news story from the paper's reporters; it was an opinion column meant to spark discussion. Kaplan used examples from other mental health conditions, like substance abuse disorders, where treatment focuses on prevention rather than punishment for thoughts alone. At the time, it drew some criticism, but it faded from headlines.\n\nFast forward to early 2025, and the piece resurfaced amid broader talks about child exploitation cases, including references to high-profile figures like Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. Senator Mike Lee from Utah shared a screenshot of the headline on X, calling the idea \"delusional\" and insisting, \"No, it's a crime.\" His post quickly gained traction, setting the stage for Musk's involvement.\n\nMusk didn't hesitate to jump in. Replying to Lee's post, he labeled The New York Times \"utterly disgusting\" for running the op-ed. In another related comment, he went further, calling the outlet \"evil propaganda.\"\n\nThis fits Musk's pattern of clashing with mainstream media; he has accused them of bias and sensationalism on multiple occasions. For instance, he has previously criticized The Times for their coverage of Tesla and his personal life, once even tweeting that he might create a site to rate journalists' credibility.\n\nWhat made this slam stand out was the timing. Musk has positioned himself as a vocal advocate for child protection online. He has pushed for stricter content moderation on X to combat child exploitation material, and he often shares posts highlighting threats to kids. Users on the platform amplified his words, with his response racking up millions of views in hours.\n\nOne X user echoed Musk by saying the framing was \"dangerous\" and eroded trust in legacy media. Musk's history adds layers here; he once faced a defamation lawsuit after calling a British cave explorer \"pedo guy\" during the 2018 Thai cave rescue drama. A jury cleared him in 2019, ruling the term was an insult, not a factual claim.\n\nKaplan's piece wasn't defending child abuse; it made clear that actions like molestation are crimes deserving punishment. Instead, she highlighted how stigma prevents people with these attractions from seeking help.\n\nShe cited studies showing that many pedophiles never offend, but fear of legal repercussions keeps them silent. For example, she referenced Germany's Dunkelfeld project, which offers confidential therapy to non-offenders and has reportedly reduced risks.\n\nCritics, however, argue this approach blurs lines. They say labeling it a disorder risks normalizing something society views as morally wrong. Senator Lee's post captured this sentiment, rejecting any nuance and focusing on protection.\n\nThe op-ed also discussed legal barriers, like mandatory reporting laws that might deter therapy seekers. Kaplan suggested reforms to balance help with safety, such as better access to treatment without automatic criminalization for attractions alone. Despite these points, the headline's stark phrasing has fueled misinterpretations, leading some to claim The Times was soft on pedophilia.\n\nThe online response split sharply, with many echoing Musk's disgust. One X user wrote, \"Elon calling out NYT’s disgusting 2014 piece loud & clear — pedophilia is a CRIME, not a disorder to normalize. No debate. No excuses. Protect kids first, always.\"\n\nNot all agreed, though; some defended the op-ed's intent to promote treatment and reduce harm. A commenter noted, \"If The New York Times thought they were publishing nuance, they ended up serving nonsense. Elon calling them 'utterly disgusting' is blunt but when the subject is pedophilia, there’s no room for clever spin.\"\n\nOthers brought up unrelated scandals, like Epstein files, to question media priorities. The debate spilled into broader talks on U.K. policies releasing offenders for space, with Musk previously saying, \"I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.\"\n\nThis episode highlights ongoing tensions between free speech, mental health advocacy, and zero-tolerance for child harm. Musk's platform amplified the debate, showing how old content can fuel new fires in today's fast-paced online world. As discussions continue, one thing is clear: topics like this touch deep nerves, prompting calls for accountability from all sides.",

    "description": "The stainless steel pickup truck is Tesla's first real flop.",
    "fullText": "Last night, Tesla made some hefty cuts to Cybertruck pricing in an effort to stimulate some sales. The bombastic tri-motor “Cyberbeast” is $15,000 cheaper at $99,990, albeit by dropping some previously free features like supercharging and FSD. And there’s now a new $59,990 entry-level model, a dual-motor configuration with a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the same 4.1-second 0–60 mph (0-97 km/h) time as the $79,990 premium all-wheel drive version.\n\nThat actually makes the new entry-level model a good deal, at least in terms of Cybertrucks. Last year, the company introduced and then eliminated a single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, which found few takers when priced at $69,990; an extra motor for $10,000 less is quite a savings, and actually slightly cheaper than the price originally advertised for the RWD truck.\n\nAs you might expect, Tesla has made some changes to get down to the new price. The range and 0–60 mph time might be the same as the more expensive dual-motor Cybertruck, but towing capacity is reduced from 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg) to 7,000 lbs (3,175kg), and cargo capacity drops from 2,500 lbs (1,134 kg) to 2,006 lbs (910 kg).\n\nSteel springs and adaptive dampers replace the air suspension. There are different tail lights. The inside features textile seats—maybe someone there reads Ars—but the cheapest Cybertruck does without seat ventilation for the front row or seat heaters for the second row. There’s also a different console, no AC outlets in the cabin, and fewer speakers, with no active noise-cancellation system.\n\nBut it’s still $20,000 more expensive than Elon Musk told us it would be during the angular, unpainted vehicle’s reveal back in 2019. Back then, Musk promised a $39,900 price tag, as well as a few other things that never saw the light of day, like a true monocoque construction.\n\nDesigning and building the odd-looking vehicle proved particularly troublesome for Tesla, which has never found those processes particularly easy. While other new Tesla models found themselves mired in “production hell,” in 2023, Musk said that “we dug our own grave with the Cybertruck.”\n\nIndeed, if the company based its business plans on the public sales projections of 250,000 trucks a year—something Musk said would happen by 2025—that certainly would be a problem.\n\nAppealing to neither traditional pickup truck buyers, who have largely rejected going to electric vehicles, nor the majority of EV enthusiasts even before Musk’s politics further soured things, fewer than 39,000 Cybertrucks were sold in 2024, and just over 20,000 found homes in 2025. The Edsel might be Ford’s most famous failure, but even it posted superior sales numbers during its relatively brief life.",

    "fullText": "Tesla rival Lucid is slashing its workforce as the EV winter tightens its grip.\n\nEV startup Lucid is cutting 12% of US employees, according to an email interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent to unaffected employees on Friday, which Business Insider has seen.\n\nWinterhoff said the cuts would exclude hourly production employees in manufacturing, logistics, and quality.\n\n\"This difficult but necessary decision was made to improve organisational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,\" he wrote.\n\nIt comes as Lucid faces a difficult environment for EV makers amid an industry-wide downturn, with EV sales plummeting industry-wide in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September.\n\nDespite slowing demand for electric vehicles in the US, Lucid's sales more than doubled last year, as it scaled up production of its new Gravity SUV.\n\nHowever, the EV startup continues to burn cash as it struggles to become profitable. In its most recent earnings in November, the company reported a net loss of nearly $1 billion.\n\nLucid reports Q4 earnings next week. Techcrunch first reported the layoffs.\n\nA Lucid spokesperson told Business Insider the cuts would not impact the company's hourly production workforce in Arizona, adding that the cuts were designed to \"streamline\" the organisation as it seeks long-term growth and margin improvement.\n\n\"We are grateful for the contributions of all impacted employees and are providing resources, benefits, and support to assist them through this transition,\" they said.\n\nRead Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff's full memo:\n\nToday I want to share an important business update. We have implemented a 12% reduction of our U.S. workforce, excluding hourly production employees in manufacturing, logistics, and quality. This difficult but necessary decision was made to improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability. If you are receiving this message, your role is not impacted.\n\nWe are streamlining our organization so we can operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long-term growth. We will continue to evaluate our day-to-day work to ensure that our time, energy, and resources remain focused on the initiatives that drive the greatest impact. This disciplined approach to execution is a core operational imperative for Lucid.\n\nImportantly, today's actions do not affect our strategy. Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.\n\nSaying goodbye to colleagues is never easy. We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today's actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period. As we move through today, I ask everyone to treat one another with empathy, professionalism, and respect, recognizing the personal impact these changes have on our teammates.\n\nTo sustain and build on progress made in 2025, we must remain focused, operate with discipline, and execute with urgency. I know we are asking a great deal of our team, and I sincerely appreciate your continued commitment, resilience, and professionalism.\n\nI will address today's actions and answer questions during Monday's Town Hall. As always, you may presubmit your questions on The Hub.",

    "description": "Tesla said it only hired US-based human helpers to assist its robotaxis, after Waymo came under fire for using remote workers in the Philippines.",
    "fullText": "Tesla and Waymo's battle to win the robotaxi race is getting catty.\n\nIn regulatory comments published on Wednesday, Tesla said it only hired US-based human helpers to assist its robotaxis when they get stuck, after Waymo came under fire for using remote workers in the Philippines to guide their autonomous vehicles out of sticky situations.\n\nThe two robotaxi rivals have been engaged in regulatory sniping as they jockey to shape California's new autonomous vehicle regulations.\n\nIn comments submitted to the state's Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday, Tesla referred to the December 2025 San Francisco power outage that left some Waymo vehicles stranded in traffic.\n\nWaymo later said the blackout caused a spike in requests from its robotaxis to the company's remote assistance (RA) team, who assist the company's robotaxis when they get into unusual situations. The surge in requests ultimately overwhelmed the system, Waymo said.\n\nIn its comments to California regulators, Tesla said its ride-hailing service in the state — which uses human drivers overseeing the automaker's Full Self-Driving software — was not impacted by the outage.\n\nTesla said that the Waymo shutdown raised \"important questions\" over the reliability of robotaxi fleets, adding that all of its remote robotaxi operators are based in the US.\n\n\"Tesla is working to ensure that its autonomous technology is developed, manufactured, and supported in the US,\" the company said.\n\nTesla added that domestically-based remote operators are more familiar with local road rules, more reliable at intervening when robotaxis run into trouble, have superior \"network connectivity,\" and are less vulnerable to cybersecurity threats.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment. Waymo declined to comment.\n\nWaymo has faced significant heat in recent weeks over its practice of employing remote workers to assist its autonomous vehicles, a common practice in the robotaxi industry.\n\nIn a Senate hearing earlier this month, Waymo chief safety officer Mauricio Peña was grilled by Sen. Ed Markey over the hiring of remote workers in the Philippines to assist its robotaxis in difficult situations, which Markey called \"unacceptable\" and suggested could pose safety and cybersecurity issues.\n\nWaymo defended its remote assistant program in a letter to Markey sent on Tuesday.\n\nIn the letter, Waymo said its RA agents do not directly drive their robotaxis but only provide \"advice and support\" when the self-driving system encounters a driving situation it can't handle.\n\nThe company said it had around 70 RA agents on duty at any given time, with half based in the US and half in the Philippines.\n\nWaymo added that its agents in the Philippines are required to have a local driver's license and receive training in US road laws, and said that more complex driving scenarios are handled exclusively by a specialist team based in the US.\n\nThe Google-backed robotaxi firm has continued to face pressure from lawmakers over its foreign remote assistance teams. On Monday, House Rep. Earl Carter sent a letter to Transport Secretary Sean Duffy calling for an investigation into robotaxi companies using \"foreign-based Remote Assistance Operators.\"\n\nWaymo and Tesla are racing to roll out robotaxis in a host of US cities this year. Waymo recently announced plans to test its vehicles in Sacramento and Boston, while Tesla began offering autonomous rides without a safety driver in Austin last month and has begun production of its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.",

In 2022, the DMV had accused Tesla of misleading consumers by using “autopilot” and “full self-driving” for its advanced driver-assistance features.\n\nThe DMV narrowed its focus in December to the term “autopilot” as Tesla revised its use of the term “full self-driving” to clarify that driver supervision is required. “Autopilot” enables Tesla vehicles to accelerate, brake and remain within their lanes on highways. “Full self-driving” allows vehicles to change lanes and respond to traffic signals on city streets.\n\nThe judge had recommended that regulators suspend Tesla’s license to sell cars for 30 days, but the regulators gave the company a 90-day window to make changes. They decided it had done that sufficiently to fix the deceptive marketing.\n\nThe reprieve from the California DMV comes as Tesla and other electric vehicle makers grapple with a plunge in demand after the expiration of key tax credits that had boosted sales. Musk has switched the company’s focus toward robotaxis equipped with self-driving technology, as well as humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "Tesla has avoided a 30-day suspension of its dealer and manufacturer licenses in California. The cost: \"Autopilot.\"\n\nThe reprieve comes two months after the state ordered the automaker to stop using the term in its vehicle marketing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said Tesla had taken the required corrective action following a December administrative ruling over the marketing of its driver-assistance features.\n\nIn November 2023, the DMV accused Tesla of misleading consumers by advertising its systems — branded as \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" — in ways that implied the vehicles were capable of autonomous driving.\n\nThe decision effectively ends a three-year legal fight between Tesla and California regulators. The state is critical for the EV maker — it's the car company's largest US sales market and home to two manufacturing hubs.\n\nAutopilot was the name of Tesla's Level-2 driver-assistance feature, including lane tracing and cruise control adjustment. The company's then-called Full-Self Driving included Level-3 driver assistance, in which the car would turn its wheels and apply the brakes, but required human eyes on the road and readiness to take control at a moment's notice.\n\nAn administrative law judge in November 2025 concluded that Tesla's use of the term \"Autopilot\" violated California law and recommended suspending the company's licenses for 30 days if the automaker continued using the branding in its marketing materials.\n\nThe DMV adopted the judge's findings in December but permanently stayed the suspension and gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n\nTesla had already modified its \"Full Self-Driving\" branding to \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" in September 2024.\n\nThe company also clarified that the system worked \"with minimal driver intervention.\"\n\n🤔 @Tesla is no longer selling \"FSD\" as a package. They are only selling \"FSD (Supervised)\". And there is no longer the promise that car will completely drive itself: only that car will drive \"with minimal driver intervention\"\n\nI don't think we are getting anything more than… pic.twitter.com/w88ptYDZ2W\n\nIn January, Tesla discontinued its Autopilot packages for new vehicles in the US and Canada and eliminated the $8,000 upfront purchase option for Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe move leaves FSD (Supervised) available only as a $99-per-month subscription, further tying Tesla's self-driving ambitions to recurring software revenue.\n\nBoosting self-driving subscriptions is an integral part of CEO Elon Musk's potential trillion-dollar pay package.",

    "description": "Electric vehicle sales fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, as the industry braces for a deep freeze.",
    "fullText": "The EV winter is going global — and even Tesla isn't immune.\n\nElectric vehicle sales across the auto industry fell 3% worldwide in January compared to the same period last year, according to data from Benchmark Intelligence published Friday, as policy changes in the US and China threaten to throw the industry into a deep freeze.\n\nIn North America and China, sales fell 33% and 20% respectively last month.\n\nEV sales in the US have plummeted since the removal of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in September, and CEOs and industry experts have warned of a bumpy few years ahead.\n\nIn China, EVs accounted for around half of all vehicles sold last year — but companies are facing their own challenges after the government moved to end a key tax exemption for EV purchases and adjusted its trade-in scheme to make it less generous for battery-powered vehicles.\n\nChina's EV wobble has also hit its most successful foreign import — Tesla.\n\nElon Musk's automaker sold fewer than 20,000 vehicles in China in January, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, its lowest figure since late 2022.\n\nUnlike many other Western carmakers in China, Tesla has largely managed to fend off a wave of local rivals and protect its market share in the world's largest auto market.\n\nHowever, a slowing EV market and a lack of new products — barring refreshes and variants, Tesla hasn't launched a new vehicle in China since the Model Y in 2021 — has left the US automaker vulnerable.\n\nIndustry data published last week suggests that Tesla's Model Y was outsold in January by more than two to one by Xiaomi's YU7, which was widely hailed as a serious rival to Tesla's bestselling EV when the smartphone maker launched it last June.\n\nAnd last year, BYD took Tesla's crown as the world's largest seller of battery-powered vehicles — although the Chinese company also saw its January sales fall 30% year over year, signaling a difficult start to 2026.\n\nOutside of China, things aren't looking much better for Tesla.\n\nThe company continues to struggle in Europe, after facing major backlash last year over CEO Musk's interventions into local politics and endorsement of the German far-right party AfD.\n\nDespite staging a recovery in some markets, such as Spain and Italy in January, Tesla's registrations also collapsed by 42% in France and fell to just 82 cars in EV-friendly Norway.\n\nIn the UK, where Tesla's Chinese rivals do not face tariffs, BYD sold four times as many cars as Tesla last month, after the Austin-based automaker's registrations fell by half.\n\nThe ongoing slump comes despite Europe being one of the few regions to see a bump in EV demand so far this year. Electric vehicle sales grew by nearly 25% year-over-year in January, per Benchmark figures.\n\nTesla's struggles in China and Europe mean its attempt to return to growth after two years of annual sales declines is off to a rough start.\n\nThe company has also faced a difficult spell in the US following the end of the tax credit, with sales in the final three months of 2025 falling 15% year over year, per figures from Cox Automotive — although the brand's January sales were only 2% lower than last year.\n\nTesla is by no means the only US automaker taking a hit in the EV market. The Detroit \"big three\" of Ford, GM, and Stellantis have collectively announced over $50 billion in charges related to their EV businesses in recent months, as they switch gears to sell more gas-powered and hybrid vehicles. Just 90,000 electric vehicles were sold in North America in January, according to Benchmark's figures.\n\nGetting caught in the EV winter might not bother Tesla's management, though, with the company rapidly shifting its focus away from the traditional auto industry.\n\nMusk told investors last month that Tesla will sunset its pioneering Model X and S models to build a new production line for its Optimus humanoid robot, and predicted that the company's upcoming Cybercab robotaxi will make current transportation methods obsolete.\n\n\"We're literally saying what we're going to do and have said what we're going to do for a while,\" Musk said\n\n\"I think long-term, really the only vehicles that we'll make will be autonomous vehicles, with the exception of the next-generation Roadster,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "Tesla says its purpose-built robotaxi just reached an important manufacturing milestone.\n\nIn an X post on Tuesday, the company said the Cybercab, a two-door car without a steering wheel, came off the production line at Tesla's sprawling Gigafactory in Austin.\n\n\"Congratulations to the Tesla team on making the first production Cybercab!\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on X.\n\nThe Cybercab was designed for Tesla's nascent robotaxi ride-hailing program.\n\nTesla's robotaxi program has so far deployed only 2025 Model Ys and mostly relies on human safety monitors to supervise rides. Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides to the public in January.\n\nUnlike the Model Y, the Cybercab doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals — it's intended to be fully autonomous. Amazon's Zoox similarly manufactures purpose-built robotaxis designed solely to transport passengers.\n\nTesla has said it expects to start production of the Cybercab in April.\n\nWhat's less clear is the timeline for when the automaker expects the Cybercab to be fully street legal.\n\nFederal vehicle safety standards were written with human control systems like a steering wheel in mind, which means Tesla would likely need special approval from regulators for any requirements it can't meet. Notably, Zoox received such a federal exemption and now operates a limited public service in Las Vegas and San Francisco.\n\nMusk also said people will have the option to buy the car. Selling a car without pedals or steering controls not only requires clearing federal regulatory hurdles but could also expose Tesla to a patchwork of state-by-state rules governing registration, insurance, and autonomous vehicle operation.\n\n\"What we designed is optimized for autonomy,\" Musk said during an earnings call in October 2024. \"It will cost on the order of — cost roughly 25K, so it is a 25K car. And you can, you will be able to buy one exclusively if you want.\"\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "The Detroit automaker on Tuesday showed off some of the engineering advances behind its new $30,000 electric pickup, which launches in 2027.",
    "fullText": "Ford is taking a leaf out of Tesla's book for its upcoming affordable EV truck.\n\nThe Detroit automaker on Tuesday showed off some of the engineering advances behind its new $30,000 electric pickup, which launches in 2027.\n\nIn addition to improved aerodynamics and a new battery system, Ford said its new EV production line would deploy unicasting for the first time. It's a process that uses giant hydraulic presses to shape molten aluminium into large pieces of the vehicle frame, reducing the number of parts and allowing different sections of the vehicle to be assembled separately.\n\nTesla famously pioneered this technique, which is also known as \"gigacasting.\" Alan Clarke, a former Tesla executive poached by Ford in 2022 to develop its next-generation EVs, said adopting unicasting would allow Ford to build electric vehicles that are lighter than the competition, including Tesla's Model Y.\n\n\"We think that compared to the best one on the market today, we're something like 27% lighter,\" Clarke told reporters in a Q&A on Thursday.\n\nFord said that the unicasting approach means that its new electric pickup truck would use just two body parts in its front and rear structure, compared to 147 on Ford's Maverick pickup.\n\nTesla has been using large-scale aluminium castings on its production lines since 2020. A number of other automakers, including Toyota and Volvo, have since adopted the technique. In 2023, Reuters reported that Ford had purchased a giant \"gigapress\" for R&D purposes from the same Italian supplier used by Tesla.\n\nClark said that Ford's engineers had \"obsessed\" over cutting down on weight to increase its range.\n\n\"We know that many customers expect more than 300 miles of range, and the solution up until now has been to install bigger, more expensive batteries,\" he said.\n\n\"This increases the weight, and that requires even more energy to move around,\" Clarke added.\n\nFord's $30,000 electric truck will instead rely on weight reductions and improved aerodynamics to boost range, Clarke said, with the team working on the electric truck stacked full of ex-Formula 1 aerodynamic engineers.\n\nThe company has also turned to a new battery based on Lithium Iron-Phosphate chemistry, which is popular with Chinese EV makers. The battery will be built in Michigan with technology licensed from a China-based firm, CATL.\n\nFord plans to use the same unicast system for its upcoming lineup of electric vehicles. The company is planning to build at least five vehicles on the new EV platform, potentially including SUVs and commercial vans.\n\nFord has not yet shared the price or range of its electric pickup, which the company began developing in a separate \"skunkworks\" team based in California in 2022.\n\nThe company's EVs have, in the past, lagged behind the competition on weight and efficiency. CEO Jim Farley said in a November podcast interview that when Ford took apart Tesla's Model 3 for the first time, the company realized its Mustang Mach-E model had about 1 mile more electrical wiring than its rival, making it far heavier.\n\nFord largely abandoned its efforts to break Tesla's dominance with a lineup of large, expensive EVs in December, after the end of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in the US sparked a major slowdown in demand. The company took a nearly $20 billion EV-related charge as it shifted production toward hybrid vehicles, and scrapped the all-electric version of its F-150 Lightning pickup.\n\nInstead, Ford is betting on smaller, more affordable EVs like the upcoming $30,000 pickup, which Farley has described as the automaker's modern-day \"Model T moment,\" a nod to the company's early 1900s car that revolutionized the automotive industry.\n\nIn its earnings last week, Ford reported that its EV division lost $4.8 billion in 2025, with another $4 billion to $5 billion in losses expected this year.",

    "description": "Tesla eliminated the option to purchase Full Self-Driving with a one-time fee over the weekend.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has shifted its Full Self-Driving feature to a subscription model.\n\nOver the weekend, the company removed the option to purchase the feature in the US via a one-time flat fee of $8,000.\n\nFor years, Tesla owners have been able to purchase the service with a one-time payment that would allow them to use it for the full lifespan of their vehicle. Now, the driver-assist feature is available only via a $99-per-month subscription.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk first announced in January that the change would take effect the following month. In the past, Musk has said that Teslas would serve as \"appreciating assets,\" suggesting owners could benefit as the software became increasingly more autonomous.\n\nThe decision to remove lifetime FSD purchases comes shortly after the carmaker stopped offering Autopilot as a free feature for new Tesla purchases. Previously, Autopilot acted as a free driver-assist feature on the expressway, while FSD was an additional paid feature for navigating city streets.\n\nTesla first introduced FSD in 2016, and the pricing has swung dramatically over time. In its early days, FSD cost around $5,000, later climbing to a peak of $15,000. In 2024, Tesla reduced the upfront price to $8,000. The carmaker first introduced a subscription option in 2021 for $199 per month, but the price was later lowered to $99 per month.\n\nMusk said in a post on X last month that the carmaker will raise FSD subscription prices as its \"capabilities improve.\"\n\nTesla's move to a more subscription-focused model reflects a broader industry trend. Under an executive performance plan approved last year, Musk's compensation depends in part on reaching 10 million active FSD subscriptions.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Automakers followed Tesla's lead, designing EV interiors as screen-centric cockpits. Now, some are adding back in physical buttons.",
    "fullText": "When automakers went electric, they also went sleek and digital.\n\nClimate control knobs disappeared. Door handles tucked themselves into body panels. Audio volume dials became haptic sliders.\n\nNow, as automakers face regulatory pressures and customer blowback, some of the industry's biggest names are reversing course and reintroducing physical buttons.\n\nAudi's upcoming 2027 e-tron updates promise a more \"tactile\" interior experience. Ferrari's first EV — designed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive — is filled with physical controls. Even Tesla is redesigning its flush door handles.\n\n\"We will never, ever make this mistake anymore,\" Andreas Mindt, the head of design at Volkswagen, told AutoCar last year when asked about filling cars with digital screens.\n\n\"Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.\"\n\nThe move to giant screens was about aesthetics, economics — and influence.\n\nSam Abuelsamid, co-host of the Wheel Bearings podcast, told Business Insider it all started with Tesla's lead.\n\nTesla's Model S, its first-ever ground-up design, centered much of its interface around a 17-inch touchscreen.\n\n\"It gives cars a more high-tech look and feel,\" Abuelsamid said. \"Also, it cut costs. It costs a lot of money to develop and validate physical controls.\"\n\nWhen Tesla's sales started to take off, the industry tried to mimic the sleek styling. Throughout the industry, the influence of Tesla's pared-down approach was evident.\n\nVolkswagen's ID.4 never had climate knobs. Rivian's door handles electronically slid inside the door frame. Ford added huge tablets to the center of its Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n\nEven Tesla took it a step further, removing the physical turn-signal stalks from the Model 3 — before bringing them back.\n\nAt first, the tech-forward approach worked for the target audience.\n\n\"It goes back to the types of consumers who adopt these technologies,\" Eleftheria Kontou, an assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois, said to Business Insider.\n\n\"Environmentalists and technically-inclined shoppers are the most common EV buyers,\" Kontou added. \"They want a new tech gadget, so EVs are a very attractive option.\"\n\nBut as EVs moved beyond tech enthusiasts and into the broader market, expectations shifted.\n\nAs EVs went mainstream, the downside of screen-heavy cabins became harder to ignore.\n\n\"The core safety concern isn't mechanical reliability — it's distraction,\" Spencer Penn, a former Tesla Model 3 engineer and now CEO of sourcing platform LightSource, told Business Insider. \"Touchscreens require visual attention and lack haptic feedback.\"\n\nThe advantage of physical controls, he said, is ergonomic and psychological immediacy rather than mechanical redundancy.\n\nThat usability tension has begun drawing regulatory scrutiny.\n\nChina recently moved to ban certain flush and hidden door handle designs over safety concerns. In the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has investigated complaints involving electronic door mechanisms. And in 2024, the European Transport Safety Council said it would not afford five-star safety ratings to vehicles with too many screens.\n\nThe EV revolution was built on the promise that cars could function more like smartphones — constantly updated, endlessly configurable, and increasingly software-driven.\n\nThat vision isn't disappearing — and touchscreens aren't going anywhere.\n\nGeneral Motors is building subscription revenue around digital features. Tesla continues to push new full self-driving updates. Ford's next generation of EVs will rely heavily on cloud-connected systems.\n\nInstead, they're restoring some physical controls for high-frequency or safety-critical functions — volume, climate adjustments, hazard lights, windshield wipers — while leaving navigation, media, and ambient light settings to digital menus.\n\n\"Inspired by the functional aesthetic of the well-received Audi Concept C and the tactile experience of its physical controls reflecting mechanical quality, the familiar scroll wheel returns, permitting operation of various functions and replacing the previous touch-sensitive interface controlling volume and MMI menu selection,\" Audi says about its 2027 e-tron.\n\nBut even in a software-defined future, drivers still expect something smartphones don't require: the ability to drive down the road without looking at a screen.\n\n\"It is less expensive when you remove dozens of switches with a singular screen panel,\" Penn said. \"However, it's more expensive if you misalign yourself with the voice of the customer.\"",

    "description": "\"Adds to the now-constant stream.\"",
    "fullText": "In what experts have deemed a mass exodus, a steady flow of high-ranking executives and managerial employees have been leaving Tesla since 2024.\n\nThis trend displays a growing discontent with the automaker following the company's shift toward robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nElectrek reported \"Benjamin Bate, Tesla's Director of Vehicle Operations and Engineering at Fremont, has left the automaker after over eight years. … [It] adds to the now-constant stream of experienced talent leaving Tesla.\"\n\nFrom head engineers and program managers to model manufacturing leads, sales executives, and vehicle designers, Tesla has lost talent from every corner of its automotive workforce. A commenter even noted people seem to be \"leaving the sinking ship.\"\n\nBeyond concerns over the company's spiral, Tesla has also been reported to have a severe employee morale issue. High-level, high-value employees are losing interest in their work, as \"Tesla is no longer innovating or pushing the envelope in automobiles,\" per Electrek.\n\nCompared to other EV makers such as Chevrolet, BMW, Ford, and even luxury brands including Porsche, Tesla has made no significant upgrades to vehicle performance in recent years.\n\nTesla's lack of development as an automobile producer has depleted its once-titanic status as an EV staple into a company that is falling behind and seemingly making no effort to compensate. Tesla customers may be negatively impacted as a result, owning vehicles from an automaker that is no longer focused on those vehicles.\n\nAs Tesla sales continue to decline — one 2025 report showed a nearly 28% year-over-year drop — those who own a Tesla may be worried. Without high demand, service could decrease or become unreliable. Additionally, with less competition, consumers suffer from higher prices and perhaps an industry-wide downturn.\n\nWhile Tesla may be falling behind its competitors' innovations in electric vehicles, many other options have opened up because Tesla took the first steps.\n\nChina's BYD has become the world's leading EV maker thanks to affordable prices and continuous upgrades and improvements. Companies that had not invested much energy into the EV market have now joined in on the ever-developing electric vehicle landscape.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnd as greener battery mining and sustainable production processes go mainstream, EVs are an increasingly better choice than traditional gas-powered cars.",

    "fullText": "Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts\n\nElon Musk’s longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n\nMusk’s posts included him repeatedly claiming white people face systemic discrimination, endorsing the conspiracy that there is an ongoing genocide against white people in countries around the world and promoting a claim that white people would be “slaughtered” by non-whites if they become a demographic minority.\n\n“If you stripped Elon Musk’s name off of these things and showed them to me, I would think that this was a white supremacist,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Extremism, who reviewed a selection of the posts.\n\nMusk has for years promoted anti-immigrant and far-right content in his posts, as well as endorsed rightwing activists and political parties around the globe. The Tesla CEO’s most recent output displays a more consistent and explicit engagement with white supremacist content and nativist activists than in the past, however, lending them the imprimatur of the world’s richest person and spreading their ideas to his audience of over 200 million followers. Beirich said he appeared “deep into the world of white nationalism”.\n\n“The White ‘liberal’ standard for behavior is extremely strict, but is only applied to Whites,” Musk said on 26 January, commenting on a post that claimed there was discrimination against white conservatives.\n\nMusk’s posts repeatedly echoed prominent white supremacist narratives and ideologies, said William Braniff, the former director of the Department of Homeland Security’s office for prevention of terrorism and extremism. Several of Musk’s posts included what Braniff described as “textbook examples” of white supremacist conspiracy theories such as “the great replacement” – a belief that liberal elites or Jewish people are conspiring to use immigration to replace white populations.\n\nThe danger of Musk’s obsession lies in mainstreaming ideas that are deeply tied to violence and discrimination, according to Braniff, who is now executive director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (Peril) at American University. “The great replacement has been an especially important mobilizing narrative for highly lethal white supremacist attacks in the United States and elsewhere,” he said.\n\nMusk has repeatedly denied he is racist or antisemitic, stated that he condemns terrorism and said he does not advocate for violence. He asserted in a 2024 interview with Don Lemon that he does not He also told Joe Rogan in March last year that he is not a Nazi, weeks after facing condemnations from Jewish groups and the chairman of the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel over his speech to Germany’s far-right AfD party in which he told Germans to move beyond their “past guilt”.\n\nAlthough Musk wrote a number of posts on race and immigration himself last month, much of his output involved reposting far-right activist accounts or replying to them with brief endorsements such as a bullseye emoji, implying agreement. On 10 January, Musk replied “yes” in reply to a post from a white nationalist account that claimed “race communism that destroyed Rhodesia and South Africa are the same things they are bringing to America and the rest of the Occident to turn us into the Global Favela”. The author of the post previously published a blog titled How To Build An American Orania – a reference to the privately owned, whites-only town of Orania in South Africa.\n\nSimilar interactions took place throughout the month. After a far-right influencer posted “they just want to eradicate White people it’s that simple” in reference to the New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration speech, Musk replied on 7 January “some people really do”. On 9 January, he wrote “true” in a quote-tweet of a post that claimed white people would be “slaughtered” as a minority and that “White solidarity is the only way to survive”. On 16 January, Musk reposted a rightwing influencer’s post claiming “white genocide is the official Democrat party platform”. The same day, he promoted another rightwing influencer’s anti-diversity post that used an AI-generated image of tattooed black women on Yale’s rowing team.\n\nWhile some of the accounts Musk interacted with are fringe social media influencers, several others are prominent far-right activists whose extremist views have been well-documented. On 17 January, Musk reposted a screed against “ethno-cultural upheaval” in Europe from Martin Sellner, far-right Austrian activist, who is the founder of the ethno-nationalist Identitarian Movement. Musk, who reinstated Sellner’s banned X account in 2024, replied to the anti-immigration post that “this is simply a statement of fact”.\n\n“Martin Sellner is probably the most significant global white supremacist right now,” Beirich said. “He’s the one who pushed the great replacement, and has now pushed the idea of remigration – ethnically cleansing western countries of non-whites.”\n\nSellner gave a presentation in 2024 at an event in Germany on the logistics of carrying out mass deportations that was attended by neo-Nazis and other extremists. The event sparked immense backlash and protests against the far-right across the northern European nation. Lawmakers attempted to ban him from the country. The Austrian activist also received a €1,500 donation from and communicated with white supremacist Brenton Tarrant, who would later go on to commit a terrorist attack in 2019 that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\n\n Sellner rejected being described as a white supremacist and said he respects “the dignity of all others” in a statement to the Guardian, while taking credit for politically mainstreaming the concepts of the great replacement and remigration. “Now, from Trump to Musk, everyone is talking about replacement migration, the ethnic vote and remigration,” Sellner said. He additionally claimed that the Potsdam event was “misrepresented” by media and that he rejected any form of terrorism. Sellner described his interactions with Tarrant, which included offering to get a drink with Tarrant if he ever visited Austria, as limited to standard thank-you emails to a donor.\n\nExtremism experts said the ideas Musk has publicized are deeply tied to some of the most notorious, violent extremist attacks of the past decade, including the 2018 antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh and the 2022 racist mass killing of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket. The shooter in Buffalo left a 180-page manifesto filled with mentions of white supremacist replacement theory.\n\nMusk’s posts also reflect an increasing embrace of white supremacist figures and talking points among prominent Republicans and government agencies in the past year. Some of that shift has played out on X, where Musk reinstated a number of formerly banned accounts such as prominent antisemite Nick Fuentes. Federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security have meanwhile posted content that aligns with white supremacist propaganda. Earlier this month, Donald Trump also drew widespread backlash after posting a racist video to his Truth Social platform that depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.\n\nMusk has repeatedly mocked those who have criticized his comments as far-right or racist, framing his views as common sense or simply reiterating facts and statistics. His rhetoric reflects a widespread tactic among people on the far-right, experts say, when extremists attempt to defend their worldview of an in-group of white people against everyone else.\n\n“That reductionist worldview breaks down when people in your in-group say you’re full of it, that what you’re saying is wrong,” Braniff said. “So now the main requirement is to attack the dissenting in-group, to delegitimize them as race traitors and as woke.”\n\nAs February began, Musk was still posting about race and immigration on a consistent basis. He replied to an anti-immigrant activist this week who claimed that Ireland’s civilization would end “because Irish men are afraid of being called racist and upsetting people from the 3rd world”.\n\n“Such men are pathetic traitors,” Musk responded.",

Musk did not respond to the investigation at the time.\n\n\"The funny part about that clown's analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX,\" Musk responded on X on Sunday, followed by two crying-laughing emojis. \"Where did the other 99% come from?\"\n\nTesla has a market capitalization of around $1.5 trillion. SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public at a similar valuation later this year.\n\nMusk's retort comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the tech billionaire, his companies, and their reliance on government support. Tesla is facing fresh questions over the feasibility of Musk's vision of self-driving cars and humanoid robots as its core auto business continues to slow. Meanwhile, SpaceX has moved to acquire Musk's AI company, xAI.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Musk replied to another user who wrote that Starlink \"already produces massive cash\" and \"Elon doesn't need military money.\"\n\n\"True. I love NASA, but they will only be ~5% of SpaceX revenue this year,\" Musk wrote. \"Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system.\"\n\nThe world's richest man later replied \"yes\" to a post saying the US government contracts with Musk because he's the \"most efficient vendor\" and saves the government money.\n\n\"SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money,\" Musk said in a X post last July. \"Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much!\"\n\nNASA relies heavily on SpaceX for transport to the International Space Station and for key elements of its moon-exploration program, Artemis. The Department of Defense taps Musk's rocket company for tasks such as satellite launches.\n\nAs an electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it sells to other automakers so they can comply with emissions standards and other requirements. Revenue from those accounted for about $2 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Musk has taken aim at government subsidies, saying that mature companies shouldn't receive them and public funds are better used elsewhere. His Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut support programs such as renewable energy incentives last year.",

    "fullText": "Raj Jegannathan, who was once tasked with managing Tesla's sales and service team in North America, announced his departure from the company on Monday.\n\nJegannathan, Tesla's vice president of IT, took over the sales organization shortly after Troy Jones, the former vice president of North America sales and service, left the company in July. During his time on the team, Jegannathan worked to incorporate more AI tools in sales and service team workflows, five people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\n\"A comprehensive end-to-end understanding of the business has been essential—enabling the team to harness AI effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes across products and customer support,\" Jegannathan wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nThe executive, who reported directly to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left the company over the weekend, a person with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider. Jegannathan has not been active on internal company systems since late January, and he has not worked closely with the sales team for a few months, people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\nPrior to taking over leadership of the sales team, Jegannathan worked in engineering and IT, rather than sales. He has worked at Tesla for over 13 years. Shortly after he took the reins, he became known for responding to sales and service requests on X.\n\nJegannathan has led the company through a tumultuous sales period. Tesla reported in January that its delivery numbers fell for the second year in a row. The carmaker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in deliveries during the quarter. Jegannathan led the sales efforts while Musk worked with the federal government as a part of the Department of Government Efficiency, before the organization was dismantled.\n\nSeveral of Musk's direct reports have left the company over the past year. One of Musk's top lieutenants, Omead Afshar, parted ways with the carmaker in June, and Milan Kovac, the head of Tesla's robotics division, left the company that same month.\n\nTesla and Jegannathan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "title": "Tesla says its cars should drive themselves as humans do. Waymo says the bar is higher.",
    "description": "Tesla says cars can drive themselves with only cameras just like humans drive with their eyes. A Waymo exec disagrees with the comparison.",
    "fullText": "If people can drive with their eyes, can an AI drive only with cameras?\n\nTesla leans on that analogy to defend its hotly debated cameras-only approach to autonomous cars.\n\n\"It should be solved with cameras just like how every other human or animal lives around this world,\" Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of AI, said at the ScaledML Conference on January 29. \"Self-driving problem is thought of as a sensor problem. It's actually not a sensor problem, it's an AI problem.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo has a fundamentally different engineering approach to autonomy. Srikanth Thirumalai, Waymo's vice president of onboard software, pushed back on Elluswamy's comparison.\n\n\"I think the bar is higher than human driving,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe contrast between Waymo and Tesla goes beyond philosophy and is built into the hardware.\n\nTesla wants to reach autonomy with fewer than 10 cameras and an AI trained on billions of miles of real-world driving data. Waymo also relies on AI, but is paired with a multi-sensor system — 29 cameras, five lidars, and six radars — to give the AI driver different ways to perceive an environment. The Alphabet company has so far deployed about 2,500 robotaxis across multiple US cities.\n\nThe debate often boils down to cost and safety: More sensors could increase costs, which could be a barrier to scale. Fewer sensors could present safety challenges, some say, which is another constraint for mass robotaxi adoption.\n\nThirumalai manages a team of more than 600 people building Waymo's AI driver software. During a rare interview at Waymo's HQ, which spans multiple buildings, the vice president told Business Insider he expects the sensor suite to shrink over time as the hardware improves and gets cheaper. But he framed the lidar or no-lidar debate as a distraction from the company's safety-oriented objective.\n\n\"Given where the technology is right now, the question is what is it going to take for that product to be safe?\" he said. \"So you work backwards from that safety bar and say, 'What does it take to build a safe product?' And then keep pushing and iterating and innovating to reduce the cost of the sensors, and to improve the quality of the software and how it uses the sensors.\"\n\nThe soft-spoken Thirumalai looked to the future and explained his position.\n\n\"In three to five years, will our sensor stack look different than it is right now? Absolutely.\"\n\nWaymo has previously said it expects the next generation of robotaxis to have fewer sensors: 13 cameras, four lidars, and six radars. A Waymo spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company expects to serve public riders by late 2026.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHumans can be bad drivers. They're easily distracted, swayed by emotions, and can be slow to make the right decisions. Leaders in autonomy will say they're driven by a mission to build something safer than humans. The challenge is defining what \"safer\" means in a way that regulators, riders, and engineers can measure.\n\n\"This notion of what the bar is is a very important question,\" Thirumalai said. \"And one that we have only refined over the years, and in some cases, we're still sort of discovering what the bar is.\"\n\nInstead of an arbitrary goalpost that says robots will be multiple times safer than a human driver, Thirumalai said Waymo looks at individual driving cases and assesses how often those events can occur.\n\n\"We break it down and say, 'Well, how often do those events actually occur per million miles of driving? And how serious are those events?\" he said, adding that his team can then aim for a lower incident rate.\n\nThirumalai and even Waymo's top brass aren't selling perfection. A human fatality caused by a robotaxi isn't a matter of if but when, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana has said.\n\nReports and videos shared across social media have shown that AVs can make mistakes, whether in school zones, emergency response scenes, bad weather, or even seemingly ordinary driving scenarios.\n\n\"People might say, 'Hey, look, this is AI. We never want it to make a mistake.' That is an unachievable bar,\" Thirumalai said.",

If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla is only a few months away from its planned Roadster demo, and it might be getting a fresh new logo to boot.\n\nThe automaker filed two new trademark applications on Tuesday with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One of the filings shows a sleek design featuring three minimalist lines that appear to form a vehicle.\n\nThe second application is for the styling of the name. The company submitted protections for \"Roadster\" in an all-caps styling with a stretched shape and segmented letters.\n\nPer both filings, the logos haven't yet been used on commercial vehicles.\n\nTrademark attorney Josh Gerben wrote in a blog post that companies often file trademark applications on an \"intent to use basis\" ahead of a public launch.\n\n\"By filing early, Tesla locks in a nationwide priority date, preventing third parties from attempting to register the same or confusingly similar marks after the logos are publicly announced,\" he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe electric-car maker ramped up work on the Roadster last summer, Business Insider previously reported. Designs for the Roadster that were seen by insiders last year showed a two-seater with butterfly doors. At the time, a source with knowledge of the issue said the vehicle was at least two to three years from production.\n\nElon Musk has hyped up the revamped Roadster over the past few months. He has said the vehicle will be able to fly.\n\nIn a January interview, Musk said \"if safety is your number one goal, don't buy the Roadster,\" adding that it would be the \"best of the last of the human-driven cars.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO said during the company's third-quarter earnings call that the new Roadster will be unveiled on April 1, joking that April Fools' Day will give him \"some deniability.\"\n\n\"I could say I was just kidding,\" he said.\n\nHe had previously said Tesla planned to unveil the vehicle by the end of 2025.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Senate lawmakers questioned executives from Tesla and Waymo, and grilled Waymo's chief safety officer over Chinese cars and foreign workers.",
    "fullText": "What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo.\n\nLawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing.\n\nAfter autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña.\n\n\"You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker.\n\nPeña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a \"backdoor\" to sidestep the federal \"connected vehicle\" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.\n\nUnder US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect.\n\nWaymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch last month that it will rename the Zeekr robotaxi to Ojai, citing concerns that the US public may be unfamiliar with the Zeekr brand.\n\nPeña said the Chinese-made cars have \"no connectivity\" and that the driving system is installed in the US. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient.\n\nMoreno wasn't buying it. \"Giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans? That's completely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nOn overseas labor, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Waymo's use of remote human operators in countries outside the US \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nPeña said that while some operators are located in the US, others work abroad, including in the Philippines. These operators typically step in when robotaxis encounter unusual situations.\n\n\"Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue,\" Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react \"in a split second\" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas.\n\nMarkey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Waymo and Tesla executives framed autonomous vehicles as a race the US cannot afford to lose.\n\nWaymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast.\n\n\"We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles,\" Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a \"fragmented landscape of state regulations\" that slows investment and limits access.\n\n\"For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry's ability to innovate,\" said Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, referring to autonomous vehicle technology.\n\n\"Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements,\" he added.\n\nIndustry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he said in September.",

These trims ⁠have become a key ‌part of Tesla's 2026 strategy, lowering entry prices to attract more cost-conscious buyers without waiting ‍for a new mass-market vehicle.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla's \"Standard\" variants bring prices closer to pre-federal incentive levels, helping offset higher effective purchase costs.\n\nIn ​other markets, the trims cut roughly $5,000, a more visible ‌reduction aimed at boosting demand amid heightened competition.\n\nThe broader EV market has also cooled since September, when the Trump administration ended the $7,500 federal tax credits. Tesla, meanwhile, is facing intensifying global competition.\n\nAnalysts have warned that a greater share ⁠of lower-priced vehicles could keep pressure ​on margins unless Tesla can offset ​the impact through reduced manufacturing costs or stronger revenue from software and services.\n\nSeparately, CEO Elon Musk ‍said last week ⁠that the carmaker would end production for its Model S and Model X sedans, and instead use ⁠the space in its California factory to make humanoid robots.",

    "fullText": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can \nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nMany investors have danced around a growing debate on Tesla (TSLA) and its stock for the better part of two years.\n\nShould Elon Musk's EV creation be viewed as a car company anymore? Or, should it be viewed as a pure tech play whose future will depend on humanoid robots, robotaxis, and advanced chip manufacturing?\n\nAn argument could be made that Tesla's outsized valuation already reflects the view that the company is not an automaker. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 196 times is more tech growth stock oriented than the single-digit multiples seen at traditional automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford (F).\n\nBut I am here today to officially call it.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, 2026, I believe Tesla should no longer be viewed as an automaker. Stop sweating these monthly delivery reports, which will suck for 2026, as they did in 2025.\n\nIn fact, I think it's reasonable to assume that in under three years, Tesla will no longer make cars and SUVs for passengers.\n\nI can see the company making Tesla semitrucks and maybe a few bespoke iterations of the new Roadster for rich people.\n\nUsing Yahoo Scout AI (below), you can see the main drivers of Tesla's future valuation will be way different than how it derived value in the past.\n\nThe entire company will be humanoid production, robotaxi production, energy production, chipmaking, and whatever else Musk cooks up that ties back to high-margin software.\n\nWhere does this call come from? The tea leaves Musk dropped this week on his earnings call.\n\nNow, let me say this: I loved the more emotional Musk on the Tesla earnings call, loved that he thinks we are entering an age of amazing abundance, and appreciated that he got sad when talking about scrapping the Model S and Model X to cut costs and use their factory lines to make those aforementioned humanoid robots.\n\nMaybe the Cybertruck should be next — who doesn't hate trying to park a car next to one of those monsters?\n\nSo why did investors like the quarter in which total deliveries tanked 16%? Because people don’t want electric cars?\n\nHe told us Tesla is about to embark on a major — potentially more lucrative — reinvention:\n\nHe changed the mission statement of the company to \"amazing abundance.\" He started the call off with this one.\n\nHe said he wants to build chips out of something called a TerraFab. It will cost billions to do this, but Tesla supporters see this as an ultimate bullish long-term indicator.\n\nHe is scrapping the Model S and X to build robots.\n\nThis is the year of the robotaxi production ramp.\n\nI didn't hear anything about new Tesla models for passenger ownership, though he dropped the company is looking to debut the new Roadster in April.",

    "description": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful...",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful work in its factories right now.\n\nThis is a striking admission, given that Musk has spent the past two years claiming the opposite.\n\nLet’s take a walk through memory lane.\n\nJune 2024: Tesla’s official account claimed the company had “2 Optimus bots performing tasks in the factory autonomously.”\n\nJune 2024: At Tesla’s shareholder meeting, Musk said he expected “a thousand to a couple thousand robots working in its factories” by 2025.\n\nJanuary 2025: On Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk raised the stakes even higher:\n\n“The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year.”\n\n“Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I’m confident they will do useful things.”\n\nToday (January 2026): Musk admitted that no Optimus robots are currently doing useful work in Tesla’s factories.\n\n“Well, we are still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase. We have had Optimus do some basic tasks in the factory. But as we iterate on new versions of Optimus, we deprecate the old versions. It’s not in usage in our factories in a material way. It’s more so that the robot can learn. We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably the end of this year.”\n\nThis follows a now-familiar pattern with Musk’s predictions.\n\nWe documented last month that Tesla never came close to producing thousands of Optimus robots in 2025. There was no evidence of even hundreds being built.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Musk was specifically asked about how many Optimus robots Tesla has, and he didn’t answer.\n\nWhat Tesla has demonstrated publicly are robots performing simple tasks like handing out water bottles, and even then, they relied heavily on teleoperation (humans remotely controlling the robots) rather than true autonomy.\n\nMultiple supply chain reports throughout 2025 indicated that Tesla’s Optimus program was in “shambles,” with the head of the program departing and production being delayed.\n\nIn today’s shareholder update, Tesla did mention progress on Optimus:\n\n“In Q1 of this year, we plan to unveil the Gen 3 version of Optimus, which will include major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design. The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production.”\n\nTesla also said it’s preparing production lines with “start of production planned before the end of 2026 and eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots per year.”\n\nBut the admission that no robots are currently doing useful work directly contradicts years of claims from both Musk and Tesla’s official communications.\n\nI want to be clear: I’m actually bullish on humanoid robots. The technology is advancing rapidly, and Tesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nBut Tesla is running full speed ($20 billion capex worth) into the same problem it had with autonomous vehicles: it builds the hardware before the software is ready.\n\nOn top of this, even though I’m bullish on humanoid (to a degree, I’m not saying its a multi-trillion dollar industry), I don’t really trust Musk leading this effort with this real credibility problem.\n\nWhen Musk claimed in January 2025 that “several thousand Optimus robots will be doing useful things by the end of the year,” he wasn’t making a long-term prediction about uncertain technology. He was making a near-term operational claim about his own company.\n\nTesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nFred, I'm gonna need a source on this. For all we know, Musk just claims to have an advantage. I'm guessing those other companies which have been building robots for decades may have a better handle on some of this stuff.\n\nNow, a year later, he’s admitting that the number is zero.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla claimed had Optimus robots were doing “real work” in factories almost two years ago now.\n\nIt’s fairly clear for anyone who has been following the program closely that Tesla is still years away from a useful product that will be able to perform work at an efficient level beyond just demos.\n\nEven Musk appeared to somewhat admits that he the first part of his response where he said that the robot is “still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase.”",

    "description": "The five companies led by Elon Musk have increasingly become intertwined, even before Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI or merger chatter.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is running some of the world's most valuable companies. But they've been doing business with each other long before recent merger chatter around Elon Inc.\n\nThe billionaire leads five major companies: Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, which recently absorbed his social media company, X.\n\nOver the last three years, those companies have stepped up their internal dealings, buying one another's products, exchanging software and materials, and announcing investments worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe result is a tightly knit corporate ecosystem with Musk at its center.\n\nFor consumers and Tesla's many fans, that kind of vertical integration can look like a strength. Musk has argued that closer ties between his companies make them more resilient to geopolitical risk and supply-chain shocks.\n\n\"Done correctly, inter-company connections make a lot of sense,\" Lou Whiteman, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"The important thing is to ensure good governance is in place, so that, for example, Boring is paying a fair price for Tesla vehicles.\"\n\nOther analysts and investors say the arrangement concentrates too much power in Musk's hands. Tesla's eight-member board includes longtime allies of the billionaire — including his brother.\n\nNone of Musk's companies responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere are some of the recent sharing agreements, purchases, and investments between Musk's companies:\n\nMusk has repeatedly drawn on employees from one company to support others in his portfolio.\n\nIn 2022, about a month after Musk bought Twitter — now known as X — he sent roughly 50 Tesla employees to the social-media company's headquarters to help overhaul its code-review systems, according to court filings.\n\nMusk later argued in court that the Tesla employees had \"volunteered\" to do the work and that their temporary reassignment should not concern Tesla's board.\n\nExecutives share overlapping functions on several of Musk's companies, too, according to insider org charts obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor example, Charlie Kuehmann, the vice president of materials and engineering at Tesla, also holds the same title at SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX is a major customer of Tesla's energy business, purchasing batteries for robotics power and Megapack energy-storage systems.\n\nIt also reportedly invested $2 billion into xAI as a part of a previous funding round.\n\nMusk has also said that Tesla's long-awaited next-generation Roadster will be a \"Tesla/SpaceX collab\" and feature SpaceX-built cold-gas thrusters. The hyper-powered sports car's launch event is penciled in for April 1.\n\n\"It's gonna be really cool, and it's gonna have some rocket technology in it,\" Musk also said during a 2024 sit-down with Don Lemon.\n\nPerhaps the most public example of Musk's companies coordinating is Tesla's vehicle sales to his tunnel-building start-up.\n\nThe Boring Company, which operates tunnels in Las Vegas and Texas, uses fleets of Tesla vehicles to transport passengers through its underground systems. The tunnel builder has also constructed tunnels around Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.\n\nIt isn't alone. SpaceX also purchased an unspecified number of Musk's Cybertrucks.\n\nTesla's earnings on Wednesday disclosed that it had agree to invest $2 billion in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup, with a related \"framework agreement\" to explore additional collaboration opportunities.\n\nTesla has already integrated xAI's Grok into its vehicles, allowing drivers to chat with the AI and use it to add and edit navigation destinations.\n\nVideos have shown early versions of Tesla's in-development Optimus robot using xAI's Grok AI chatbot for its voice.\n\nElon’s Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer! Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1\n\nxAI has also reportedly told investors that it's working on AI that could power Tesla's forthcoming Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nTesla executives said the $2 billion investment supports the automaker's push into self-driving technology. For example, the earnings deck explained that xAI-developed software will analyze vehicle interiors and assist with route planning, including adding high-occupancy-vehicle lanes when the car is full.\n\nFor xAI, the investment adds capital to the cash-hungry buildout of data centers and their energy needs.\n\nThe deal marked one of the clearest examples of capital flowing from Musk's public company into a privately held firm he controls.\n\nThe growing web of internal deals has fueled discussion among investors and analysts about whether Musk's companies are evolving into something closer to a single, vertically integrated enterprise.\n\nThere's also been recent reports that some of Musk's companies could merge — including potential combinations of Tesla and xAI or SpaceX and xAI.\n\nWhiteman said many Tesla investors appear comfortable with that direction.\n\n\"In Tesla's case, an important factor to consider is that investors are buying into Elon Musk's vision for the future as much as they are buying into an automaker or clean energy company,\" he said.\n\n\"Since this group of companies, public and private, combine to represent Elon Musk's full vision of the future, I'd bet that many investors are happy to see Tesla involved in all aspects of 'Elon Inc.'\"",

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Pivot – Why Tesla Is Killing Its ‘Cheap Car’ to Build a Robot Army",
    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "title": "Here's what a potential SpaceX mega-merger could mean for Elon Musk's business empire",
    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame compared Elon Musk to Thomas Edison, but called the Tesla and SpaceX CEO a \"desperately incentivized futurist.\"",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Elon Musk is a true visionary — but the future he's building is much further away than he thinks.\n\n\"Elon is an American treasure but also a desperately incentivized futurist even earlier than me,\" the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame posted on X late Thursday.\n\nBurry, known for making premature but ultimately correct predictions, likely meant the Tesla and SpaceX CEO stands to profit enormously from his vision becoming reality, so he's highly motivated to hype it as much as he can.\n\n\"I am glad he is here in America,\" Burry wrote on his Substack. \"He will go down in history like PT Barnum and Thomas Edison,\" he added, referring to the legendary showman and founder of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and the iconic inventor who helped refine the electric light bulb.\n\nFuturists are \"always decades early, even earlier than I am,\" Burry continued. \"And since they sell self-evident futures with indefinite timelines, they can raise capital.\"\n\nBurry attached a link to an article about Musk reportedly exploring a merger between SpaceX and either or both of his other main companies, Tesla and xAI.\n\nSpaceX was valued at $800 billion in a private share sale in December, Tesla has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization, and xAI was valued at $230 billion in a November fundraising round.\n\nBurry said it \"did not take a futurist to know this was coming,\" and the market had already priced in a potential combination. He added that $1.6 trillion \"more than encompasses\" what the trio are worth today, even accounting for their future value.\n\nThe value investor, who recently shifted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, wrote that Tesla was \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a December post. He also warned that Musk's $1 trillion pay package would continue to dilute the company's shares.\n\nThat historic compensation deal underpins why Musk is so driven to market his vision and work toward realizing it. He's required to hit several milestones by 2035 to receive the full share allotment; those include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion, delivering 1 million robots, and bringing 1 million robotaxis into commercial service.\n\nAs for Musk's grand vision, he's repeatedly said he intends for humanity to colonize Mars in his lifetime. Moreover, he recently recommended people not save for retirement in 10 or 20 years, as he expects advances in AI, energy, and robotics to generate so many resources for all that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nBurry has butted heads with Musk over the years. In 2021, he took aim at Tesla for its reliance on government subsidies and Musk for paring his stake in the EV maker.\n\nMusk responded by writing: \"Burry is a broken clock.\" He also teased Burry in 2022 about his previous short bet against Tesla.\n\nMusk hasn't responded to any of Burry's recent X posts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla is giving the Model S and Model X the ax. Recent sales figures help explain why.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is taking its Model S and Model X to pasture.\n\nThe automaker will end production of the $94,990 sedan and $99,990 SUV next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nBased on recent delivery numbers, the decision isn't particularly surprising.\n\nTesla does not break out Model S and Model X sales individually; instead, it groups them with the Cybertruck under \"other models.\" Still, earnings presentations suggest demand for the category has been declining for years.\n\nIn 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 \"other model\" units worldwide — accounting for just over 3% of the automaker's 1,636,129 sales.\n\nThe \"other model\" figures are also down sharply from prior years. Tesla sold 85,133 vehicles in the category in 2024 — the first full year of Cybertruck deliveries.\n\nThat means sales fell about 40% in 2025, far steeper than the roughly 7% declines for the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nThe soon-to-be-discontinued cars will remain an important part of Tesla's history. The Model S, launched in 2012, was the automaker's first car built from the ground up. The Model X came three years later, giving the company a foothold in America's best-selling vehicle category, the SUV.\n\nThe Model X has faced reliability issues from the jump. The car's sweeping gullwing doors were difficult to mass assemble, Musk said, calling the vehicle a \"Fabergé egg\" during a 2019 earnings call.\n\nAnd while Tesla refreshed much of its lineup in 2025, the Model S and Model X received comparatively modest design updates — a contrast with the more aggressive changes to the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nInstead of chasing a revival of the aging car's sales, Tesla said it is discontinuing the program's production in favor of its Optimus humanoid robot. Musk projects building one million bots a year.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, adding that the decision was \"slightly sad.\"\n\nThe move underscores how far Tesla has shifted away from its legacy luxury models as growth slows and Musk pushes the company toward robotics and autonomy.\n\nStill, analysts aren't fully sold on the idea that Tesla's manufacturing switch-up will lead to immediate profits or sales results.\n\n\"The company appears to be on track with the rollout of Robotaxi service in nine US cities, alongside the start of production for the Cybercab and Semi,\" Steve Man, the senior auto industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider. \"But we believe a commercially ready Optimus robot remains at least a couple of years away.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "title": "I'm trying to guess why Elon Musk wants to mash SpaceX into xAI — or Tesla. I'm stumped.",
    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "description": "In its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Tesla said fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Everything is going great over at Tesla. Wait, sorry, no. Everything is going bad over at Tesla. The automaker held its quarterly earnings call on Thursday, announcing that fourth-quarter profits were down by 61% year-over-year, and annual profit cratered by 46% in 2025. Beyond posting its lowest profits in years, Tesla's revenue from car sales was down 11% year-over-year, and it was the second year in a row that sales declined.\n\nIt gets worse. As reported by TechCrunch, on the call, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla is killing off the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. This isn't exactly a surprise, as the two EVs are Tesla's oldest models, with the Model S launching in 2012 and the Model X following three years later. It's been years since either have been strong sellers; while Tesla no longer breaks out their sales, in 2025 it delivered 50,850 units of the Cybertruck, Model S and Model X combined (a 40.2% decrease compared to 2024), with the latter two likely making up 30,000 of those. Honestly, this should've happened a long time ago, ideally followed by next-generation versions of both, but that was never gonna happen. Instead, Tesla gave both models a couple of enshittifying facelifts over the past few years, the most recent of which came just a few months ago.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said on the call, \"so if you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\" The last units of both cars will be built at some point next quarter. Musk said their discontinuation \"is slightly sad.\" Boo hoo. He added that Tesla will support Model S and Model X owners \"for as long as people have the vehicles,\" whatever that means.\n\nTaking their place on the assembly lines of Tesla's Fremont, California, factory will allegedly be the Optimus robot. As The Verge reports, Musk said the \"mass production\" version of the Optimus will be shown later this quarter, and the first one will allegedly be built before the end of the year. We've heard how those promises usually turn out. Previously, Musk has said he aims for Tesla to build a million of them per year. Uh huh. He's also focused on getting the Tesla Cybercab out. We're not holding our breath for that one, either.\n\nPutting everything else Tesla and Elon-related aside, it is a shame to see the Model S get snuffed out like this. It did revolutionize the car industry, and while newer versions have been suckier, the early years of the Model S were truly great. Too bad their creator is focused on making the automotive world, and the world as a whole, a worse place.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy posted his \"notes from Claude Coding,\" describing a shift in engineering over the last two months.",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding.\" Now, he sees a \"phase shift\" in software engineering.\n\nAndrej Karpathy is one of AI's guiding figures. He was a founding member of OpenAI and later served as Tesla's director of AI. He also coined the term \"vibe coding,\" the AI-assisted coding movement that has taken software engineering by storm and was named Collins Dictionary's word of the year.\n\nIn his \"random notes from Claude Coding\" — which are over 1,000 words long — Karpathy wrote about the changes to his own coding style. Posted on X on Monday, the notes have already elicited reactions from engineers at Anthropic, xAI, and more.\n\nAI coding agents \"crossed some kind of threshold of coherence around December 2025 and caused a phase shift in software engineering,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nA few random notes from claude coding quite a bit last few weeks.\n\nCoding workflow. Given the latest lift in LLM coding capability, like many others I rapidly went from about 80% manual+autocomplete coding and 20% agents in November to 80% agent coding and 20% edits+touchups in…\n\nKarpathy name-dropped both Anthropic's Claude Code and OpenAI's Codex as having significant improvements. Claude Opus 4.5, the model that has garnered much love from engineers online, came out at the tail end of November.\n\nThe AI leader's workflow has changed as a result of the AI tools. From November to December, Karpathy's 80/20 ratio flipped. He once used 80% manual coding and 20% agents; now, it's 80% agents and 20% manual code editing.\n\n\"I really am mostly programming in English now, a bit sheepishly telling the LLM what code to write... in words,\" he wrote.\n\nThe change to AI-written code \"hurts the ego,\" but is too powerful to ignore, Karpathy wrote. He also devoted a whole section of his notes to the \"fun\" he has while coding with large language models.\n\nWhat of those traditional coding skills, the ones you learn in a computer science program or through endless digital courses? That's a whole other function, Karpathy wrote, and one that might decline.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" he wrote.\n\nIn Karpathy's comments, engineers from leading AI companies sounded off. Ethan He, an xAI engineer and Nvidia alum, wrote that a \"10x engineer can be a one-man army.\"\n\nCharles Weill, another xAI engineer, wrote that founders can now \"divide themselves\" with coding agents, like a VC divides their capital over a portfolio of companies.\n\nBoris Cherny, an Anthropic staffer and the creator of Claude Code, wrote that he read Karpathy's \"thoughtful\" post till its end.\n\nThe Claude Code team at Anthropic may offer a model of where the industry is moving, Cherny wrote. His team is \"mostly generalists\" and filled with 10x engineers.\n\n\"Pretty much 100% of our code is written by Claude Code,\" Cherny wrote. \"For me personally it has been 100% for two+ months now, I don't even make small edits by hand.\"\n\nThe Anthropic employee also acknowledged the \"quality\" problems with AI-written code. Agents can overcomplicate things and can leave around dead code, he wrote.\n\nHis solution: having AI review the AI-written code.",

    "description": "It turns out investors are willing to forgive huge capital spending if a company's core business is thriving.",
    "fullText": "Heading into Wednesday's hoy trinity of earnings — which saw Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla report within five minutes of each other — everyone knew that updates on AI progress would be the only game in town.\n\nHow those results ended up playing out shed crucial light on where we are in the AI trade right now.\n\nThe overarching focus for the Big Tech trio was not who has immediately seen results from AI investment. Instead, it was whether those companies were doing enough to support the appearance of maybe, eventually doing something. Investors love the prospect of future upside, and want a reason to preserve their optimism.\n\nEach of the three companies showcased this trend in their own unique way. Let's go one by one:\n\nLast quarter, Meta was punished for its capex-spending plans. This quarter, the company once again blew the doors off spending forecasts … but this time the market seemed OK with it.\n\nWhat changed? Look no further than the company's stronger-than-expected first-quarter revenue, driven by a big beat in advertising. Meta CFO Susan Li also got investors hyped on the earnings call by saying the company will fund its AI ambitions primarily with cash, rather than debt.\n\nIn the end, it's not that Meta has tangible proof that its AI spending is going to generate monstrous future earnings growth. The company has instead fallen back on its cash-cow advertising business to alleviate financing pressures and buy itself more time.\n\nWe haven't yet gotten an answer about whether the AI spending will pay off. We just know the company can afford to keep pursuing it.\n\nMarket reception: Very positive\n\nI present the counterpoint to Meta's well-received quarter. Microsoft also announced much larger-than-expected spending plans … and its stock fell.\n\nThe difference? One of Microsoft's main cash cows — its Azure cloud-computing unit — showed slowing growth. Suddenly, big spending doesn't look so appealing when your backstop is weakening.\n\nWhile Tesla's AI push has taken the form of self-driving vehicles and robotics, the company's lofty valuation is still being largely driven by hopes that big AI-linked profits will one day be unlocked.\n\nBut unlike Meta, the EV-maker is doing it at a time when its core business is in decline. One overlooked highlight of Tesla's report was that — even though the company posted a bottom-line beat — it also saw first-ever decline in annual revenue.\n\nIt didn't matter. Investors instead focused on Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI, the company owned by Elon Musk. They also seemed to take the discontinuation of the Model S and Y vehicles in stride.\n\nAgain, the perception of eventually monetizing AI won out. In the AI race, it's not what you're doing, it's what you can convince everyone you're going to do down the line.",

    "description": "Hiking subscriptions, making robots, and selling fewer cars? Tesla is acting like a tech company in more ways than one.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has long insisted Tesla isn't a car company. After its latest earnings, it looks less like one than ever.\n\nThe billionaire told investors that Tesla would scrap its Model S and X EVs and convert their production lines to build the company's Optimus humanoid robot, as it continues to shift toward AI and robotics.\n\nTesla also said it had agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI and to evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with Musk's AI startup.\n\nIt came as the company's financial disclosures painted a stark picture of the troubles facing its EV business, which saw sales decline for the second year in a row in 2025.\n\nTesla beat Wall Street's expectations, but reported its first-ever decline in annual revenue and said profits fell by 46% last year, while revenue from car sales fell by 11% year-over-year in the last quarter.\n\nExecutives largely shrugged off the headwinds, with Musk and other top employees reiterating in the analyst Q&A their belief that autonomous vehicles will shortly render traditional forms of transport obsolete.\n\n\"The vast majority of miles traveled will be autonomous in the future,\" said Musk, in response to an investor question asking about Tesla's plans to launch new models.\n\n\"I'm just guessing, but probably less than 5% of miles driven will be where somebody's actually driving the car themselves in the future, maybe as low as 1%,\" he added.\n\nInvestors reacted positively, with Tesla shares rising around 3% after hours following earnings.\n\nThe reaction is another sign of how, for many investors, vehicle sales have become a sidenote to Tesla's future, as the company executes an ambitious shift toward a new business model built on robotics, AI, and software services.\n\n\"They're definitely moving away from an automotive-oriented company to a tech-oriented company,\" Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told Business Insider prior to Tesla's earnings. '\"This is a company that's looking to get away from vehicle sales as the focus of their revenue.\"\n\nElon Musk has long said that Tesla should be thought of as an AI and robotics company, not a carmaker. Investors have agreed, driving Tesla's market cap to $1.35 trillion, more than every other US carmaker combined.\n\nEven before Tesla's latest AI-focused earnings, there were signs that the company had begun to act more like the tech giant Musk dreams of.\n\nThe company overhauled its autonomy offerings in recent weeks, removing the option to buy its premium Full Self-Driving software for a one-off fee of $8,000 and making it subscription-only.\n\nTesla also killed its basic Autopilot tier, which previously came free on almost all its vehicles, instead replacing it with a more limited form of cruise control. Musk also indicated in a post on X that Tesla owners can expect FSD prices to rise beyond the $99-per-month subscription fee as the technology improves.\n\nPhasing out free features and hiking subscription prices is classic tech giant behavior, and the moves quickly sparked backlash from Tesla fans and customers on social media. Analysts told Business Insider the changes were likely aimed at driving adoption of FSD and monetizing the existing user base.\n\n\"I think it's about monetizing FSD. I think they're going to look at more ways to monetize what I view as services, autonomous, and really disruptive technology within their installments,\" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities and a longtime Tesla Bull, told Business Insider ahead of earnings.\n\nMusk has described FSD as crucial to Tesla's future, but the company has struggled to get drivers to pay for it. In October, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja told investors that just 12% of Tesla owners have bought FSD.\n\nOn Wednesday, Taneja said that 1.1 million customers had bought FSD, but added that nearly 70% of those purchases were upfront rather than subscription.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key milestone for Musk's $1 trillion pay package, which requires the company to hit 10 million active FSD subscriptions by 2035 for the Tesla CEO to unlock the full payout.\n\nThe most critical part of Tesla's transition to a tech company is its robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot initiatives, which Musk has said will eventually make Tesla the world's most valuable company.\n\nTom Narayan, lead equity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Business Insider that nearly 75% of his long-term valuation of the company was based on robotics and autonomous vehicles, with just 8% coming from car sales. Ives put that figure at 80-90%, adding that he viewed Tesla as an \"autonomous and robotics company\" moving forward.\n\n\"That's why this is such a key transition year for Musk and Tesla. Any delays in autonomous or robotaxis are going to be heavily scrutinized because that's the key to the valuation,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla launched its robotaxi service in Austin last June, and recently began offering some public rides without a safety driver. However, its service in the Texan city is still small, with around 50 active vehicles, according to a community tracker run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna.\n\nMusk said on Wednesday that Tesla would have robotaxis operating in \"somewhere between a quarter and half\" of the US by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval, and the company is set to begin production on its dedicated Cybercab robotaxi in April.\n\nIves added that Tesla's focus this year would be on building out its robotaxi service, noting he didn't expect the company to begin collecting \"meaningful revenue\" from autonomous ride-hailing until 2027.\n\n\"It's important that they get into what I believe will probably be roughly about 30 cities this year. 2026 is the build-out of robotaxis, 2027 is where you'll start to see more monetization,\" Ives said.\n\nOnce Tesla's robotaxi service reaches escape velocity, Narayan said he expects it to transform the company's business model from a traditional carmaker into a high-margin services business more akin to Uber.\n\n\"It dramatically transforms the current auto business, which is a capital-intensive, low-margin business, into a high-margin, much higher revenue business,\" he said. \"The market is bigger and the economics are far better.\"\n\nExecuting that transition will be expensive. Taneja, Tesla's CFO, said on Wednesday that the company expects to spend more than $20 billion this year on new production lines and AI compute infrastructure.\n\nFor Tesla's beleaguered EV business, things look unlikely to improve anytime soon.\n\nAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the electric vehicle market in the US, the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September has caused that market to slow dramatically, with rivals Ford and GM canceling electric models and taking billions of dollars in charges amid warnings of an EV winter.\n\nOutside of the US, Tesla is losing market share to Chinese carmakers such as BYD, which now dominate China's booming EV market and are growing rapidly in Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nAutoForecast Solutions' Fiorani said that Tesla ran the risk of a bumpy transition period if its carmaking business declined faster than its robotaxi and services businesses could grow. However, he added that the company may have no choice but to make the leap.\n\nHe pointed to the competition from China and declining income from the regulatory credits that Tesla sells to automakers who have failed to sell enough EVs as evidence that the company's automotive business was running out of road.\n\n\"Musk sees the future of this business as robots and autonomous vehicles,\" Fiorani said.\n\n\"The physical products themselves, the cars and the automotive side, are all legacy products,\" he added. \"We're going to see them going forward to autonomous software, autonomous hardware, things that will move them into the next generation.\"",

    "title": "Tesla takes another leap toward becoming a physical AI company: Here are the 6 biggest takeaways from its Q4 earnings call.",
    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a $2B investment into xAI and the discontinuation of Model S and Model X in order to support Optimus robot production.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is making another leap to shed its EV maker title and transform into a full-fledged physical AI outfit.\n\nThe theme of Wednesday's fourth-quarter earnings call heavily centered on how Tesla is investing in its future as an AI and robotics company — a narrative CEO Elon Musk has pushed for some time now.\n\nThe bets included: a major investment in Musk's xAI, updates on the Optimus humanoid robot, and a renewed push for in-house chipmaking. Musk projected that Tesla's future will require a $20 billion investment, which dwarfs the company's $8.5 billion in capex reported for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's automotive segment took a back seat: Musk said he's killing the Model S and Model X to free up room for humanoid robot production. And while Tesla's energy and \"services\" revenue jumped 25% and 18%, respectively, auto revenue fell 11% year-over-year — a clear indication that the quarter's growth came from everywhere but its core EV business.\n\n\"We've updated the Tesla mission to amazing abundance, and this is an attempt to send a message of optimism about the future,\" Musk said during the call.\n\nThe company's stock rose 1.7% after the market closed on Wednesday evening.\n\nHere are 6 biggest takeaways from the earnings call.\n\nTesla made good on its pledge to investors and announced a $2 billion investment into xAI, the startup behind Grok. It's part of a larger $20 billion Series E funding round from January.\n\nThe expectation of the investment is a deeper collaboration between the two companies. xAI, which has been expanding its data center footprint, could provide the compute and other technical capabilities to further advance Tesla's autonomous vehicle and robotics agenda.\n\nVaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said during the call that the agreement with xAI is in the spirit of finding \"efficient ways for others to help us.\"\n\nIn a surprise move, Musk announced that production of the Model S and Model X would be discontinued by the next quarter, closing a chapter on the company's premium SUV and sedan.\n\nThat leaves the EV maker with four cars: the Cybertruck, the more popular Model 3 and Model Y, and the yet-to-be-released Cybercab.\n\nThe CEO said during the call that the move will provide more production space in Tesla's Fremont factory for Optimus robots.\n\nThe \"long-term goal\" is to produce a million units a year with the freed-up space, Musk said.\n\nThe CEO added that killing the Model S and Model X is part of Tesla's \"overall shift to an autonomous future,\" which includes the company's ride-hailing service, Tesla Robotaxi, and autonomy in personally owned vehicles through Full Self-Driving, an advanced driver assistance system.\n\nTesla expects to start production of the Cybercab, a two-seater coupe, in April for eventual integration into its Robotaxi fleet.\n\nTesla revealed where it aims to expand the Robotaxi ride-hailing service in the first half of 2026 — Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas — but has yet to announce when it will remove the safety monitors inside the cars for public riders across Austin and San Francisco Bay Area, where the service now operates.\n\nMusk said that FSD — the technology that Tesla says will make personally owned vehicles fully autonomous — is already \"100% unsupervised\" and operating without humans inside. The difference, he said, is that Tesla is being \"very cautious\" with rolling out unsupervised service to the public, though Tesla began offering a limited number of unsupervised rides in Austin this month.\n\n\"There's like some pretty nutty intersections, where there are a lot of humans who make mistakes and have accidents in various cities,\" Musk said. \"So we want to make sure that FSD can handle those unusual intersections.\"\n\nThere wasn't much of a progress report on Tesla's AI5 chip, but the CEO said he's spending part of his weekends working on it.\n\n\"If I'm spending my Saturdays on something, it's going to be something pretty important,\" Musk said, adding that chip procurement is \"existential\" for Tesla's future, going so far as to bring up the Tesla \"Terafab\" — his aspirational idea of building an in-house chip manufacturing plant.\n\nMusk said he wants to build a factory that integrates \"logic, memory, and packaging\" because Tesla will be \"fundamentally limited by supply chain\" if it doesn't.\n\nMusk said he expects to unveil an Optimus 3 robot in a \"few months,\" but don't expect it to be working the assembly lines just yet.\n\nThe CEO said Optimus isn't contributing to Tesla's manufacturing work in any \"material way\" and that the humanoid robot is only in the factory for training purposes.\n\nMusk talked a lot about Tesla's future, but the company's fourth-quarter performance still hinged on its tangible businesses, such as its energy segment, which includes the Megapack, a utility-scale battery system, and the Powerwall, the home battery system.\n\n\"On the energy front, we achieved yet another record in terms of gross profits for the quarter and ended the year with nearly $12.8 billion in revenue,\" Taneja, the Tesla CFO, said.\n\nTesla also announced this month that it will pivot FSD to a subscription-based only model starting in February. Customers previously had the option to buy FSD upfront for $8,000.\n\nThe move is a clear signal that Tesla sees FSD as a key future revenue generator.\n\nAutomakers are increasingly betting that software subscription services will be a critical source of recurring revenue with higher margins. General Motors revealed that its vehicle software generated $2 billion in the past nine months.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

Tesla also announced it plans to release the third generation of its Optimus robot later this quarter.\n\nThe Model S and Model X are some of Tesla's oldest models, as well as its priciest.\n\nTesla unveiled a prototype for the Model S, a sedan, in 2009 and began deliveries to customers in 2012. The Model X, an SUV, was announced in 2012, with first deliveries going out in 2015.\n\nBoth models received upgrades in 2025, including an increase in driving range, better noise cancellation, and smoother suspension, as well as a price increase of $4,500. However, the upgrades did not include some of the more innovative technologies that were introduced with Tesla's Cybertruck.\n\nThe starting price on Tesla's site for the Model S was $94,990 as of Wednesday, or $109,990 for the more premium Plaid version.

    "description": "Waymo robotaxi is closing the gap on pricing and wait times next to Uber and Lyft — key metrics riders factor in when choosing a ride, a study found.",
    "fullText": "Waymo's robotaxis are getting more competitive with Uber and Lyft as the autonomous vehicle service closes the gap on pricing and wait times in San Francisco, while Tesla undercuts everyone on price, a first-ever study comparing all four platforms showed.\n\nObi, a ride-hailing price aggregator, on Tuesday published a study that provides a snapshot into the state of the ride-hailing competition in the San Francisco Bay Area, a major hub for autonomous vehicles and traditional ride-hailing services.\n\nWaymo's robotaxi service is not only closing the price gap with Uber and Lyft but also competing better on wait times; both factors — price and long ETAs — were among the highest-cited issues consumers had with ride-hailing companies in general, according to a survey Obi conducted as part of the study.\n\nObi's June 2025 study on Waymo found prices 30% to 40% higher than those of Uber and Lyft. This latest report, conducted between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, shows Waymo is now an \"average of 12.7% more expensive than an Uber and 27.3% more expensive than a Lyft.\"\n\nWaymo also appears to be competing better on wait times with the two ride-hailing giants, according to the study. Over a 24-hour period, Obi's data showed that Waymo's ETAs better matched Uber's and Lyft's, except at peak demand times around 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., when Waymo's wait times spiked.\n\nWaymo's average ETA was 5.74 minutes, whereas Lyft's was 5.14 minutes, and Uber's was 3.15 minutes.\n\n\"That's the biggest change to me,\" Ashwini Anburajan, CEO of Obi, told Business Insider. \"It's the convergence in price as well as the reduced wait times because now you can actually compare them. It's a more honest comparison between the three platforms.\"\n\nObi's report also looked at Tesla Robotaxi, the newest entrant in the Bay Area's ride-hailing market, and found that it had the longest wait times by far, with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. However, the study found that it beat every competitor on pricing.\n\n\"Obi's data shows that the price for a Tesla robotaxi ride in San Francisco rarely exceeds $10, averaging $8.17 vs. the next cheapest option, Lyft, which averages $15.47,\" the report said. \"That's a staggering $7.30 average price variance.\"\n\nAnburajan told Business Insider that Tesla's pricing is reminiscent of Uber and Lyft in the early days.\n\n\"They're using the playbook that Uber and Lyft used when they first came into the market — dramatically lower pricing, undercutting what's existing in the market, and really just driving adoption, driving downloads, driving people to use the app,\" Anburajan said. \"And we know that playbook works.\"\n\nFor the Obi CEO, Tesla's wait times are the difference between a nascent service and a serious ride-hailing competitor.\n\n\"I don't think people realize how critical wait times are in selecting a robotaxi or a regular rideshare,\" Anburajan said. \"They're a huge factor in how people decide.\"\n\nAn Uber spokesperson declined to comment. Spokespeople for Lyft, Waymo, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nObi's findings are a snapshot from a limited window, as prices and wait times can swing with seasonality. Still, the study captures how the Bay Area market is shifting: Tesla is buying demand with lower fares, while Waymo is increasingly looking less like a premium service and more like a viable substitute for Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe data on Waymo tracks with the company's recent expansion in November, when the company increased its robotaxi fleet from 800 cars to more than 1,000.\n\nObi's survey suggests consumer attitudes on autonomous vehicles are changing, too. Nearly half, or 48.3%, of respondents said they expect autonomous vehicles to be their main rideshare — up from 24% in June.\n\n\"I think that the novelty of riding a robotaxi or an autonomous vehicle has started to wear off in the San Francisco market, and I think that's a good thing,\" Anburjan said. \"More people trust the cars now.\"",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

    "fullText": "An incident that underscores both the promise and the growing pains of EV (electric vehicle) ownership just played out on camera. A Tesla driver’s routine stop at a public charging station turned into a frustrating episode, and the moment was immortalized on vehicle security cameras.\n\nThe story, first shared by the owner on the Reddit forum r/TeslaModelY, quickly spread through EV and automotive circles, lighting debates over charging-station security, equipment vulnerability, and even the readiness of public infrastructure for mass EV adoption.\n\nWe recently reported an emerging trend of EV charger thefts, targeted for their copper, and costing charging stations hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacement costs.\n\nIn this story, the owner reported plugging in at a public charger and stepping away for roughly 30 minutes — only to return and find that a critical charging accessory had been stolen. The item taken was a J1772 adapter, an essential piece of hardware that allows Tesla drivers to connect to non-Tesla charging stations.\n\nBeyond the theft itself, what made this more than just a petty theft story was how the incident was captured. The Tesla’s built-in surveillance, a combination of Sentry Mode and external cameras designed to protect the vehicle, recorded the interaction.\n\nAnd that’s how the owner and others in the EV community could see exactly what happened. The video showed a woman approaching the car and removing the adapter — an act that, until now, many drivers assumed would be deterred by Tesla’s lock-in features that secure charging ports.\n\nIn follow-up comments, the Tesla owner explained that they were unaware the locking feature had not been enabled. Unfortunately, that small oversight came with significant consequence. After sharing the footage, the owner managed to locate and recover the adapter, and plans to enable the lock feature on future visits.\n\nNot merely a quirky footnote in the life of a Tesla owner, this story reflects broader stresses in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem.\n\nA sustained EV proliferation will sustain increasing demand for public charging infrastructure. Early adopters often praise the environmental benefits and futuristic tech of EVs, but incidents like this, however seemingly inconsequential, can further undermine confidence in the reliability and security of the charging network. This is especially the case with cautious EV converts still on the fence.\n\nCharging stations, especially those maintained by third-party providers or local councils, are typically unmanned and scattered across public spaces such as shopping centers, highway rest stops, and municipal lots. Unlike a fuel pump at a gas station — where attendants, lighting, and surveillance have evolved over decades — EV chargers are still figuring out the human and security infrastructure needed to go with the hardware.\n\nThis gap has proven to make them ripe targets for theft, vandalism, and misuse. It used to be that the main complaint was about EV owners who treat charging stations as car-sitters; now people have to worry about their chargers being targets for thieves.\n\nTeslas are famous for their advanced camera systems and a mode called Sentry Mode, which uses the car’s exterior cameras to monitor and record suspicious activity around the car when left unattended.\n\nOriginally designed to combat vandalism and break-ins, Sentry Mode has, over the years, captured everything from graffiti attacks to attempted thefts. It has proven a powerful tool for owners and, in some cases, law enforcement.\n\nYet this very bounty of data raises questions deeper than whether thieves might target an adapter. As more incidents are recorded and shared online, concerns about privacy, data usage, and surveillance are surfacing in tandem.\n\nCameras ‘catch’ a thief snatching a charger, and people suddenly remember that Tesla and other automakers amass enormous amounts of footage and sensor data that, while invaluable in cases of vandalism or accident reconstruction, could also be mishandled or misused.\n\nAn insurer says they’re cutting prices in half for cars running FSD (Tesla’s full self-driving technology), and we’re wondering what that means for driving data being shared with an insurance provider. That tension has already drawn scrutiny and criticism from privacy advocates.\n\nGirl stole my J1772 adapter\nbyu/uglah inTeslaModelY\n\nThere are several key takeaways for the average Tesla or EV owner:\n\nEnable all available security features — including charging port locks and Sentry Mode — to deter theft and protect equipment.\n\nBe aware of the surrounding environment when using public chargers; well-lit, high-traffic areas will always be safer.\n\nRecord and share incidents responsibly — community vigilance helps highlight weaknesses in public infrastructure and encourages operators to step up security.\n\nThis episode offers a snapshot of an industry in transition. A growing EV adoption will expose gaps in charging security, public awareness, and infrastructure readiness. It’s normal, and stories like this, amplified by social media and the built-in cameras of the vehicles themselves, help reveal how advanced driver-owned tech has become and how imperfect the human and civic systems around it still are.",

    "fullText": "Tech chiefs waxed poetic about AI to delegates at Davos. Plus, the ‘human’ drama of AI startups and why Tesla is thriving in Texas\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. This week’s edition is a team effort: my colleague Heather Stewart reports on the plans for AI’s world domination at Davos; I examine how huge investments have followed AI companies with little to their names but drama and dreams; and Nick Robins-Early spotlights how lax regulation of autonomous driving in Texas allowed Tesla to thrive.\n\nWhen they weren’t discussing Donald Trump, delegates at the World Economic Forum last week were being dazzled by the prospects for artificial intelligence.\n\nUp and down the main street of the Swiss Alps town, almost every shopfront was temporarily emblazoned with the neon slogan of a tech firm – or a consultancy promising to tell executives how to incorporate AI into their business. Cloudflare’s wood-panelled HQ urged delegates to “connect, protect and build together”, and Wipro’s shouted: “Dream Solve Prove Repeat.”\n\nAt the conference, tech CEOs laid out their hopes for how the physical manifestations of AI will blanket the world in the coming years. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told a rapt audience about how “token factories”, as he calls datacenters, will have to be distributed across the world, to diffuse the benefits of AI globally.\n\n“To me, a long term, scalable solution is to have all of these token factories part of the real economy connected to the grid, connected to the telco network – and that’s what will drive that scale, whether it’s in the global south, or in the developed world,” Nadella said.\n\nMeanwhile Google was showing off the latest iteration of its Google Glasses to excited delegates; and there were endless sessions in the Davos congress centre about the technology’s potential benefits – including a breathless chat with late addition to the schedule Elon Musk, though with the SpaceX IPO apparently looming, he was keenest to talk about going to Mars.\n\nAway from the glitzy shopfronts, though, there was significant concern being expressed that all this proves to be an epic bubble.\n\nIn an interview with the Financial Times, DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis warned that some aspects of AI investment do look, “bubble-like”, but insisted that, “if the bubble bursts, we [ie Google, not society at large] will be fine”.\n\nNadella offered one test for how we would know if it is a bubble – which I didn’t find reassuring. “A tell-tale sign of this as a bubble, is if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” he said.\n\nMuch of Silicon Valley has been captivated over the past week by a “very human drama”, as the Wall Street Journal put it. Thinking Machines Lab, a startup founded by former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, fired her own chief technology officer, Barret Zoph, over a relationship with a colleague and a recent lack of productivity, per the Journal. Within hours, her ex-employee – along with one of her co-founders and a third employee – had reportedly signed offers with OpenAI, which they left just last year to join her startup. The three had told her they disagreed with the direction of the company in the meeting that ended with Zoph’s firing, according to the Journal. For his part, Zoph told the Journal that Murati had fired him simply for telling her he was considering another job.\n\nAs dishy as the drama might be, the stakes of Murati’s mess differ from a juicy celebrity entanglement that might be chronicled in TMZ or Page Six, two of my favorite publications. The stakes in San Francisco are billions of real dollars and more than $10bn potential ones. Murati’s company has raised $2bn in venture capital since its founding in February 2025. It is valued at $12bn. The talent involved in these California productions – not movies but rather AI tools used by hundreds of millions of people – takes on superstar significance.\n\nThinking Machines has released one product, Tinker, in October 2025, meant to streamline the customization of large language models, a rather niche concern in comparison with ChatGPT’s ambitions to replace Google search or Claude’s coding aptitude.\n\nThe massive investment and resulting valuation are chasing little in terms of real offerings from the company. A new company profiled in the New York Times last week, Humans&, has naught but a dream, an ugly website – and several hundred million dollars. Researchers from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk’s xAI, including one who helped develop the notorious Grok AI tool, founded the company just three months ago. They aim to facilitate collaboration between humans and machines rather than separation – “innovations in long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning, memory, and user understanding”, per the site. If that sounds gauzy, it is because the company has not launched a product.\n\nHumans& has raised $480m from Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, and Google, per the New York Times. It is valued at $4.48bn. It has – say it with me one more time – not launched a product.\n\nWhatever fears of an AI bubble may be circulating, the money is still flowing, chasing after the future with an enormous but uncertain bet in the present.\n\nElon Musk announced last week that Tesla had removed human safety monitors from its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, as the company moves to expand its autonomous vehicle business. As with most things Musk, the reality was a bit more complicated – Tesla’s vice-president of software later clarified on X that the company had deployed “a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors”.\n\nWhat Tesla’s test-run of fully driverless vehicles did highlight, however, was the difference between how much leeway Texas gives autonomous vehicles compared with California, the birthplace of autonomous driving in the US and the home of the highest number of self-driving cars in the country. The Texas department of motor vehicles does not have regulatory authority over autonomous vehicles in the state, instead autonomous vehicles are governed by the state’s transportation code. Although a new government authorization system for autonomous vehicles is set to be implemented in the coming months, there’s currently no application process required for autonomous vehicle operators in the state. \n\n “Autonomous vehicles on Texas roads are subject to all traffic laws and can be cited for safety violations, but do not yet require specific authorization to operate,” the Texas DMV said.\n\nAlso surprising is the state’s lack of regulations on operating an autonomous vehicle if it’s for personal, non-commercial use. As long as it complies with some stipulations, such as traffic laws and safety standards, an autonomous vehicle can drive around Texas without anyone in the car.\n\n “Any motor vehicle equipped with an automated driving system may operate in this state,” the Texas transportation code states. “An automated motor vehicle may operate in this state with the automated driving system engaged, regardless of whether a human driver is physically present in the automated motor vehicle.”\n\nMeanwhile in California, the state’s department of motor vehicles requires three stages of testing and permitting for commercial autonomous vehicles. Regulators are also in the process of considering new rules that could add even more requirements on vehicle operators. Tesla caused confusion last October when Musk announced a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, only for regulators to say that the company did not have authorization to operate paid or unpaid autonomous rides to the public. On the Robotaxi section of Tesla’s website, it only mentions Texas.",

    "description": "My front camera had problems with condensation, especially in direct, low sunlight. Tesla cleaned it, but this could be a challenge for full autonomy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla offered a free trial of its FSD system in December. I was driven autonomously for most of the month and came away with new insights.\n\nThe latest software was impressive, but my experience revealed a glaring problem that could hamper Tesla's path toward a full, unsupervised Robotaxi service.\n\nFirst, the good stuff. I have a Model 3 Performance with HW4 hardware. It doesn't have a camera near the front bumper, but otherwise it's modern hardware. I also have an up-to-date version of FSD.\n\nThis combination resulted in an amazing FSD experience. I drove from Silicon Valley to Lake Tahoe in supervised autonomous mode and had no issues. I drove into SF and back several times, trouble-free.\n\nI estimate 90% to 95% of my driving was in FSD mode during December. It's a new state of driving that I think is safer than human driving. I spend less time worrying about where I'm going and which turn to make. Instead, my eyes are on the road and my hands are ready near the wheel, just in case.\n\nDespite the ability to text while being driven now, I pay more attention to the road in FSD mode, not less.\n\nA surprise bonus: I argue (OK, debate!) less with my wife about directions when we are on FSD-powered trips together. There's no discussion about whether this or that route is better. FSD just does it. This reduces the potential for marital spats. That's probably worth the entire $100-a-month FSD subscription cost.\n\nWhen Tesla told me my month-long trial was ending, I was genuinely disappointed. Do I pay monthly now? No. But I don't drive enough at the moment. If my wife's or my commute becomes much longer, we would certainly pay.\n\nThis was all supervised autonomous driving. That means Tesla requires human owners to be at the wheel and alert at all times.\n\nUnsupervised autonomy is the next frontier. That's when cars drive themselves with no human at the wheel. Waymo already does this in Silicon Valley and a few other urban areas in the US. Tesla's Robotaxi service started doing this in Austin recently, but elsewhere, these Robotaxis still have safety drivers behind the wheel.\n\nMaking this leap is a huge feat. And Tesla is trying to do this with a purely camera-based system, while Waymo uses cameras, Lidar, and other sensors that are not just vision-based.\n\nThis is the big schism in the industry. Backers of the multi-sensor approach say their systems are better and safer because components such as Lidar collect data without \"seeing,\" so they work in more environments. However, this is more expensive than camera-only systems.\n\nTesla's approach is cheaper, so that's good for efficiently mass-producing millions of robotaxis, such as the upcoming Cybercab. But, can camera-only systems actually work as well in unsupervised situations?\n\nThis is where my December FSD experience sowed some seeds of doubt in my mind. To be clear, I'm not an expert. I'm a huge fan of my Tesla vehicle, and I hope both autonomous approaches work and make roads safer. Still, here's what happened last month.\n\nThe main front camera at the top of my windshield sometimes gets condensation, dust, or dirt inside the glass and plastic compartment.\n\nA couple of times, when I was in FSD mode and being driven into the low sun, I got a loud, red warning sign on the screen of my Tesla telling me to take over immediately or the system would pull over. I took the wheel quickly with no further issues and restarted FSD soon after.\n\nBut these incidents were slightly unsettling. My interpretation is that sunlight was streaming into the front camera compartment, and the glare was combining with condensation and/or dust to degrade the quality of the images being collected.\n\nA week or so later, I got an alert from Tesla to bring my vehicle in for a service. The goal was to clean the inside of the front camera. I set up an appointment, which the Tesla app told me would cost $60.\n\nI took it to a nearby Tesla location, and the cleaning lasted about an hour. Tesla didn't charge me. After that, I didn't get any red warning signs for the rest of December while using FSD.\n\nThis front camera is not easy to clean because it has a housing around it, which might also trap moisture that could otherwise dissipate more easily from the car's interior.\n\nIf Tesla wants its cars to be fully unsupervised Robotaxis, a front interior camera that fogs up and needs to be professionally cleaned seems like a potentially big problem. With a million Robotaxis on the road, how many times might Tesla service employees have to clean these cameras?\n\nThis also suggests that a multi-sensor approach — that doesn't 100% rely on cameras that need cleaning — might be a better way to attain full autonomy at scale.\n\nThere are signs that Tesla may already be responding to this issue, as it gets more experience running its Robotaxi service.\n\nIn September, Elon Musk wrote on X that keeping the front camera clean is \"a major area of focus.\"\n\nAbout a month later, the company rolled out a software update that enabled the windshield wipers to do extra wiping around the front camera. You can see it in action here. That only addressed exterior dirt and moisture, though.\n\nMore recently, Tesla Robotaxis have been spotted with new cleaning systems that squirt water onto the outside cameras to clean them.\n\nMore importantly, there's a new setup for the front camera behind the windshield, according to photos posted on X recently by Tesla investor and owner Sawyer Merritt.\n\n\"Black lines surrounding the entire front camera housing, which could mean improved sealing to prevent off-gassing inside the car from fogging the cameras, potentially eliminating the need for Tesla to perform front camera cleanings (just speculation),\" he wrote.\n\nAnother Tesla owner posted a photo this week of a new Model Y with an updated front camera housing.\n\nTesla also has a patent for a new way of preventing front camera glare, for use in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles.\n\n\"The glare shield features a textured surface composed of an array of micro-cones, or cone-shaped formations, which serve to scatter incident light in various directions, thereby reducing glare and improving camera vision,\" Tesla wrote in the patent filing.\n\nIt's unclear how well these fixes will work. But Tesla is obviously trying hard to address these challenges. Its camera-only approach depends on it.\n\nI asked Tesla and Elon Musk all about this on Monday in a detailed email. They didn't respond by publication time on Tuesday morning.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) removed its Autopilot basic self-driving software as a standard feature in the US on new Model Y and Model 3 purchases as the company pushes its more advanced FSD (full self-driving) subscriptions.\n\nPer Tesla’s website, new orders for Tesla’s entry-level models no longer offer Autopilot as a standard option, now only offering a Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, essentially an adaptive cruise control that allows the vehicle to change speeds when following another car on the highway.\n\nPreviously, Autopilot offered Traffic-Aware Cruise Control and auto-steer, which allowed the car to stay centered in its lane and change lanes using the turn signals.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Tesla removed Autopilot as it faced a suspension of its dealer license in California stemming from a ruling that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing over claims about Autopilot and FSD. The ruling was stayed for 60 days to allow Tesla time to comply, namely to change marketing practices around the software.\n\nThe change comes as Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last week the company would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for FSD, pushing instead to a monthly subscription offering of $99 per month, which was already an option.\n\nMusk said late Thursday night the price of FSD could rise as well.\n\n“I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve,” he said on X.com. “The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”\n\nPulling Autopilot from Tesla EVs is a notable move considering other automakers, including Toyota, offer such services as standard options in their vehicles. On the flip side, the move to focus on FSD may be the right one considering Autopilot was an older technology and, per Musk dictates, FSD was Tesla's autonomous future.\n\nInterestingly, one X.com user posited Tesla’s move to pull Autopilot was tied to Musk’s new compensation plan, one that required a milestone of 10 million paying FSD subscribers.\n\nYesterday, Tesla stock popped when Musk announced the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla appears to be getting closer to deploying Optimus in its factories — and Austin is the next training ground.\n\nTesla told workers during a town hall last week that it plans to begin collecting data to train its humanoid robot at its Austin Gigafactory, insiders told Business Insider.\n\nThe company is looking to train Optimus how to operate in the Texas facility, it said, adding that it was targeting a February start date.\n\nTesla has been collecting data and training Optimus prototypes in its Fremont, California, factory for more than a year.\n\nThe Optimus data collectors in Fremont are typically kept separate from the general factory workers to avoid interfering with output, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nThere, data collectors have recorded themselves organizing vehicle parts and working on conveyor belts, Business Insider previously reported. The videos are then used to teach Optimus how to mimic the same movements.\n\nCEO Elon Musk said during an interview at Davos on Thursday that Tesla has the humanoid robot doing \"simple tasks\" in its factory, though he didn't specify which.\n\n\"By the end of this year I think they'll be doing more complex tasks but still deployed in an industrial environment,\" he said. \"By the end of next year I think we'll be selling humanoid robots to the public.\"\n\nHe warned earlier this week in a post on X that production of Optimus — and the company's Cybercab, which will be produced in Austin — will be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla has been sharing sneak peeks of Optimus' capabilities since the product was first announced in 2021. In 2024, the automaker posted a video that showed the robot arranging batteries while tied to an overhead support structure at the company's lab in Palo Alto. The company said that it deployed two autonomous Optimus robots in one of its factories in 2024.\n\nTesla employs several dozen Optimus trainers. The company's factory workers, who number in the thousands, could be an ideal group to help train the robot due to their expertise and workforce size.\n\nLast year, Tesla moved from primarily training the robot using teleoperation to collecting video data — a strategy that could help the carmaker rapidly collect larger amounts of data without the constraints of motion capture suits, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nTesla's Optimus trainers are outfitted with large helmets with cameras that point in several directions. The helmet is attached to a heavy backpack, which can be unwieldy at times. Tesla has experimented with a lighter fanny pack setup, but it's unclear if the company plans to use it in factory data collection, people with knowledge of the program said.\n\nMusk has pitched Optimus as the \"biggest product of all time.\" He's said the humanoid robot could be the solution to everything from housework and factory work to operating data centers in outer space.\n\nThe town hall also covered non-Optimus developments. The company is working on updating several production lines and construction will continue to be ongoing at the factory.\n\nOver the past year, the carmaker has repeatedly slashed production hours for its Cybertruck line and moved workers to the Model Y line amid lackluster sales numbers for the electric pickup truck.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "Online insurance firm Lemonade said it would offer a policy designed specifically for self-driving cars, starting with Tesla.",
    "fullText": "Tesla's car sales may have struggled recently, but Morgan Stanley says a recent update in the insurance space is a positive signal for the real bull case for Tesla stock: autonomous driving.\n\nOnline insurance provider Lemonade announced the launch of a new product for self-driving cars this week. The Lemonade Autonomous Car insurance will begin with a 50% rate cut for Tesla drivers when their vehicle's autonomous driving software is in control.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts say this is a \"critical unlock\" for Tesla and the broader self-driving car market. It indicates that insurance providers may finally be gaining confidence in autonomous technology.\n\nOne of the largest hurdles to autonomous driving has been insurance providers' reluctance. High uncertainty regarding liability and risk has prompted many companies to avoid insuring vehicles with autonomous capabilities.\n\nLemonade's decision to start ensuring Tesla vehicles equipped with the tech might mark a breakthrough, Morgan Stanley said.\n\n\"This is an important shift in how insurers treat advanced driver-assistance and autonomy features,\" he said. \"Lemonade's approach suggests growing confidence in the data coming from Tesla's fleet, using real-world driving outcomes to assess safety performance rather than relying solely on theoretical or regulatory classifications.\"\n\nWhile Lemonade's announcement is specific to Tesla cars for now, the EV leader is seen as a bellwether for the autonomous driving industry. Percoco added that he expects more companies to follow Lemonade and start insuring self-driving cars.\n\n\"Lemonade's announcement points toward a future in which insurance becomes one of the clearest market-based validators of autonomous driving progress,\" he wrote.\n\nWith Tesla's electric vehicle sales down for two consecutive years, Elon Musk is betting big on autonomous driving, and investors see the technology as the primary justification for the stock's premium valuation. More accessible insurance could hasten the adoption of autonomous driving tech.\n\n\"As insurers incorporate increasingly granular driving data into pricing, technologies that demonstrably reduce risk should be rewarded faster and more transparently,\" he noted. \"For Tesla, this marks another step toward external recognition that FSD is moving from an experimental feature to an economically relevant safety system.\"",

    "title": "Tesla Has Dropped This Basic Autopilot Feature, Forcing US Drivers Into Subscriptions",
    "description": "Other brands will continue to offer similar features at no extra cost.",
    "fullText": "If you're in the market for a new Tesla, your fancy new electric car is going to be a little less smart—unless you pony up for a subscription. According to reporting from Elektrek and buying experiences from drivers, the company is ditching the basic Autopilot mode that used to come standard in new vehicles, and is now pushing buyers to \n\nBefore, Autopilot consisted of two minor but helpful driving assist features. The first was Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which automatically adjusts speed based on the speed limit and surrounding cars, and the second was Autosteer, which helps keep you in the center of your lane. The idea was that, while highway driving, you could turn on Autopilot and essentially let your car drive itself (while still remaining attentive and aware, of course).\n\nNow, though, Autosteer will only be available as part of a Full Self-Driving, or FSD, subscription. Traffic Aware Cruise Control will still come standard on new vehicles, but highway drivers who aren't paying Tesla a monthly fee will now need to make tiny corrections every once in a while to keep from veering into the wrong lane.\n\nMaking its cars dumber by default is an odd move for a company that wants to be seen as cutting-edge, although if removing Autopilot encourages more FSD subscriptions, that would see more users with Tesla's most-advanced self-driving tech on the road. Unfortunately, that goal will be pretty costly for consumers. A Full Self-Driving subscription currently costs $99 per month, although until Feb. 14, you are able to buy a lifetime FSD subscription for $8,000.\n\nWhich features you'd get with an FSD sub depends on what's legally available in your area, but in addition to bringing back Autosteer, upgrading could also net you assistance with parking, pickups, and lane changes. However, if all you want is to get your basic functionality back, disgruntled drivers are pointing out that the discontinued features continue to be offered standard on lower-cost models from competing brands, like Toyota.\n\nThe move to push Full Self-Driving subscriptions also comes alongside a promise from Tesla owner Elon Musk that pricing for the feature will go up as it improves, although the statement seemed to mostly focus on hopes of a future unsupervised FSD mode rather than more minor upgrades.\n\nAt any rate, it's getting more expensive to buy a Tesla that lives up to the futuristic dreams the marketing promises. The company does still offer a slightly less expensive $6,000 \"Enhanced Autopilot\" add-on in some international regions, which combines the features from basic Autopilot with a few FSD features, but North American customers will now have no choice but to subscribe.",

    "description": "The company is also currently facing a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in California for deceptive marketing about Autopilot's capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Tesla has discontinued Autopilot, its basic driver-assistance system, as the company tries to boost adoption of a more advanced version of the technology that it calls Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\n\nThe decision comes as the company faces a 30-day suspension of its manufacturing and dealer licenses in its largest U.S. market, California. A judge ruled in December that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing by overstating the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD for years. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, which originally brought the case and has a say over the licenses, stayed the ruling for 60 days to allow Tesla to comply by dropping the Autopilot name.\n\nAutopilot was a combination of Traffic Aware Cruise Control, which sticks to a designated speed while maintaining distance with cars ahead, and Autosteer, a lane-centering feature that could steer the car around curves.\n\nTesla’s online configuration site now states new cars now come standard with only Traffic Aware Cruise Control. It’s not clear if current customers are affected.\n\nThe decision comes one week after the company said that starting on February 14, it would stop charging a one-time $8,000 fee for the FSD software. After that, customers will only be able to access FSD through a monthly subscription of $99 — though Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on Thursday that the subscription price will increase as the software’s capabilities improve.\n\nMusk believes that Tesla’s newer cars will be capable of “unsupervised” driving, saying FSD advances will allow drivers to “be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride.” In December, he said a new version of FSD allowed the former, though texting while driving is illegal in almost all states.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla rolled out the first robotaxi versions of its Model Y SUVs in Austin, Texas, that have no human safety personnel in the cars. Those vehicles are running a more advanced version of the company’s driving software and are still followed by the company’s cars for supervision.\n\nTesla launched the beta version of its Full Self-Driving software in late 2020, but adoption has always lagged behind the expectations of executives like Musk. In October 2025, Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said only 12% of all Tesla customers had paid for the software. Hitting “10 million active FSD subscriptions” by 2035 is one of the key “product goals” required for Musk to receive the full payout of his new $1 trillion pay package. \n\nTesla first introduced Autopilot in the early 2010s after talks broke down between Musk and Google to leverage the tech being developed by the search giant’s then-nascent autonomous driving division (which eventually got spun out into Waymo). Tesla made the driver-assistance system standard on all of its vehicles in April 2019.\n\nAcross the decade-plus of Autopilot’s existence, Tesla struggled with communicating the software’s capabilities. The company often overpromised and made the tech seem more capable than it was, leading some drivers to become overly confident in its abilities, which in turn led to hundreds of crashes and at least 13 fatalities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",

I really enjoyed his talk at Davos and found what he said on humanoid robots quite interesting.\n\nMy prediction is there'll be there'll be more robots than people. Probably sometime next year. I'd say that by the by the end of next year, I I think uh we'd be selling humanoid robots uh to the public.\n\nA new Gartner report this week sheds light on what's coming on the humanoid front potentially. Through 2028, uh less than 100 companies will progress humanoid robot proofs of concept beyond experimentation with fewer than 20 companies going live in production for supply chain and manufacturing use cases. My question is this, should we believe humanoids will be the next great investment opportunity. After all, there is an AI component to these bots. Stephanie, what say you?\n\nAh, it's from a personal perspective, it's a little bit scary. I have to say, but um, it is something that we have been considering in Robin Hood strategies, for example, where we haven't necessarily been looking for companies to invest in that have humanoids in their, uh, you know, in their pipeline, but we have been investing in companies that will provide the eyes and the ears for robots because even if it doesn't end up being a humanoid, I do think this concept of automation replacing humans in some way shape\n\nor form is not going away. That's going to be a growing concept. Um, and so that's where we've been focusing.\n\nAnd as I don't know why I think this, but I think you'd be an earlier uh an early adopter of one of these humanoids in your house.\n\nI would definitely be an earlier adopter.\n\nSee, I know. See, you work with someone long enough, you kind of just know, you know.\n\nMaybe for the yard. But not right now. Oh, for sure, for for everything in the house. Uh, yeah, can the humanoid clean? Oh, sure.\n\nAnd your Costco pizzas. It can make those Costco pizzas for you.\n\nCan can they cook for me? Yeah, of course. Uh I'd be a huge early adopter for humanoid robots and also the robot taxis as well. Uh but look, this year and next year and going forward, it is uh we are starting to see sort of the merging of machinery which has been around, but also now you're adding on the AI layer, the intelligence layer. And that is what's most exciting when talking about humanoid robots in in the future.\n\nAll right, so I got it right with Ines. Brooke, I'm going to guess that you're a little skeptical on the on these humanoids.\n\nBrian, I'm the youngest here and I'm skeptical. I don't think I'd want one of these in my house.\n\nYeah, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.\n\nI think certainly for sure, when when you think about uh the future where this is going. Elon Musk is pretty convincing. He was saying that a lot of his parent- a lot of his friends rather have elderly parents. This was in the conversation at Davos with Larry Fink. A lot of his uh friends have elderly parents and he believes that these humanoid robots will help to take care of an aging population. I thought that was an interesting point. I personally, I love interpersonal relationships. I love, you know, talking to people. I love being the one to sort of\n\njump in. And so I I will say, I'm not bought yet, but if this is anything like uh how Disney Channel's uh The Smart House went, then we're in for something certainly that might be a little scary here. And so, I'm a bit skeptical here, Brian.\n\nAll right, well I will leave it on this. I know my mom is a big opening bid watcher each day. Mom, I will say this to you right to the camera. I'm going to buy one of these robots early to take care of you at some point because look, not to be mean, I I just don't have the time. Sorry mom.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk said Tesla will raise subscription prices for its Full Self-Driving software as it gets better, and it could cost more than $100.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said in an early Friday X post, \"I should also mention that the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD's capabilities improve.\"\n\n\"The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD),\" he said.\n\nTesla's FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that aims to enable its cars to be fully self-driving.\n\nCustomers can currently buy the system for $8,000 on a one-time basis, per the vehicle's listing on Tesla's website. However, this option will no longer be available from February 14.\n\nThe executive was responding to a post about Tesla killing its separate Autopilot service in the US.\n\nMost of Tesla's vehicles previously came with Autopilot as standard. The software included traffic-aware cruise control, which maintains a set driving speed and slows down automatically in response to traffic, as well as features like Autosteer, which allowed Tesla's cars to automatically follow lane markings.\n\nAs of Friday, Tesla now only offers Traffic-Aware Cruise Control as standard, according to the company's website.\n\nThe move attracted backlash from some Tesla fans on X, with several pointing out that rival brands like Toyota offer lane centering technology as standard on many models.\n\nIt comes as Tesla pushes to drive subscriptions for FSD, which Musk has described as a critical part of the company's future.\n\nAdoption of the technology has been sluggish, with Tesla's CFO telling investors in October that only around 12% of Tesla owners are paying for the assisted-driving feature.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a crucial part of Musk's massive Tesla pay package. Getting to 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions is one of the key milestones the Tesla CEO needs to hit to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nTesla currently makes it clear that FSD requires driver supervision. The company announced Thursday that it had begun offering fully autonomous rides without a safety monitor in its robotaxi service in Austin, and Musk has said that he expects \"unsupervised\" FSD to massively boost demand for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nThe automaker has faced regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits over its rollout of FSD and Autopilot. The US's auto regulator launched an investigation in October following reports that Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD were running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nRepresentatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

CEO Elon Musk and his most bullish investors believe that autonomy will help take Tesla's valuation to new heights.\n\nToday, FSD (Supervised), as the name suggests, is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that requires constant human supervision. The promise is to advance FSD enough to make the system unsupervised — meaning the driver behind the wheel can take their eyes off the road or even fall asleep. Tesla gave a glimpse of this future on Thursday, launching Robotaxi rides in Austin without a safety monitor in the vehicle.\n\nThe gap between what the tech can do and what it can't is where my experience landed.\n\nI recently demoed a 2025 Tesla Model 3 that came installed with FSD v14.2.1, the latest software version available at the time.\n\nWith my friend riding shotgun, I drove around the East Bay Area, taking the Model 3 through various road environments, including a university campus, parking lots, and the highway, on a clear Saturday afternoon.\n\nFSD proved to be a highly capable driver — so much so that it has spoiled me into wishing that I didn't have to constantly babysit the system.\n\nI drove the Model 3 for a few hours around Berkeley and Alameda. The drive was a little less than 100 miles through a wide range of driving conditions — highly dense urban streets, university roads, canyons, and the highway.\n\nOne was when FSD was cautious around pedestrians on Berkeley's campus. I recall a student who wasn't using the crosswalk but was close to it, walking across the road. FSD came to a rolling stop rather than an abrupt halt, which is exactly how I would've handled the situation.\n\nThe system also managed to navigate the university's roads and perform a three-point turn when I stopped the car and added a new destination.\n\nFSD's \"Mad Max\" mode is impressive in the way it lane-changed around a few cars that were moving too slowly on the highway for my taste. Calling it \"Mad Max\" feels a little gratuitous, but I appreciate that a more urgent driving mode is available.\n\nAt no point did I need to disengage FSD or question the system enough to take over the steering wheel. Tesla FSD is a smooth and cautious driver.\n\nMy friend, who doesn't actively follow tech news or everything Musk says as much as I do, described the experience like being in a \"spaceship.\" That wasn't necessarily a compliment from his end — he likes older cars — but it's exactly how Musk intended the Tesla experience to be.\n\nI gained enough trust in FSD that I wanted to test the system's limits by closing my eyes while driving down University Avenue — a fairly busy thoroughfare in Berkeley.\n\nThe car kept driving for a bit, but I was inevitably warned to pay attention to the road.\n\nAs good as FSD is, the technology doesn't allow you to completely disengage mentally. It was like having an itch that's just not quite fully satisfied. The technology is — or at least feels — so, so close.\n\nPeople who swear by FSD like to say that the system is a game changer, lifting the burden of driving off their shoulders.\n\nI agree that driving can be a tedious chore. I immediately think about the drive between San Francisco and Los Angeles that I do a few times a year. It's about 400 miles and can easily be a 7-hour drive depending on traffic.\n\nThe problem isn't that it's hard in a problem-solving sense. The drive is mostly a straight shot. The problem is that I have to stay awake. I can listen to music, put on an entertaining podcast, or get 200 mg of caffeine from a can of Celsius, but the drive is so monotonous that I could easily doze off while on the 5 highway.\n\nI obviously can't do that yet with Tesla FSD, which makes me wonder: How significant is the difference, really, between the cognitive effort it takes to manually drive from SF to LA than having to supervise an ADAS?\n\nFSD feels like the burden of driving was just shifted away from my hands and feet to my attention.\n\nMusk said an FSD (Supervised) is now capable enough for drivers to take their eyes off the road in certain conditions without triggering the warning system.\n\nThat would be useful only if Tesla were to take full responsibility when I get pulled over by the police.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nI'm likely spoiled because I know what full autonomy feels like.\n\nI have constant access to Waymo. I've filed an entire story inside a robotaxi and used it several times to take me home after a night of drinking.\n\nThat's the bar I want Tesla FSD to reach and exceed: a system capable enough to let me sleep behind the wheel on any road, meaning no geofences, and one in which Tesla will take accountability for any issues that arise while FSD is unsupervised.\n\nI'm also thinking about folks like David Moss, who said he broke a record for driving more than 11,000 miles on FSD without touching the steering wheel. Moss told me how FSD could be a life-changer for his father, who is legally blind and unable to drive. If Tesla's ADAS can reliably — and legally — put people like Moss' dad behind the wheel, I can see Full Self-Driving going from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have.\n\nTesla's decision to remove the safety monitor from some of its robotaxis suggests the company could be close.",

    "fullText": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said the company started robotaxi rides with no safety monitor present in the cars in Austin, a long-awaited move. This comes after Waymo announced another expansion of its robotaxi service in the US, hammering home its lead in the autonomous space — for now.\n\nMusk also claimed on Thursday that he expects the company’s self-driving service to get EU and China approval soon.\n\nTesla stock popped on the news, closing up over 4%.\n\nIn a post on X.com, Musk said Tesla \"started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\" This post came in response to users on X posting videos of the Tesla robotaxi operating without a safety driver.\n\nTesla AI head Ashok Elluswamy added on X.com that the service is \"starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Waymo, part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), said on its company blog that it is now operating in the Miami area, inviting its first public riders in the city. “With nearly 10,000 residents already signed up, we will be inviting new riders on a rolling basis to ensure a seamless experience across our initial 60-square-mile service area.”\n\nWaymo says plans for rides to Miami International Airport will be coming soon.\n\nBefore the Miami announcement, Waymo operated in five major US markets: Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the greater San Francisco area.\n\nThis year, Waymo has an aggressive plan to expand, with Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Nashville targeted for public service.\n\nIt also has plans for densely populated cities, with testing ongoing in New York, Tokyo, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla's autonomous and robotaxis services are lagging. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Musk claimed the company’s full self-driving (FSD) autonomous service, a supervised product that requires users to pay attention while using it, would soon be coming to Europe and China.\n\n\"We hope to ​get Supervised Full Self-Driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month, and then maybe a similar timing for China,\" Musk ‍said.\n\nWhile Waymo currently is only testing internationally in the cities mentioned above, its service is level 4 autonomous, which is fully autonomous in certain geographic areas. Tesla’s FSD is considered level 2.\n\nTesla’s robotaxis, currently operating in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, have grown in numbers but only modestly. The robotaxis still require a safety driver in each vehicle, owing to the fact that it is still a supervised service. The new video shared by Musk suggests the company has approval to operate without a safety driver in Austin, but the CEO didn't share whether that was the case.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to the stage at Davos in his first-ever World Economic Forum appearance, in which he revealed few new details.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk once called Davos \"boring af.\" After his first appearance, some attendees might agree with him.\n\nThe billionaire took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in a surprise appearance on Thursday for an interview that touched on many points of his sprawling business empire — but offered few new details.\n\nMusk has previously avoided the conference, and the Tesla CEO has in the past criticized Davos and its organizing body, the World Economic Forum.\n\nAnticipation was therefore high after Musk was unexpectedly added to the schedule on Thursday morning.\n\nInterviewed by Larry Fink, the BlackRock CEO and interim WEF cochair, Musk began by explaining Tesla's mission of \"abundance for all,\" largely reiterating comments he's previously made on X and in other interviews.\n\nThe world's richest man predicted that \"ubiquitous\" AI and robotics would lead to an unprecedented expansion of the global economy and ultimately render work obsolete, and predicted that \"AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively\" by 2030 or 2031.\n\n\"At a certain point, there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is there'll be more robots than people,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire did, however, share a more concrete timeline for Optimus: he expects Tesla to start selling the humanoid robots to the public by the end of next year.\n\nMusk didn't address Tesla's robotaxi rollout — another product critical to the company's future — beyond reiterating that he hoped to get approval for its Full Self-Driving technology in Europe and China next month. Investors are keen for details about when the company will remove human safety operators from its service in Austin and begin planned operations in several new US cities.\n\nMuch of the interview focused on space-based AI data centers, a topic that Musk and other Big Tech CEOs have discussed extensively in recent months.\n\nMusk told Fink that SpaceX would begin launching solar-powered AI satellites into space \"within a few years,\" adding that he expected space-based computing to largely solve the wrangling over the vast amounts of energy used to power AI back on earth.\n\n\"The net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be in space, and that'll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest,\" said Musk.\n\nThe SpaceX founder also touched on the longevity trend, saying that ageing was a \"solvable problem,\" but warned that society could \"lack vibrancy\" if humans were able to live forever.\n\nMusk ended his Davos debut with an appeal to optimism, a philosophical conclusion for someone who has previously used public appearances to attack his business rivals and issue eye-catching pronouncements.\n\n\"I think my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future,\" Musk said.\n\n\"Generally, I think for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and be wrong rather than be a pessimist and right,\" he added.",

    "fullText": "A Tesla owner took to Reddit to vent frustration after their vehicle's cameras captured a woman stealing a key charging accessory not long after the car was plugged in. While the incident ended without permanent loss, it highlights a growing concern around electric vehicles and charging station vandalism or theft.\n\nThe situation was shared in the r/TeslaModelY forum, and the owner said the theft took place \"30 min after [they] plugged in.\" They also shared a video.\n\nThe stolen item was a J1772 adapter, a small but essential piece of equipment for many Tesla drivers. The adapter allows Tesla vehicles to connect to non-Tesla EV charging stations, making it especially valuable for drivers who rely on public infrastructure.\n\nSeveral commenters noted that someone shouldn't have been able to steal the adapter due to Tesla's technology. According to the OP, they were unaware that Tesla vehicles have a locking feature that can secure the adapter while charging, preventing it from being removed by someone else.\n\nIncidents like this can discourage new drivers from adopting EVs, particularly those who have concerns about charging access, reliability, and security. If people fear that charging equipment can be easily damaged or stolen, it undermines confidence in the infrastructure needed to support wider EV adoption.\n\nThe hesitation is problematic because EVs play a crucial role in reducing reliance on gas and oil. Critics often argue that EVs can be just as polluting as internal combustion vehicles due to battery manufacturing or electricity generation. However, numerous studies show that even EVs charged on the dirtiest grids still produce less lifetime pollution than gas-powered cars.\n\nIn a follow-up comment, the owner shared a positive update: They managed to track down the woman and recover the adapter, adding that they plan to contact their local dealership to make sure the locking feature is enabled.\n\nAs EV ownership grows, addressing vandalism, educating drivers on built-in security features, and continuing to expand secure charging infrastructure will be key to ensuring cleaner transportation can scale effectively.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Tesla's Elon Musk is asking job applicants to share their biggest tech wins via three simple bullet points.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to see your results, not your résumé.\n\nThe Tesla CEO this week requested that people who want to work on the company's Dojo3 AI chip email three bullet points describing the \"toughest technical problems you've solved.\"\n\nMusk's just-the-facts approach, outlined in a post on X, reflects a focus on problem-solving over fancy résumés or cover letters.\n\n\"He's basically just trying to cut through the noise of the job market,\" said Michelle Volberg, a longtime recruiter who is the founder of Twill, a startup that pays tech workers to recommend peers for key jobs.\n\nShe said that résumés or LinkedIn profiles don't always make it clear to employers where a person's skills lie. Asking a job seeker to lay out a trio of battles won can help hiring managers get to the meat of someone's abilities, Volberg told Business Insider.\n\nIt's a way of thinking that she expects more employers will adopt.\n\n\"Elon is showing the way that the job market is going to go,\" she said.\n\nAlready, some tech companies are eager for job candidates to demonstrate their abilities by highlighting how they arrived at an answer. It's part of what appears to be a show-your-work ethos in Silicon Valley, where hefty spending on AI projects and a hangover from the pandemic-era staffing boom are driving hiring austerity in all but the hottest areas.\n\nVolberg said that hiring managers at large companies have told her that they're sick of relying on résumés so tailored to a job opening that they reveal little about candidates themselves. Asking job seekers to identify a small number of concrete problems they've solved can help overcome that challenge and help bring clarity for hiring managers, she said.\n\n\"They don't want to see fluffy résumés that have been written by ChatGPT,\" Volberg said.\n\nBullets over bona fides is, of course, a departure from the conventional approach of stuffing a résumé with bolded job titles, years of experience, and skills.\n\nAsking applicants to summarize the value they would bring by sharing vignettes of success can elevate technical accomplishment over pedigree or background, she said. It's an example of what some HR types call \"skills-based hiring.\"\n\nMusk's no-frills call for applicants appears to build on his prior statements about being open to candidates from nontraditional backgrounds. For years, the billionaire has said that people didn't need a college degree to work for Tesla. Musk has said that he's more focused on evidence of \"exceptional\" ability or achievement.\n\nHe also requested bullet points in 2025 when he oversaw efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency group to remake swaths of the US federal government. A nearly year-old post on X said that DOGE was seeking \"world-class\" software engineers, product managers, and data scientists, among other roles.\n\nAn application portal linked to the post contains a field instructing applicants to include two or three bullets \"showcasing exceptional ability,\" and to upload a résumé.\n\nVolberg said the bullet method is similar to guidance that her company already gives job seekers: Focus less on adjectives and more on outcomes.\n\nFrom a hiring manager's perspective, she said, the central question is whether a candidate can make their job easier by solving real problems.\n\nThe corollary, Volberg said, is fakers beware: \"If you say that you've solved these three things, you'd better be able to talk about them in detail.\"\n\nShe said that it's often immediately clear to tech recruiters whether someone has actually done the work they describe. Candidates who exaggerate or fabricate their accomplishments are likely to be found out — and potentially blacklisted, Volberg said.\n\nBeyond candidate chicanery, there could be other risks to Musk's strategy, said David Murray, CEO of Confirm, a San Francisco startup focused on reinventing performance reviews.\n\nAsking people to submit summaries of their greatest tech wins could mean that an employer like Tesla misses out on the quiet contributors and introverts who might not do as good a job promoting themselves, he told Business Insider. Bullets of key achievements — even more than with a typical résumé — require people to make the case for their own work.\n\nMurray said that Musk's approach also overlooks the impacts of the so-called Dunning-Kruger effect, in which people who aren't great at something tend to overestimate their abilities, and those who are ace might assume a task is easy for anyone.\n\n\"What he is asking people to do is to market themselves,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is bracing for another round of production hell.\n\nThe Tesla CEO said on Tuesday that the ramp-up of the company's Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus robot, both set to enter production this year, would be \"agonizingly slow.\"\n\n\"The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,\" wrote Musk in a post on X.\n\n\"For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast,\" he added.\n\nTesla is set to begin production of the Cybercab, a sleek two-seater robotaxi that Musk has said will ship without a steering wheel or pedals, in April. The billionaire is targeting an eventual production goal of 2 million units a year.\n\nThe Cybercab, which Musk said in 2024 would cost around $25,000, is set to enter mass production as Tesla races to expand its robotaxi service after a sluggish start.\n\nThe company launched autonomous ride-hailing in Austin last June, but it only has a small number of Model Y robotaxis on the road in the city and has not yet removed human safety monitors from its vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, Optimus, its humanoid robot designed to help with everyday tasks, is set to enter production by the end of 2026, with Musk saying Tesla could eventually make one million a year.\n\nThe Tesla CEO told investors in October that it would take a while to reach that goal as the company was having to manufacture almost the entire supply chain from scratch, with production moving at the speed of the \"slowest, dumbest, least lucky thing out of 10,000 unique items.\"\n\nMusk's comments echo what Tesla is telling its employees. In an all-hands meeting in October, the company's VP of AI software told staff on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus teams that 2026 would be the \"hardest year\" of their lives, Business Insider's Grace Kay exclusively reported.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Tesla has faced a rough road while scaling an ambitious new product.\n\nThe company endured a famously brutal period of what Musk called \"production hell\" while building its Model 3 EV in 2017. Musk and other employees resorted to sleeping on the factory floor as they struggled to scale the mass-market model.\n\nTesla also faced production challenges with the Cybertruck, the company's last new vehicle.\n\nThe electric pickup's unique design and stainless steel-clad structure made it highly challenging to produce at scale, and Musk acknowledged in 2023 that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" with the Cybertruck's design.\n\nThe divisive electric truck also serves as a caveat for Musk's ambitious production goals.\n\nMusk's predictions that Tesla could produce 250,000 Cybertrucks a year have fallen short, with industry data showing the company sold just over 20,000 Cybertrucks in the US last year.",

    "fullText": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk are at it again, with each of the tech titans taking aim at the other in a series of heated posts on X.\n\nMusk appeared to start the latest escalation early on Tuesday morning, when he posted \"Don't let your loved ones use ChatGPT\" in response to a post that said that use of OpenAI's chatbot had been linked to the deaths of nine children and adults since it was released in 2022.\n\nAltman fired back, first in defense of ChatGPT and OpenAI's desire to protect its users, and then blasting Tesla's Autopilot technology, calling it unsafe.\n\n\"It is genuinely hard; we need to protect vulnerable users, while also making sure our guardrails still allow all of our users to benefit from our tools,\" Altman said.\n\nAltman continued, calling out Autopilot.\n\n\"I only ever rode in a car using it once, some time ago, but my first thought was that it was far from a safe thing for Tesla to have released,\" he wrote. \"I won't even start on some of the Grok decisions.\"\n\nAltman added: \"You take 'every accusation is a confession' so far.\"\n\nThere have been at least eight wrongful-death lawsuits filed against OpenAI that allege use of ChatGPT has contributed to worsening mental health conditions, leading to instances of suicide and murder, including among children and young adults.\n\nSafety concerns around Tesla's self-driving technology have also been central to multiple wrongful-death lawsuits, including one surrounding a 2019 crash in Florida that left a 22-year-old woman dead. A jury determined Tesla was 33% liable for the crash and awarded the plaintiffs $329 million in total damages, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Altman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nThe social media feud comes as the pair is stuck in the middle of a long-running legal battle over OpenAI's status as a nonprofit company. Musk sued Altman, and other leaders of OpenAI, alleging that they misled him when they decided to pursue a for-profit structure, moving the company away from its original nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk said he donated $38 million to OpenAI when it was originally founded as a nonprofit.",

    "fullText": "Tesla boss clashed with Michael O’Leary when airline boss rejected installing Starlink technology on aircraft\n\nElon Musk has floated the idea of buying the budget airline Ryanair, escalating his public spat with the Irish carrier’s boss, Michael O’Leary.\n\nThe two outspoken businessmen have locked horns since last week, when O’Leary was asked whether he would follow Lufthansa and British Airways in installing Musk’s Starlink satellite internet technology on his fleet of 650 aircraft.\n\nThe Ryanair chief executive rejected the idea, saying that adding antennas to the jets would result in “2% fuel drag”, adding an extra $200m-$250m to its $5bn (£3.71bn) annual kerosene bill.\n\nMusk said that interpretation was “misinformed” in a post on his X platform, prompting a tit-for-tat exchange of insults, with each calling the other an “idiot” and then the Tesla and SpaceX CEO saying O’Leary should be fired.\n\nOn Friday, the world’s richest person asked his followers on X whether he should buy Europe’s biggest airline, which is valued at €30bn (£26bn), posting: “Should I buy Ryan Air and put someone whose actual name is Ryan in charge?”\n\nHe followed it up with a poll asking whether he should “Buy Ryan Air and restore Ryan as their rightful ruler”. More than three-quarters of the nearly 900,000 respondents said yes, three hours before the poll closed. Tony Ryan, the Irish billionaire businessman who co-founded the budget airline in 1984, died in 2007.\n\nRyanair’s X account also mocked Musk, posting in response to an X outage across the US last week: “Perhaps you need Wi-Fi @elonmusk?”\n\nMusk wrote in a reply to a post from the airline teasing him: “How much would it cost to buy you?”\n\nAll this may look like idle talk, but the billionaire has followed through on such threats before. In a social media exchange in 2017 he tweeted that he loved Twitter and when a journalist suggested he should buy it, Musk replied: “How much is it?” He bought the platform almost five years later in a $44bn deal, later renaming it X.\n\nHowever, movements in the airline’s share price on Tuesday suggested investors were not taking the idea of a takeover seriously, with Ryanair shares closing nearly 1% down.\n\nMusk was born in South Africa and, after a stint in Canada, now lives in the US. Airlines based in the EU must be majority-owned by EU nationals or citizens of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein under the bloc’s rules.\n\nThe row began when O’Leary spoke on Irish radio on Friday, telling an interviewer that he would take no notice of what the Tesla CEO had to say about installing wifi on Ryanair planes.\n\n“I would pay no attention whatsoever to Elon Musk,” he told Newstalk. “He’s an idiot. Very wealthy, but he’s still an idiot … What Elon Musk knows about flights and drag would be zero.”\n\nHe claimed that adding a Starlink antenna to every jet would push the fuel bill up by “an extra dollar for every passenger we fly and the reality for us is we can’t afford those costs. Passengers won’t pay for internet usage; if it’s free, they’ll use it – but they won’t pay one euro each to use the internet.”\n\nO’Leary, 64, also said he was “thankfully” too old to have any social media accounts.\n\nRyanair was contacted for comment.",

But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "title": "Woman Plugs In Tesla With 110 Miles of Charge at Wawa. Then It Immediately Dies, Locking Her In: ‘There Was No Air Circulating’",
    "description": "“Nothing was working. Not even the button to get out.”",
    "fullText": "Fast charging is supposed to add energy, not take it away. But for one Tesla Model Y owner, plugging in at a brand-new Wawa charger triggered an abrupt shutdown that left her asking how a car with plenty of range could suddenly go dark.\n\nIn a TikTok packed with guidance and warnings for Tesla owners, creator Emma Renee @the.emmarenee shares the details of her and her 15-year-old son becoming temporarily trapped in the car and then locked out, despite indications that it was charged for over 100 more miles of travel.\n\n“I literally plugged it up, had about 110 miles on it to drive, sat here for three seconds and it stated, ‘Vehicle power reduced. Powering down,\" she says in the clip. “Nothing was working. Not even the button to get out.”\n\nThe video quickly struck a nerve with EV owners, many of whom were confused by how a vehicle showing more than 100 miles of remaining range could abruptly lose power. As several commenters pointed out, the issue did not appear to involve the main high-voltage battery that powers the Tesla Model Y’s drivetrain, but rather the vehicle’s low-voltage electrical system.\n\nModern Teslas, like most electric vehicles, rely on a separate low-voltage battery—traditionally a 12-volt unit, though newer models have transitioned to lithium-ion systems—to operate essential functions such as door locks, infotainment screens, and control modules. If that system fails, the vehicle can become largely unresponsive even if the main battery pack is fully charged.\n\nIn her replies to commenters, Emma Renee said technicians at a Tesla service center later attributed the failure to a charging-port fault that shorted the low-voltage system, rather than a spontaneous battery failure.\n\nViewers quickly flooded the comments section with theories, many pointing to a familiar culprit. “12v battery needs replaced,” one commenter wrote, echoing dozens of similar responses. Others noted that internal combustion vehicles can also become disabled when their accessory batteries fail, though mechanical door handles typically remain operable in those cases.\n\nLow-voltage battery failures are a known issue across the automotive industry, and Tesla has acknowledged that earlier lead-acid units often need replacement after two to four years of service. In response, the automaker began rolling out lithium-ion low-voltage batteries in newer vehicles, including updated versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, to improve longevity and reliability.\n\nStill, Emma Renee maintained that her vehicle had under 20,000 miles at the time, and said Tesla replaced multiple components following the incident. She also emphasized that the charger itself was newly installed at a recently opened Wawa, raising questions about whether a fault during the charging handshake could have triggered the shutdown.\n\nOne of the most debated aspects of the video involved emergency door releases, particularly for rear-seat passengers. In the clip, the creator initially stated that the back seats lacked an emergency latch, a claim that many commenters disputed.\n\nTesla vehicles do include manual emergency releases for rear doors, but unlike the front doors, they are often hidden inside door pockets or beneath trim panels. Tesla’s own owner documentation notes that these releases are intentionally concealed to reduce the risk of accidental activation, especially by children.\n\nWhile several commenters criticized the creator for not knowing where the rear releases were located, others acknowledged that the design can be difficult to locate under stress. Some owners said they had added aftermarket labels or glow-in-the-dark markers to make the releases easier to find in an emergency.\n\nIn later comments, Emma Renee clarified that her primary concern was not her own exit, but the possibility of someone, such as her grandmother, being trapped in the back seat without guidance during a similar failure.\n\nDespite the video's dramatic nature, the incident does not appear to indicate a widespread defect or a new failure affecting Tesla vehicles. There are no recalls tied to charging-port–induced shutdowns, nor have regulators flagged similar incidents at Wawa charging locations.\n\nInstead, experts generally describe these scenarios as cascading electrical failures, in which a fault in one component, such as a low-voltage battery or charging interface, triggers the vehicle to shut down as a protective measure. Because EVs rely heavily on electronic systems rather than mechanical linkages, the effects can feel more abrupt to drivers unfamiliar with the architecture.\n\nThat distinction matters, particularly as viral videos can blur the line between rare cases and everyday risk. A vehicle losing electronic functionality while stationary is fundamentally different from a propulsion failure at speed, and there is no indication that the Model Y in this case posed a driving hazard before it powered down.\n\nThe incident has nonetheless sparked renewed discussion about owner education, emergency preparedness, and how clearly manufacturers communicate fail-safe features. It also underscores how EV adoption increasingly depends on trust, not just technology. As charging infrastructure expands and vehicles become more software-dependent, even uncommon failures can feel alarming when they challenge basic expectations about control and access.\n\nFor this Tesla owner, the experience ended with a tow truck and a repair, not an injury. But the video highlights how moments like these resonate far beyond a single parking lot, shaping perceptions of electric vehicles one clip at a time.\n\nInsideEVs reached out to Emma Renee via direct message and comment on the clip. We’ll update this if she responds.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established ​Canadian sales network, experts say.\n\nUnder the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually ‌from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.\n\nHowever, under one clause ‌in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.\n\nWhile many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.\n\nThe U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car ⁠from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles ‌from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.\n\nBut it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing ‍a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.\n\nNow, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.\n\n\"This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nTesla ​has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence ‌there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.\n\n\"Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,\" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.\n\nOther brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both ⁠owned by China's automaking group Geely.",

    "description": "Tesla owners' reactions to Elon Musk's announcement that FSD would only be available for $99 a month ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on the Netflix model for its self-driving software — and owners we talked to have mixed feelings about the move.\n\nOn Wednesday, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla's supervised Full Self-Driving software — known as FSD — will only be offered behind its $99-a-month paywall after February 14.\n\nIt's a major shift for the electric-car maker. Tesla first began selling its self-driving software in late 2016 for $5,000, later raising the price (it's currently $8,000) and introducing a monthly subscription option in 2021.\n\nNow, drivers who want their car to steer, brake, and change lanes on its own will only have the option to pay $99 month to month.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three Tesla owners about the change. Their reactions ranged from frustration to enthusiasm.\n\n\"It's a big turnoff for me,\" Leslie Snipes, an owner of a standard-range Model 3, told Business Insider. \"Especially since nearly everything is now a subscription.\"\n\nSnipes said she tested FSD during a complimentary one-month trial when she bought her car in 2022. She loved the feature at the time, but a lifetime purchase cost $10,000 back then — a cost she said was too high for her family.\n\nNow, her biggest concern is safety.\n\n\"I have much less confidence in Tesla's self-driving,\" she said. \"I've had multiple experiences where the cameras were inoperable due to low-light conditions or obstructions like rain, which makes this shift concerning.\"\n\nShe said she'd only consider paying for FSD for specific months, like when she is planning long road trips.\n\nScott Anderson, who just bought a Model Y in Arizona, said he never seriously considered paying thousands of dollars upfront for the software. He chose the monthly subscription and remains excited about the tech.\n\n\"My wife and I recently took a trip about 70 miles from home up into the mountains,\" he said. \"Our new car drove us the entire way without any interruptions.\"\n\nAnderson added that he hopes the monthly price will eventually come down as Tesla rolls out more advanced technology.\n\nBut for longtime Tesla owners who have already outright purchased the software, Musk's announcement carries different implications.\n\n\"I find myself using FSD more and more as I drive,\" Nikki Lindgren, a California Tesla owner who bought the technology years ago, told Business Insider. \"The change would mostly modify if or when we replace our current Tesla.\"\n\nLindgren said the shift to subscriptions could discourage her from buying a new Tesla unless the company allows customers to transfer previously purchased software to another vehicle.\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nTesla is facing some critical self-driving deadlines this year, including its robotaxis entering more major cities and ramping up volume production of the Cybercab.\n\nDelivering on the promises carries enormous weight for CEO Elon Musk. His attention-grabbing $1 trillion pay package is tied in part to the company's self-driving vision, raising the pressure to prove that its technology — and the revenue it generates — is moving closer to full autonomy.\n\nSeth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who monitors Tesla, said the company's switch to monthly subscriptions indicates \"growing confidence\" inside the EV maker about its technology's momentum. He even thinks drivers might soon be able to take their eyes off the road when the car is in FSD.\n\nBut he doesn't think that rollout will be paired with lower prices for consumers.\n\n\"Once unsupervised is released, I expect the price will rise to reflect the additional driving capabilities and we could see Tesla offer bundles that include charging and insurance in some states,\" he said. \"Admittedly, this just shifts the payment from one loan payment including the vehicle and FSD to two payments.\"\n\nGoldstein said he thinks most drivers will respond like Snipes, the most skeptical Tesla owner that Business Insider spoke to.\n\n\"This may lead to some consumers purchasing a Tesla as they can choose to buy FSD later or only purchase it in months when they plan to take a longer trip,\" he said.",

    "description": "Conventional trucks are so slow, they can block other motorists from passing and slow down the speed of traffic.",
    "fullText": "So far, electric vehicle giant Tesla has focused on developing the next generation of passenger vehicles. But, a video released on Twitter shows the power and capacity of Tesla's new Semi truck as it easily drives up a steep hill on the Donner Pass.\n\nConventional diesel semitrucks have historically struggled to get up to highway speed going up steep slopes. Many of them may reach only 60 miles per hour within 30 seconds, which can block other motorists from passing and slow down the speed of traffic. The Tesla Semi, in comparison, can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 20 seconds.\n\nTesla currently uses its semitrucks to carry materials between its California and Nevada facilities. Therefore, it's likely the Semi recorded in the video was carrying freight.\n\nBesides the apparent benefits of traversing across graded surfaces, Tesla's Semi may also revolutionize the trucking and hauling industry in terms of emissions. Combination trucks account for nearly 18% of motor vehicle emissions nationwide. Tesla's Semi has a smaller footprint and opens up the opportunity to be powered by alternative renewable sources like solar and wind.\n\nThe Semi uses 2 kilowatt hours of energy per mile and can travel up to 500 miles before needing a charge. Like its smaller EV counterparts, the Semi needs to charge for only 30 minutes to recover 70% of its range capacity.\n\nTrucking companies will see drastic financial returns from purchasing electric Semis rather than diesel vehicles. The company estimates buyers will save more than $200,000 on fuel in the first three years of ownership. The remote diagnostic system also decreases the maintenance and repairs needed on the vehicle, suggesting that the long-term cost of owning one may be more optimal than an internal combustion engine.\n\nThe first Tesla Semis were sold to PepsiCo in 2022, and Tesla remains one of the predominant users of the vehicles for its own trucking purposes. The company expects more of its Semis to be on the road in the coming years.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,\" the Tesla CEO wrote in a post on X.\n\nTesla owners currently have the option to buy FSD for $8,000 or pay $99 a month to access the service.\n\nIt comes as the company struggles to get customers to pay for the technology, which Musk has regularly described as critical to Tesla's future.\n\nIn Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, the company's CFO told investors that only around 12% of Tesla's current fleet subscribed to FSD, with quarterly revenue decreasing compared to the same period the previous year.\n\nBoosting FSD subscriptions is also a key part of Musk's mammoth pay package, which was approved by Tesla investors in November. Reaching 10 million FSD subscriptions is among the milestones that Tesla needs to hit for Musk to unlock the full $1 trillion payout.\n\nThe company's rollout of Full Self-Driving, which allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself in most situations but requires human supervision at all times, has attracted regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced investigations last year into whether Tesla correctly reported crashes linked to FSD, and over reports of Tesla vehicles with FSD activated running red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nTesla also faces a potential ban on selling vehicles in California after a judge ruled that the company's marketing of its Full Self Driving and Autopilot systems misled consumers.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "With US federal EV incentives gone, Tesla gets back to dominating the US market. It's all about volume and EV manufacturing scale.",
    "fullText": "Federal incentives for electric vehicles disappeared at the end of the third quarter, leaving the US market to survive on its own merits.\n\nSo, how did companies perform in this new, realistic environment?\n\nCox Automotive, an industry data provider, has just released EV sales estimates for the fourth quarter on Tuesday, and the numbers reveal which companies thrive and which struggle without government assistance.\n\nTesla once again dominates the EV market in the US. Its market share surged to 59% in Q4, up from 41% in the previous quarter, Cox data shows.\n\nOne major reason is that EV companies in the US now have to make the numbers work without government help. A significant part of the equation is volume.\n\nDespite a decline in sales recently, Tesla still sold 138,000 EVs in the US during the fourth quarter. That type of volume helps the company maintain relatively low prices while still making money.\n\nMost rivals don't have that volume, and their EV manufacturing operations just aren't as efficient as Tesla's because they still make other types of cars, which have way more parts than EVs. This can make them more expensive to manufacture and can lead to big losses.\n\n\"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker,\" Cox warned last year as federal incentives ended.\n\nFord's EV market share was measly 6% in the fourth quarter, while Rivian's stood at just 4%.\n\nGeneral Motors is performing somewhat better, with a market share of over 10%. Even here, the math just doesn't add up. General Motors took $6 billion in fourth-quarter charges tied to scaling back EV plans in the US.\n\nIn December, Ford abandoned large EVs because it couldn't make a profit on them. The company took a $20 billion write-down on its failing EV business. Rivian still loses a lot of money, although its cheaper R2 EV might improve things later this year.\n\nIn July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.\n\nIf EV operations can't reach high-volume scale, they risk constantly losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding. When incentives ended in the US, many players decided to give up.\n\nTesla remains the exception in the US. It's proving that, in this industry, volume equals survival.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Sales of the Cybertruck were far below the 250,000 annual target Musk set before the electric pickup rolled off the production line in 2023.",
    "fullText": "The Cybertruck is running out of road.\n\nTesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in the US last year, according to data from Cox Automotive released on Tuesday, as demand for Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup fizzled.\n\nThat's nearly half the number Tesla sold in 2024, and sales dropped 68% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nThe figures are a far cry from the target of 250,000 sales a year Musk set before the Cybertruck rolled off the production line in 2023.\n\nThe divisive electric truck amassed over 1 million reservations, but early models launched with a price tag of over $79,000, significantly higher than the nearly $40,000 sticker price Musk had floated in 2019.\n\nSince then, demand has been underwhelming — and collapsing sales have not been the only speed bump.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced a series of quality issues, with 10 recalls since 2023.\n\nWhile some of those issues have been fixed with a simple software update, others have proved more problematic. Tesla has issued recalls for accelerator pedals that could get trapped at full throttle, an optional off-road light bar that may detach and fly off the truck, and the Cybertruck's comically large windshield wiper failing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck's highly distinctive design, which caused Tesla significant production issues, has had the unintended effect of turning the angular EV into a target.\n\nMultiple Cybertruck owners told Business Insider last March that they had been hit by vandalism and verbal harassment amid the backlash over Tesla CEO Musk's federal cost-cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla has employed some creative strategies for turning around the Cybertruck's sales slump.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported in April that the EV giant was quietly rebranding the futuristic pickup as a working man's truck. And SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, has taken delivery of an unspecified number of Cybertrucks.\n\nUnlike Tesla's other vehicles, however, the Cybertruck is only available in a limited number of countries.\n\nTesla sells the pickup in Mexico and Canada, and recently started sales in Korea, but the Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel body and sharp edges make it almost impossible to sell in Europe and China, two of the EV giant's largest markets.\n\nTesla also launched the Cybertruck in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last year — three oil-rich nations where chargers are scarce, and EV sales are low.\n\nThe Cybertruck's woes mean it is unlikely to help Tesla turn around its global sales slump. Sales of all Tesla vehicles declined for the second consecutive year in 2025, with Chinese rival BYD surpassing it to become the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nMusk is not the only one to see ambitious plans for big electric pickups fall flat.\n\nFord sold just over 27,000 of its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck in 2025 and last month announced that it would replace the EV with an extended-range hybrid offering 700 miles of range.\n\nOther automakers have also backed away from electric pickups as an \"EV winter\" has taken hold in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nStellantis canceled plans to build an all-electric RAM truck in September, while Ford and GM have signalled they plan to build more gas-powered pickups as they rack up billions of dollars in charges over their EV strategy shifts.\n\nWhat the future holds for the Cybertruck is unclear. Tesla quietly removed the option to buy a cheaper, rear-wheel drive trim from its website after just five months in September, and there has been no word on mooted plans to build a smaller version of the truck, which still starts at around $80,000 in the US.\n\nPublicly, Musk doesn't seem bothered by the Cybertruck's low sales, regularly praising the stainless-steel truck on his X feed.\n\n\"Cybertruck is an incredible vehicle. Our best ever from Tesla,\" he wrote last month.",

    "fullText": "David Moss, 28, has been a Tesla owner since March 2024.\n\nMoss said Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) was the number one purchase driver.\n\nHe says he has traveled more than 11,000 miles across the US without touching the steering wheel.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Moss, 28, a resident of Puyallup, Washington, who has been documenting his experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Moss told Business Insider that he does not own Tesla stock.\n\nBusiness Insider verified Moss's travel logs, charging stops, and FSD mileage data that is displayed on his car. Tesla only displays FSD usage down to the 10th of a mile.\n\nI've owned a Tesla since March 2024.\n\nTesla's Full Self-Driving feature was the primary reason I made the purchase. I would say the electric aspect is almost an inconvenience, and FSD is my main interest in the Tesla.\n\nCharging around my hometown isn't a pain. There's a station near my house, and I have a charger at home.\n\nHowever, my commutes are long. I'm a product manager for a company that makes 3D lidar scanners, and a lot of my job is visiting clients on-site all around America.\n\nI drive over 50,000 miles a year. Given the number of miles I drive, an electric car is a slower form of transportation than a gas car.\n\nMy first Tesla was a Cybertruck, but unfortunately, I totaled it in August while I was driving it in off-road mode. In September, I bought the long-range Model 3. The company was running a promotion where if you bought a Model 3 before the tax credit expired, you got a free year of charging.\n\nSince then, I've put over 23,000 miles on the car. So I've been making good use of the free electricity.\n\nI began a road trip on October 28 and have since driven 18,741 miles.\n\nAround November 25, while I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, I got the FSD version 14.2 update and have driven over 11,000 miles without any intervention as of December 31.\n\nWhen I say no intervention, I mean down to the 10th of a mile — 100% no steering wheel or pedal touches. That includes parking and getting into a charging station.\n\nFSD navigated restaurants, supercharger stations, office complexes — every single part of the drive.\n\nDuring the trip, I've gone down several dirt roads and construction zones that had cones, reroutes, and road closures. One morning, I was in Reno, leaving my hotel, and the normal road was closed for construction. The car immediately turned around and found an alternative route.\n\nOne of the more interesting cases was in Wyoming during a severe windstorm.\n\nThere were alerts, warning of 80 mph winds. In about a hundred-mile stretch, I saw six different tipped-over semi-trucks.\n\nI was a little nervous about driving on the freeway with high-wind caution alerts, but FSD handled everything while I was on Interstate 80, traveling from Cheyenne to Evanston. FSD drove without even touching a lane marker once.\n\nI think in that situation, FSD shone more than usual.\n\nSince Raleigh, I've traveled across the country — down to Miami, across Texas, through the Rockies, and up to Medford, Oregon.\n\nAfter a two-day pit stop back in my hometown in Washington for Christmas Eve, I headed to Los Angeles and drove across the US until I hit South Carolina.\n\nI put on a lot of audiobooks and podcasts while FSD drives. I also took business calls or calls with friends and family.\n\nI haven't tested out being on my phone with my eyes off the road. That's still against the law, and it's just not worth the risk.\n\nI've never dozed off during the drive, but I'm also not constantly on the edge of my seat or grimacing while FSD is on.\n\nI'm a million times less scared than I've ever been in an Uber ride or with most of my friends. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the most pleasant driving I've experienced.\n\nWhen I started my road trip on October 28, my Tesla was on FSD version 13.2.9.\n\nEventually, when I was in the southern part of Alberta in Canada, I installed version 14.1. That was around the evening of November 5. Around November 25, I got 14.2.\n\nI have a Starlink Mini mounted underneath my Tesla's glass roof, allowing me to download updates remotely and install them while I sleep in my hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't call the difference between 14.1 and 14.2 a grand night-and-day difference, but there's definitely been a noticeable improvement under version 14: the ability to park, more speed profiles like \"Sloth\" and \"Mad Max\" mode, and just the overall smoothness.\n\nFor the first time, with 14.2, I was able to win people over when I showed FSD to my friends and family. Before they were like, \"Oh, that's kind of cool,\" \"It's a gimmick,\" or \"I'm not going to buy this.\" Now, they're saying, \"Oh wow, I actually need that.\"\n\nI can't speak enough about how much I love FSD and how much it inconveniences me to drive.\n\nA lot of the driving I currently do is simply because I don't want to fly. Because I know that when I arrive at the airport, I'm likely not going to be able to rent a car with FSD.\n\nThe record-setting was never really the focus.\n\nI didn't even check the FSD stat page for several hundred miles before I started seeing people post about it online, saying, \"Oh wow, I've actually not touched the wheel at all.\"\n\nAt this point, a technology like FSD is indispensable to having a car. The feature provides me with peace of mind, having that \"extra set of eyes\" on the road.\n\nThere's also a personal side to that because my father is legally blind and can't operate a vehicle. If there were one day an unsupervised Cybercab that he could buy, we'd buy it on day one.\n\nMy father's ecstatic. He believes he's one day closer to gaining his independence.",

    "description": "The class-action lawsuit is the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered door handles.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is facing more heat over its famously flush door handles.\n\nThe automaker was hit with a class-action lawsuit over door handle failures in its Model S EV on Friday, the latest in a long line of complaints over Tesla's electronically powered handles.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit was filed in Florida by John Urban, a Maitland-based Tesla owner, on behalf of those who had purchased or leased a 2014-2016 Model S.\n\nThe complaint alleges that the \"flush\" door handles on Tesla's luxury sedan, which are designed to pop out when the driver approaches, \"routinely fail\" after only a few years of use, leaving owners unable to get into the vehicle and creating a \"significant safety risk\" by potentially locking them out in emergency situations.\n\nThree out of the four door handles on Urban's 2015 Model S \"Ludicrous\" variant had failed by 2022, the complaint said, including the driver's seat door handle, forcing the Florida resident to climb over from the passenger side while he waited for repairs.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Tesla \"knew or should have known\" about the \"defective\" handles. It pointed to the automaker redesigning the door handles on post-2016 Model S vehicles to make them more reliable, adding that more recent models rarely experience the defect.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's the latest legal action Tesla has faced over the design of its door handles. The EV giant was among the first to pioneer electronically powered handles that sit flush against the car's surface, and this feature was a major selling point for the company's early models.\n\nHowever, multiple lawsuits have alleged that Tesla's electronic handles can become inoperable when the vehicle's low-voltage battery dies, trapping passengers inside during an emergency.\n\nIn October, the parents of two college students killed in a Cybertruck crash in California sued the company, alleging that the victims were trapped inside the burning vehicle after power to the Cybertruck's electric door failed.\n\nA month later, Tesla was sued by the family of two Wisconsin residents who died after their 2016 Model S crashed into a tree, with the lawsuit also alleging that the vehicle's door handle system failed during the crash.\n\nThe Texas-based automaker is also under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after some Model Y owners reported that their children had been trapped inside after the door handles failed.\n\nTesla's vehicles do include manual door releases, but critics have said that these can be difficult to access during an emergency situation. Franz von Holzhausen, the company's chief designer, told Bloomberg last September that Tesla was redesigning its door handles to provide more obvious manual controls.\n\nThe issue has also drawn political scrutiny, with one US House Rep. introducing a bill last week that would force automakers to include \"easy-to-find manual releases\" on all car doors.\n\nIn a new safety page on Tesla's website added last month, the company said its vehicles' doors would automatically unlock for emergency access, but added in a footnote that certain safety features may not be available for all vehicles based on build date.",

    "description": "Elon Musk is staring down several self-imposed deadlines this year, from Cybercab volume production to a much-hyped Roadster demo.",
    "fullText": "It's a critical year for Tesla. Elon Musk says so.\n\nIn earnings calls, podcast interviews, and a steady stream of posts on X, the outspoken CEO has spent the past year teasing a wave of new hardware and software that he says will define Tesla's future.\n\n\"2026 will be something special,\" Musk posted on X on January 1.\n\nTesla's promises for the year fall into four major bets: self-driving software for consumer cars, a fully autonomous robotaxi service, humanoid robots, and showing off at least one long-delayed new vehicle.\n\nAnalysts say the company's future increasingly hinges on just one thing — whether its AI-powered autonomy can work at scale.\n\n\"I think 2026 is going to be the prove-it year for Tesla's robotaxi business,\" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at Morningstar who closely watches Tesla, told Business Insider. \"That's ultimately going to be the major driver for Tesla this year.\"\n\nLast June, Tesla Model Ys and Model 3s started carting passengers around Austin, Texas with no humans behind the steering wheel. Instead, the company launched with so-called \"safety drivers\" in the front passenger seat to intervene if needed.\n\nGoldstein said he's watching closely to see where regulators allow Tesla's self-driving vehicles to operate — and whether the company becomes confident enough in its technology to remove safety drivers from the front seats entirely.\n\nRight now, the robotaxis are driving in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta.\n\nDuring the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla's purpose-built autonomous vehicle, known as the Cybercab, would begin volume production in April. The two-passenger vehicle is designed without a steering wheel or brake pedal.\n\n\"That's really a vehicle that's optimized for full autonomy,\" he said on the call. \"I think the demand will be pretty nutty.\"\n\nTesla has also claimed a significant lead over competitors in consumer self-driving data. During the same earnings call, Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of Autopilot and AI software, said customers had driven more than six billion miles using Full Self-Driving in supervised mode.\n\n\"That's a big milestone,\" Elluswamy said. \"Overall, the safety continues to be very good.\"\n\nThose claims come as both legacy automakers and tech companies push deeper into autonomous driving. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nvidia unveiled its new self-driving car platform. Rivian said its $45,000 R2 SUV, launching in early 2026, will include self-driving capabilities. Ford plans to roll out advanced autonomous tech on its 2027 electric pickup, while General Motors is offering point-to-point hands-free driving in its high-end Cadillac Escalade IQ.\n\nMusk has dismissed the competition. In a post on X, he said Tesla was five years ahead of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — in self-driving technology.\n\nTesla is also preparing to reintroduce the second-generation Roadster, a two-door electric sports car first unveiled more than 8 years ago that has been repeatedly delayed. The vehicle is now slated for another unveiling on April Fool's Day.\n\nIn November, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that if Peter Thiel wanted a future with flying cars, he should get it. Musk has said the new Roadster is a collaboration with SpaceX and will include rocket technology.\n\n\"It's going to be the most memorable product unveil ever,\" he said, before telling the notorious podcaster that he set the unveil date for April Fools for \"deniability.\"\n\nThe Semi, an electric eighteen-wheeler, is also expected to roll out of Tesla's Nevada factory in the first half of 2026.\n\nEarly production models traversed California's highways with Pepsi and Walmart products in pilot tests.\n\nThen there's Optimus — a major bet for Tesla and one that Musk has said will be \"the biggest product ever.\"\n\nMusk has said the humanoid robots will eventually handle general-purpose tasks like folding laundry, tightening screws, or stirring a pot of pasta.\n\nBut manufacturing Optimus has proved challenging. Musk has said designing its hands, for example, is \"an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.\"\n\nIn a 2024 post on X, he claimed Tesla was aiming for \"high production for other companies\" by 2026, suggesting the robots could one day be manufactured at scale for outside customers.\n\nMusk's recent track record for deadlines has given some investors reason to be cautious of the CEO's projections for the coming year.\n\nMusk is a self-proclaimed optimist when it comes to deadlines and goals, but he does have a history of delivering much of what he promises — eventually.\n\n\"Elon is a visionary,\" Goldstein told Business Insider. \"He's figured out a lot of very difficult problems in the past when other people couldn't — making profitable EVs and reusable rockets — he deserves a lot of credit.\"\n\nBut Goldstein said Tesla's path to automotive dominance is narrowing. As the company has focused heavily on autonomy, other automakers have improved vehicle hardware quickly enough to challenge Tesla's advantage.\n\nThat's particularly true in China, he said.\n\n\"BYD has surpassed Tesla and then gone after a lower price point in key markets in China and Europe,\" he said.\n\nTesla has reported two consecutive years of sales declines, Goldstein added, and \"it's looking like 2026 could be a third.\" Meanwhile, many US automakers are pulling back from EVs and car-buyers can no longer enjoy the $7,500 EV incentive.\n\n\"2026 is going to be a bit of a challenge for Tesla as the EV scene has since dramatically changed, especially with last year's disappearance of any helpful federal tax credits,\" Robby DeGraff, a product and consumer insights manager at AutoPacific, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Subtle, slight refreshes of the Model Y and Model 3 plus reveals of the Cybercab and other innovations like the humanoid robots were newsworthy sure, but the reality is Tesla's lineup is stale and lagging behind much of the competition in terms of design, performance, and features,\" he added.\n\nDespite those risks, many investors remain sold on Musk's vision.\n\nIn mid-December, Tesla shares hit a record high of more than $481. The stock is up about 12% over the last year, including a roughly 50% surge in the past six months.\n\n\"I think the most important thing for Tesla to do right now, especially as we see the EV market slow a bit, is ready and ensure there's a proper entry-level, affordable EV out there for consumers,\" DeGraff added.\n\nDeGraff said the new \"Standard\" versions of the Model 3 and Model Y are \"a good step\" but \"there's more work to be done to bring that pricing down, which still remains a major deterrent for uncertain EV shoppers.\"",

    "description": "Tesla and legacy automakers are shifting to budget-friendly EVs amid sales declines, subsidy cuts, and mounting US consumer auto debt concerns.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, the electric-vehicle industry looks like it's heading into 2026 with a flat tire.\n\nFederal subsidies are gone, and EV sales have cooled since September. Even Tesla, America's dominant EV maker, is experiencing a sales slowdown.\n\nNow, carmakers are scrapping once-ambitious EV plans.\n\nIn December, Ford discontinued production of the all-electric F-150 and announced a $19.4 billion write-down tied to its battery investments. A week later, Volkswagen halted production of the electric ID. Buzz minivan for 2026, with plans to potentially revive it in 2027.\n\nThat trend snowballed on Thursday. General Motors said it expects to lose $6 billion as it retools its EV strategy. On the same day, Stellantis went even further, discontinuing every plug-in hybrid in its lineup — including the once-bestselling Jeep Wrangler 4xe.\n\nBut beneath the headline-grabbing cancellations, there's a quieter shift underway that could end up reviving the ailing EV market. It has everything to do with the auto industry's biggest problem: price.\n\n\"Electric vehicles are becoming more affordable as more mainstream options enter the market,\" Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told Business Insider. \"We're finally seeing automakers deliver EVs at price points beyond the luxury segment.\"\n\nThis year, legacy automakers — including several that recently pulled back EV projects — are preparing their factory floors to churn out lower-cost electric cars. Startups are jumping into the fray, too.\n\nNissan's Leaf just rebooted as a $29,000 Tesla Model Y look-alike. Subaru and Toyota are launching the Uncharted and C-HR — nearly identical crossover SUVs with $35,000 starting prices. Kia will have a $35,000 competitor with the EV3. Rivian is about to release its $45,000 R2 onto American roads. The Jeff Bezos-backed Slate anticipates its mid-$20,000 pickup will launch in the fall. Chevy's Bolt is returning with $29,000 on the sticker.\n\nThe push toward cheaper EVs is expected to roll into 2027, too, with Ford launching its $30,000 electric pickup.\n\nIt all comes as Americans struggle to keep up with every-expanding vehicle debt.\n\nThe average price of a new vehicle sold in the US hit $50,077 this week, Automotive News reported, citing Cloud Theory's average marketed price metric. That sticker shock has pushed the median buyer to put $6,579 down and take on monthly payments of $748 stretched across nearly six years, NerdWallet data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans carried a record $1.66 trillion in auto loan debt in 2024, the most recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That's more than credit cards and federal student loans, and second only to mortgages. Delinquencies also crept higher that year, a sign that many consumers ran out of room to absorb ever-larger car payments.\n\n\"The reality was that new vehicle sales were being driven by well-heeled consumers,\" Keating said — a dynamic that was especially pronounced in the EV market.\n\nSince 2020, when legacy automakers started launching their first EVs to compete with Tesla, they focused heavily on top-end cars with luxury prices.\n\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning, for example, started around $50,000. Higher-end trims climbed into the high-$90,000 range. Rivian's R1S SUV started at $77,000. Lucid's Air sedan cost between $70,000 and $250,000.\n\nIn September, the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped modestly bring down those high prices largely expired.\n\nNow, as those same carmakers roll out lower-priced models, the industry appears to be course correcting, Keating said. Much of the early EV premium reflected the cost of building an entirely new ecosystem, she added.\n\nEarly buyers weren't just paying for a car. They were helping automakers finance new battery plants, retool factories, retrain workers, and pour billions into supply chains that didn't yet exist.\n\nSix years later, much of that infrastructure is already in place. As a result, new EV consumers are beginning to see those sunk costs roll off the sticker price.\n\nNow, automakers are going to see how much consumers actually want competitive EV products.\n\n\"We're entering a period where we'll see what organic demand for EVs actually looks like, without the policy thumb on the scale,\" Keating said. \"They're not going to abandon EV platforms. They've already made the investments.\"",

    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, once said the \"hard part\" of getting rich is pulling together the first $100,000, as that's often a \"long struggle\" for someone starting at zero.\n\nElon Musk is at the polar opposite end of the wealth spectrum — worth so much on paper that he can gain or lose tens of billions of dollars and barely move the needle on his net worth.\n\nAfter just two trading days this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has added $24 billion to his personal fortune, lifting it by about 4% to $644 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe world's richest person by far — he's worth more than double Alphabet cofounder Larry Page in second place — was last year's biggest wealth gainer with a $187 billion increase.\n\nMusk is comfortably leading that list in 2026 as well. As of Monday's close, Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy is a distant runner up with a roughly $8 billion gain.\n\nIt's not exactly clear why Musk's fortune has swelled this year. Tesla stock has only inched up 0.4%, boosting the value of its CEO's stake by less than $2 billion even if his previously disputed stock options are included.\n\nSpaceX's valuation rocketed to $800 billion in December, but that was reflected in Musk's wealth gain last year. Nor have there been any publicized valuation increases for his other companies, which include xAI, Neuralink, and The Boring Company.\n\nThat suggests Bloomberg has simply tweaked its calculations, causing a change in net worth that would be material even for Musk's fellow centibillionaires, but appears closer to a rounding error for Musk.\n\nTech billionaires like Musk have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, as investors continue to bet big that their companies will capitalize on the red-hot trend.\n\nPage and his cofounder, Sergey Brin, have both added over $2 billion to their fortunes this year, thanks to Alphabet shares climbing 1% or so.

    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

    "description": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever, and one \"Big Short\" trader says it's the most overvalued stock in the market.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever.\n\nIt's up nearly double since bottoming out last April. And those gains are happening at a time when sales are declining. Tesla isn't even the world's biggest EV-maker anymore.\n\nThe situation spotlights the growing disconnect between the company's valuation in the stock market and its ability to keep dominating the sale of EVs.\n\nBulls will shrug off those concerns and say the company's AI efforts will eventually provide the earnings juice to normalize those valuations. Bears, on the other hand, are not so forgiving.\n\nPorter Collins — the former FrontPoint Partners trader who was immortalized in \"The Big Short\" for his bet against the US housing market — fits firmly into latter camp.\n\nHe told Business Insider recently that he sees Tesla as the market's most overvalued stock.\n\n\"I think that the most obvious one in all of the S&P is Tesla,\" he said. \"I think that's the poster child of the asset class.\"\n\nHe said that while fellow Big Tech leader Nvidia trades at roughly 45 times next year's earnings forecast, Tesla currently trades at almost 300 times the 2026 projection.\n\nCollins thinks that Tesla should be valued in line with other automakers, or other Big Tech firms. He argues that it's presently in a world of its own, not being valued on the fundamentals of any specific sector.\n\n\"I honestly think Tesla is just a meme stock,\" he stated. \"People follow Elon Musk and they think he will produce generational type products in the future. He may or may not, but that's the bet right now.\"\n\nCollins doesn't necessarily consider that a bad thing. But he does think it clouds investors' ability to properly assess it.\n\n\"Meme stocks have tended to be high flyers,\" he admitted. \"Some meme stocks have come back to Earth, but others have not. GameStop and AMC eventually came back to economic reality. Tesla? We'll see.\"\n\nCollins isn't the only \"Big Short\" alumnus who feels this way about Tesla. Michael Burry has recently criticized the company's lofty valuation on his Substack, although — like Collins — he has stopped short of actually shorting the stock.",

    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "fullText": "Chinese auto giant BYD on Friday dethroned U.S. rival Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles on a calendar-year basis.\n\nThe milestone caps an extraordinary rise for BYD, a company Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed by laughing at their products during a 2011 Bloomberg interview.\n\nIn a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.\n\nMusk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tesla ended a roller coaster year with its sales going into reverse.\n\nElon Musk's automaker said on Friday that it sold 418,227 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, down by 15.6% from the same period in 2024.\n\nIt means Tesla's annual sales have declined for the second consecutive year, and that Chinese rival BYD has surpassed Tesla for the first time in annual sales of battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to sell around 441,000 EVs, per data compiled by Bloomberg, while Tesla released its own, more pessimistic, analyst consensus forecast of 422,850 units in an unusual move earlier this week.\n\nBYD said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units in 2025. Tesla said it delivered about 1.64 million vehicles for the year.\n\nTesla recorded its first-ever annual sales decline in 2024, after years of explosive growth. The latest figures suggest the company has been hit hard by the demise of the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September.\n\nThe looming deadline saw US buyers race to snap up electric vehicles, driving record sales for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOnce the tax credit ended, however, EV sales dropped across the board, including at Tesla's rivals Ford, Hyundai, and Kia.\n\nThe slump saw Tesla's sales hit their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the brand rolling out cheaper versions of its bestselling Model 3 and Y vehicles a month before.\n\nTesla has also faced difficulties this year in Europe and China, two of its biggest international markets.\n\nIn China, the EV giant has faced fierce competition from local rivals offering high-tech electric models at rock-bottom prices.\n\nTesla's sales have plummeted in Europe amid backlash over CEO Musk's endorsement of far-right German party AfD, with December registrations dropping 66% year-over-year in France and 44% in Spain, according to national auto association data.\n\nAnalysts previously told Business Insider that Tesla is also suffering from a stale product lineup. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and the divisive pickup has been a sales disappointment.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Tesla's stock price hit a record high in December as investors expressed optimism over the automaker's robotaxi rollout.\n\nTesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June and has ambitious plans to expand autonomous ride-hailing to multiple cities in the US this year.\n\nMusk has said the company's future lies in its robotaxi and Optimus robot initiatives, and the Austin-based automaker is preparing to begin mass production in April of its Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nIn an earnings call in October, Musk said that the looming launch of Tesla's \"unsupervised\" Full Self-Driving software would boost demand for the company's vehicles, and told investors that the robotaxi service in Austin would operate without safety monitors by the end of 2025.\n\nMusk said on December 24 that he took a ride around Austin without a safety driver, but as of Wednesday, they were still sitting inside vehicles available to the public.",
