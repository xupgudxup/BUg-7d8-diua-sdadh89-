    "description": "\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant.\"",
    "fullText": "A six-second clip of a Tesla Optimus robot's \"suspicious tumble\" emerged on Reddit, Electrek reported, reviving skepticism about the electric vehicle manufacturer's autonomous technology.\n\nIn recent months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been laser-focused on the company's artificial intelligence and robotics endeavors. Musk has asserted that \"AI and robotics\" were the only things that can save the United States from financial doom, and that those technologies would make money obsolete.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Tesla hosted an \"Autonomy Visualized\" event at a dealership in Miami, and a user on Reddit's r/TeslaMotors shared a brief clip of Optimus' reverse face-plant.\n\nTesla Optimus\n byu/Decent_Cheesecake643 inteslamotors\n\nIn the six-second video, Optimus was seen knocking over a few plastic water bottles before toppling over backward. However, the robot's unmistakably human gesture served as a \"Wizard-of-Oz\"-like reveal of the man behind the curtain. (Click here if the embedded video does not appear.)\n\n\"Looks like the operator took off their VR headset,\" a user observed, which was the general consensus on a different Reddit thread shared two days later.\n\n\"That's exactly what happened,\" another user replied, with another possibility that a teleoperator simply noticed they had knocked over some bottles and threw up their arms in dismay, unintentionally causing the robot to lose its balance.\n\nOne Reddit comment depicting a GIF of a \"Robocop 2\" scene in which a malfunctioning Robocop prototype makes a similar gesture to lift off its helmet racked up over 17,000 likes. Electrek commenters were equally unimpressed.\n\n\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant,\" one wrote. \"Everything Tesla does with robots seems to be a disappointing disaster.\"\n\nAnyone who follows Tesla developments is deeply familiar with Musk's tendency to wildly underestimate timelines.\n\nIn 2019, he famously predicted that 1 million driverless Tesla Robotaxis would be criss-crossing American roads in 2020.\n\nWhen they finally debuted on a small scale in June, it was obvious to riders that human operators were involved — yet Robotaxi crashes also occurred at a surprising rate.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTesla's Optimus was first unveiled in 2022, but coverage of its purported capabilities often focused on the obvious human intervention. If Optimus were Tesla's sole focus, its level of autonomy would be less of a concern.\n\nHowever, Musk has long prioritized autonomous EVs over other advancements. He recently promised that Tesla drivers could soon \"text and drive\" safely, forcing law enforcement agencies to reiterate that the activity remains illegal.\n\nAmid plans to release an autonomous model called the Cybercab without seeking the necessary regulatory approvals, Tesla's struggles to make autonomous driving a reality can undermine consumer trust and discourage drivers from making their next car an EV.\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla remains the most prominent EV manufacturer; if a perception that the brand is unsafe persists, fewer EVs on the road and more tailpipe pollution could result.\n\nAfter a challenging 2025 and Tesla's Optimus-related missteps, the brand is leaning heavily on the Cybercab's debut to turn things around.\n\nThis month, Musk said Tesla's Robotaxi fleet would double in size before the year was out, but questions about its level of autonomy lingered.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Here are 4 ways Rivian just stepped deeper into Tesla's turf",
    "description": "Rivian revealed ambitious plans for fully autonomous driving, featuring an in-house chip, an in-car AI assistant, and a Tesla-like subscription model.",
    "fullText": "Rivian is all-in on autonomous driving, stepping deeper into a territory Tesla has long positioned itself to dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, at Rivian's R&D office in Palo Alto, the EV maker unveiled a road map to develop autonomous-driving capabilities for its future lineup of vehicles, including new hardware for the highly anticipated R2 — Rivian's cheapest car to date.\n\nThat road map includes a new silicon chip, designed in-house, that will power Rivian's next-generation hardware and support self-driving functions. The new hardware is expected to ship with R2 by the end of 2026, Rivian said.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been hinting at autonomous ambitions in recent years. However, since the company's first shipment of vehicles in 2021, Rivian's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) software — Driver+ and the Rivian Autonomy Platform — has been more akin to Tesla Autopilot than Full Self-Driving Supervised. Tesla's Autopilot provides lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, while FSD can recognize traffic lights, conduct turns, and drive to a destination under constant driver supervision.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens Rivian's rivalry with Tesla as both companies have expressed goals of fully autonomous driving and licensing their software platforms to other automakers.\n\nRivian's partnership with Volkswagen, announced last year, was a clear first shot at those licensing ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently balked on X that no automaker wanted to license FSD.\n\nHere are four ways Rivian is taking a page out of Tesla's playbook.\n\nRivian has been using a combination of Nvidia and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips to power various vehicle functions, including driver-assistance and infotainment systems.\n\nNow, the company is turning to in-house silicon to power its next-generation autonomous driving hardware.\n\n\"At the core of Rivian's technology roadmap is the transition to in-house silicon, designed specifically for the vision-centric physical AI,\" the company said.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the chips will be manufactured by TSMC.\n\nTesla began a production shift toward in-house chips in 2019 and has since released two iterations, AI3 and AI4. Musk has said that Tesla's next-generation chip, AI5, will be 40 times better than its predecessor.\n\nRivian's \"Gen 3 Autonomy\" hardware is under validation and is expected to be shipped with R2 by the end of 2026, the company said.\n\nWith the new chips, Rivian's explicit goal is to achieve full autonomy — that's Level 4, or the kind of self-driving technology seen in Alphabet's Waymo, in which driver supervision is not required.\n\nMusk has already made full autonomy Tesla's north star, pledging to turn every personally-owned Tesla into a robotaxi that can generate revenue.\n\nThe Tesla CEO's goals have been met with considerable skepticism, particularly due to the company's decision to abandon lidar, a sensor that many industry leaders consider essential for safety and redundancy in self-driving cars.\n\nRivian, for its part, plans to incorporate lidar into the R2 vehicle. The sensor appears to be installed within the car, just above the middle of the windshield.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the company collaborated with a third party on the \"exterior design\" of Rivian's \"lidar implementation.\"\n\nThe company did not share a timeline for launching fully autonomous driving.\n\nIn the near term, Rivian will update its ADAS with hands-free assisted driving capability. The feature won't be functional on every road, according to a press release.\n\nRivian said it will be available on \"over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada\" and can operate \"off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines.\"\n\nAt Thursday's event, Scaringe also suggested potential robotaxi ambitions.\n\n\"This also enables us to pursue opportunities in the rideshare space,\" the CEO said.\n\nRivian is following Tesla's FSD subscription model for what it's calling \"Autonomy+.\"\n\nThe software will launch \"early 2026\" and be priced at $49.99 a month or $2,500 for a one-time purchase.\n\nTesla's FSD is $99 a month or $8,000 up front.\n\nRivian said the software will be continuously updated. The \"trajectory\" for the feature will be \"point-to-point\" navigation — where users type in a destination, and the car drives itself just like FSD — as well as eyes-off driving capabilities and \"personal L4\" capabilities, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that \"hundreds of millions of miles contribute to the development of Autonomy+.\"\n\n\"This data is comprised of samples from around the US and Canada year-round, capturing diversity in both geography and seasonality,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk announced in July an integration of xAI's Grok in Tesla vehicles, providing a chatbot that drivers can talk to and, more recently, ask for directions.\n\nRivian will be following a similar playbook with \"Rivian Assistant,\" an AI voice interface that will be \"model-agnostic,\" according to the automaker.\n\n\"Our framework allows us to orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task,\" a Rivian spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said in a press release that the AI assistant can connect to third-party apps and will start with the integration of Google Calendar.\n\nThe AI assistant can also assist with vehicle diagnostics and control certain vehicle functions, such as activating the car's seat heaters.\n\nThe feature will be shipped early 2026 on Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.\n\nThe analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business.\n\n\"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"\n\nIt's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nPercoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months.\n\n\"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.\n\nPercoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.\n\nIt cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots.\n\nOne risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern.\n\n\"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"\n\nAnd while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.\n\nPercoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",
