    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "title": "Morgan Stanley cuts Tesla's stock rating from 'buy' for the first time in 2 years on valuation concerns",
    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.\n\nThe analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business.\n\n\"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"\n\nIt's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nPercoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months.\n\n\"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.\n\nPercoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.\n\nIt cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots.\n\nOne risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern.\n\n\"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"\n\nAnd while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.\n\nPercoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",
