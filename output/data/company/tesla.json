    "description": "Mercedes-Benz's electric CLA is priced $5,000 above the premium trim of the Tesla Model 3 — for an entirely different driving experience, BI found.",
    "fullText": "Calling a car, especially an EV, \"software-defined,\" when it's not a Tesla or Rivian can feel like a trap; it exposes a carmaker to some misleading or unhelpful comparisons.\n\nAt a media event with Mercedes-Benz earlier this month, I heard company representatives use the same phrase — \"software-defined vehicle\" or SDV — to describe the new CLA, Mercedes' entry-level EV, which starts at $47,250.\n\nThe CLA will be the launch platform for Mercedes' new MB.OS operating system, which will include an AI voice-assistant powered by both ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Drivers will interact with the new software interface through a screen that stretches across the entire dashboard. There are nearly 40 inches of display, including the driver's seat. It's a lot of screen.\n\nThere's also an advanced driver assistance system, which has become standard in modern vehicles. Mercedes plans to launch MB.DRIVE Assist PRO next year, which is supposed to share some of the ADAS functionalities as Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised.\n\nAs I heard Mercedes employees talk about the new CLA, I couldn't help think: Here's another legacy automaker now trying to play catch-up with major EV players.\n\nThat was before I got behind the wheel.\n\nI had the chance to drive the new CLA for about two hours around San Francisco. A week later, I demoed Tesla's premium trim of the Model 3, which is about $5,000 less than the entry-level CLA option.\n\nMercedes' new EV is no Tesla. Far from it. But, after my drive, I'd say it doesn't have to be.\n\nMy demo CLA didn't come equipped with Mercedes' MB.Drive Assist Pro, which is designed to be a Tesla FSD-level ADAS — essentially, supervised self-driving from the parking lot to the destination.\n\nStill, I was curious to try the Level 2 ADAS that came equipped in the car. A Mercedes spokesperson told me the latest update should provide a \"smoother overall driving experience with traffic light recognition and stopping.\"\n\nThe feature can be more comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, which provides steering assist, lane change assist, and recognizes traffic lights.\n\nIn a city like San Francisco, where there can be a lot of turning and stopping, relying on the ADAS felt a little tedious. I had to take over the wheel or press the brakes quite a bit to make a turn or wait for a pedestrian to cross.\n\nHowever, there was a crystal-clear moment in my drive when I realized my desire for an ADAS, which essentially drives for me, is secondary.\n\nPart of my test drive included traveling up O'Shaughnessy Boulevard, a long, winding road in San Francisco that leads to the Twin Peaks area.\n\nThe road in front of me was clear. I wasn't sure what was going on with the ADAS, whether it was on or \"suspended.\" So at one point, I disengaged the driver assist and pressed the pedal to see how it handled the curvy roads.\n\nReader — the CLA is a lot of fun to drive. Even in the busier city streets, the CLA's compact profile and torque from its electric powertrain made weaving past slower cars enjoyable — something an ADAS can't do, at least not yet.\n\nAnd that's a huge point that helped me overcome this mental reflex to compare the CLA to the Model 3.\n\nIn a Tesla, the driving experience can feel secondary to the technology.\n\nOutside the steering wheel, there's little else getting in between the driver and the large touchscreen, which is Tesla's goal.\n\nThe EV maker aims for most interaction between the car and the driver to occur through the screen. After all, Tesla's ultimate technological endgame is full autonomy. The bug or user error is the act of driving itself.\n\nWith the CLA, I felt Mercedes made a car that you'd prefer to drive — and everything from the premium-level interior to the AI voice assistant only helps you focus on that act.\n\nPart of the feeling is buoyed by the brand itself: There's something wholly uncool about spending 50 grand or more on a sporty Mercedes-Benz only to say that you don't really drive the thing.\n\nThat's not the most rational defense for buying a car. However, Mercedes itself almost advertises the CLA as an emotional experience rather than a rational purchase.\n\nSee how the German automaker talked about the CLA in some of its early press material: \"The most emotional vehicle in its class,\" \"sensual purity,\" and the \"style rebel\" that \"underscores the sporty side of the Mercedes-Benz brand.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called his cars a \"very sophisticated computer on wheels.\"\n\nWe're talking about very different audiences here.\n\nThe CLA does throw up some numbers that are competitive with the leading EV players: an EPA-estimated range of 374 miles, 268 horsepower, and a 10% to 80% charging time of 22 minutes for the CLA 250+ model.\n\nThe premium rear-wheel drive Model 3 I drove has an EPA-estimated range of 363 miles. Tesla doesn't break down horsepower or charging time the same way Mercedes does, but, according to Kelley Blue Book, most Tesla models can charge to 80% around 15 minutes.\n\nMercedes also plans to introduce a hybrid variant of the CLA, utilizing the automaker's new \"modular architecture.\" This is essentially the skateboard platform that EV companies use, allowing them to build other models efficiently on the same foundation.\n\nMercedes is just one of many legacy automakers that are now hedging their bets on EV-only segments and expanding hybrid options.\n\nIf the vast majority of consumers continue to remain uncertain about electric cars, Tesla is unfortunately boxed out of that game.",

    "description": "Posters that appeared at Tesla's California factories and a review of LinkedIn profiles show how the automaker is scaling its ride-hailing service.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is going all in on its \"Robotaxi\" service — and putting factory workers and sales staff in drivers' seats to make it happen.\n\nThe electric-car maker has started recruiting workers off factory lines to operate its ride-hailing fleet. Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas.

A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "description": "Tesla was struggling hard as recently as March. But its stock has soared as the company's fortunes have turned around.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a good year for comebacks.\n\nWe got the first \"Final Destination\" movie in 14 years. Future NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Philip Rivers unretired last week after nearly five years away. And of course you have Michael Burry ferociously blogging up a storm after an extended public absence.\n\nThe stock market has also seen its share of reclamation stories, with none more high-profile than Tesla, the eternal lightning rod.\n\nAfter a post-election Trump bump in late 2024, the company endured a difficult first quarter. Shares were nearly cut in half as CEO Elon Musk pivoted to government work by spearheading DOGE, and as sales fell globally. It was a grim time for shareholders.\n\nBut the company was able to turn things around, and currently sits just below record highs. The chart below, and the accompanying sections, trace the timeline of Tesla's stock resurgence.\n\nApril: Musk steps back from DOGE\n\nInvestors were getting restless that Musk was too focused on Washington, and not focused enough on making EVs. Then, when he said he'd step away from DOGE, they breathed a collective sigh of relief, helping along a 25% rally over just four days.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to lower their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days. The stock ended up rising 17% that week. There would be further agreements with China, but this initial one marked the biggest inflection point.\n\nEarly September: Tesla introduces possible $1 trillion pay package for Musk\n\nThe argument in favor of such a lucrative package was that the continued presence of Musk as CEO makes up a large chunk of the company's value.\n\nIts introduction showed Tesla's board was serious about keeping him around, which pleased investors. Shares rallied 17% over the following week. The package was ultimately approved in November, which also pushed the stock higher.\n\nMid September: Musk buys back a bunch of shares\n\nTalk about throwing fuel on the fire. Musk's decision to buy back $1 billion worth of Tesla stock ignited another leg higher, pushing shares 7% higher in a single session. They then climbed an additional 8% the following week.\n\nMusk being willing to spend his own money on Tesla stock signaled confidence in the business, and comfort with valuation levels.\n\nNovember: Fed comments clinch a December rate cut\n\nThe December rate cut may have come and gone as a relative formality, which makes it easy to forget that it was still in jeopardy as recently as mid-November. Then, New York Fed President John Williams sealed the deal with some commentary on Nov. 21. Tesla rallied sharply alongside the broader market, soaring 10% over the next week.\n\nIt's been mostly a straight shot higher to records since then.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\n\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\n\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk.\n\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett, the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\n\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle, Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\n\nThe serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted.\n\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\n\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI. In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.",

    "description": "Tesla stock staged a massive rebound, with shares climbing 120% from their low in April on a handful of positive catalysts.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock has mounted a stunning comeback in the latter half of this year.\n\nShares of Elon Musk's carmaker have erased their losses after plummeting earlier in 2025, and, as of this week, have clawed their way back to all-time highs.\n\nTesla closed at a record $489.88 a share on Tuesday. The stock is up 121% from its low in early April. Shares are up 26% for the year as of Wednesday morning, putting the company in the upper echelon of Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThe rally in recent months marks a remarkable turnaround for the stock, which has been battered in volatile trading and mired in a bear market for much of the first half of the year. Shares of the EV company had plunged more than 50% from their peak in December 2024 to their trough in April, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's rally this week to all-time highs came as Musk gave a bullish update on Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin. Investors have pinned a lot of hopes on self-driving tech amid this year's dip in car sales. Along with its robotics initiatives, markets see Tesla's non-auto business as the primary bullish catalyst heading into 2026.\n\nA general risk on mood amid rate cuts and more optimistic forecasts for stocks next year has also helped spur the latest leg of Tesla's comeback.\n\nHere's what has driven the stock's blistering rally in the last several months.\n\nMusk said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. The news sparked relief among investors, who have long complained that the CEO may be too distracted by his sprawling empire of companies and his political ambitions to focus on Tesla.\n\nShares rose nearly 20% after Musk made the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to slash their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days.\n\nThe agreement temporarily removed a key headwind for Tesla, which sources its supplies heavily from China. The nation also makes up a key market for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nTesla shares rose alongside the broader market, climbing nearly 9% after the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nSince then, other positive developments between the US and China have also helped give Tesla a boost:\n\nElon Musk appeared to mend his relationship with President Donald Trump after the two billionaires publicly feuded over Musk's opposition to the Republicans' tax and spending bill.\n\nIn the heat of their argument, the White House said Trump was considering selling or giving away the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year. The president also threatened to yank contracts the government struck with Elon Musk's companies.\n\n\"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,\" Musk wrote in a post on X on June 11.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post in an interview the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice.\"\n\nTesla shares rose 6% through the end of the week.\n\nTesla rolled out a new pay package for Musk after a Delaware Court struck down a previous $56 billion package.\n\nShares rose 12% in the week following the announcement on September 5.\n\nThe new package, from which Musk can earn up to $1 trillion, was approved by shareholders in November and comes attached with aggressive targets. For Musk to earn his massive payout, he must boost the company's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million cars a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots.\n\nOn September 12, Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a securities filing released the following Monday. The purchase boosted Musk's ownership of the company from around 13% to 15%.\n\nInvestors are looking at the purchase as a sign of commitment from Musk, who has been accused of neglecting his duties at Tesla since he first sought to acquire Twitter in 2022.\n\nTesla shares rose another 3% through the end of the week.",

    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",

    "title": "Tesla's latest launch isn't a car — it's a $350 pickleball paddle — and it's not even electric",
    "description": "Tesla has partnered with Selkirk to launch a $350 pickleball paddle \"optimized for high performance play.\"",
    "fullText": "From Elon Musk — the guy who brought the world a branded flamethrower — it somehow tracks that Tesla is now making pickleball paddles.\n\nThe EV company launched its latest lifestyle product on Friday: a $350 pickleball paddle created in partnership with Selkirk, a sports equipment company.\n\nThe paddle, made of carbon fiber with a foam core, was \"optimized for high-performance play,\" according to the product page.\n\n\"This wasn't simply a branding exercise. It was a true engineering collaboration,\" Selkirk's co-owner and director of research and development, Tom Barnes, said in a statement about the release. \"Tesla's design group and our R&D team spent more than a year trading data, refining geometry, and stress-testing prototypes.\"\n\nA Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider that the paddle's creation was first conceptualized after a conversation at the 2023 USA Pickleball National Championships between Barnes and members of Tesla's engineering team.\n\nAfter Barnes delivered a custom batch of Tesla-themed paddles to the EV-maker's staff, Selkirk leaders visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California. While there, they connected with Javier Verdura, Tesla's global director of product design, who is an avid pickleball player, and began the design process.\n\nPrototypes were sent to Tesla for aerodynamics testing before the design was finalized.\n\nThe limited-run batch of the paddle sold out on Tesla's website in under three hours after its launch, a Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider. Plans for a restock remain unclear.\n\nWhile the pickleball paddle is Tesla's first foray into traditional, non-electrified sports equipment, the automaker does offer a line of apparel and home products, like drinkware ($30+), backpacks ($185+), and salt and pepper shakers ($65).\n\nMusk's other business ventures have also leaned into collectible merchandise, such as the Boring Company's flamethrower, which went viral in 2018.\n\nTesla's lifestyle products are not listed as a separate line item in their financial reports, and there is no publicly available evidence to suggest that they have a significant impact on the company's finances. Tesla stock closed up more than 2% on Friday, but sank slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nPickleball, which combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, has experienced explosive growth in popularity in recent years. The 2024 Pickleball Single Sport Report, released by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, found that participation has increased by 45.8% since 2023 — representing 311% growth over the past three years.\n\nIn that time, pickleball has transformed from a suburban hobby for the 55+ crowd into a popular activity and networking opportunity among Silicon Valley professionals.\n\nEntry-level equipment for the sport doesn't require a significant investment, with a basic paddle and ball running less than $50. However, since pickleball has gained traction among tech personalities like Bill Gates and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, higher-end products have crept into the market.\n\nSome Selkirk models run upward of $150, while others, like the Aero Blade 1.19, cost $299 and up. The Aero Blade features a carbon fiber frame with a foam core, similar to that of the Tesla version.\n\nThe debut of the Tesla pickleball paddle elicited split reactions on social media, with some fans of the brand celebrating its release as a clever gift opportunity ahead of the holiday season. Others were quick to criticize the price point and Selkirk's strategy to partner with Tesla, rather than a well-known pickleball player or influencer.\n\n\"Selkirks out here like 'We are going to let every signed pro walk, and then collab with the worlds biggest brands that have nothing to do with pickleball,'\" Jimmy Miller, a pickleball player and host of the '\"King of the Court\" podcast, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"Bold strategy. Curious if it pays off,\" he added. \"Tesla fans will probably sell that paddle out. Who is next? Apple? Maybe they can do a Nvidia collab that comes with shares!\"",

    "description": "\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant.\"",
    "fullText": "A six-second clip of a Tesla Optimus robot's \"suspicious tumble\" emerged on Reddit, Electrek reported, reviving skepticism about the electric vehicle manufacturer's autonomous technology.\n\nIn recent months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been laser-focused on the company's artificial intelligence and robotics endeavors. Musk has asserted that \"AI and robotics\" were the only things that can save the United States from financial doom, and that those technologies would make money obsolete.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Tesla hosted an \"Autonomy Visualized\" event at a dealership in Miami, and a user on Reddit's r/TeslaMotors shared a brief clip of Optimus' reverse face-plant.\n\nTesla Optimus\n byu/Decent_Cheesecake643 inteslamotors\n\nIn the six-second video, Optimus was seen knocking over a few plastic water bottles before toppling over backward. However, the robot's unmistakably human gesture served as a \"Wizard-of-Oz\"-like reveal of the man behind the curtain. (Click here if the embedded video does not appear.)\n\n\"Looks like the operator took off their VR headset,\" a user observed, which was the general consensus on a different Reddit thread shared two days later.\n\n\"That's exactly what happened,\" another user replied, with another possibility that a teleoperator simply noticed they had knocked over some bottles and threw up their arms in dismay, unintentionally causing the robot to lose its balance.\n\nOne Reddit comment depicting a GIF of a \"Robocop 2\" scene in which a malfunctioning Robocop prototype makes a similar gesture to lift off its helmet racked up over 17,000 likes. Electrek commenters were equally unimpressed.\n\n\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant,\" one wrote. \"Everything Tesla does with robots seems to be a disappointing disaster.\"\n\nAnyone who follows Tesla developments is deeply familiar with Musk's tendency to wildly underestimate timelines.\n\nIn 2019, he famously predicted that 1 million driverless Tesla Robotaxis would be criss-crossing American roads in 2020.\n\nWhen they finally debuted on a small scale in June, it was obvious to riders that human operators were involved — yet Robotaxi crashes also occurred at a surprising rate.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTesla's Optimus was first unveiled in 2022, but coverage of its purported capabilities often focused on the obvious human intervention. If Optimus were Tesla's sole focus, its level of autonomy would be less of a concern.\n\nHowever, Musk has long prioritized autonomous EVs over other advancements. He recently promised that Tesla drivers could soon \"text and drive\" safely, forcing law enforcement agencies to reiterate that the activity remains illegal.\n\nAmid plans to release an autonomous model called the Cybercab without seeking the necessary regulatory approvals, Tesla's struggles to make autonomous driving a reality can undermine consumer trust and discourage drivers from making their next car an EV.\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla remains the most prominent EV manufacturer; if a perception that the brand is unsafe persists, fewer EVs on the road and more tailpipe pollution could result.\n\nAfter a challenging 2025 and Tesla's Optimus-related missteps, the brand is leaning heavily on the Cybercab's debut to turn things around.\n\nThis month, Musk said Tesla's Robotaxi fleet would double in size before the year was out, but questions about its level of autonomy lingered.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Here are 4 ways Rivian just stepped deeper into Tesla's turf",
    "description": "Rivian revealed ambitious plans for fully autonomous driving, featuring an in-house chip, an in-car AI assistant, and a Tesla-like subscription model.",
    "fullText": "Rivian is all-in on autonomous driving, stepping deeper into a territory Tesla has long positioned itself to dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, at Rivian's R&D office in Palo Alto, the EV maker unveiled a road map to develop autonomous-driving capabilities for its future lineup of vehicles, including new hardware for the highly anticipated R2 — Rivian's cheapest car to date.\n\nThat road map includes a new silicon chip, designed in-house, that will power Rivian's next-generation hardware and support self-driving functions. The new hardware is expected to ship with R2 by the end of 2026, Rivian said.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been hinting at autonomous ambitions in recent years. However, since the company's first shipment of vehicles in 2021, Rivian's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) software — Driver+ and the Rivian Autonomy Platform — has been more akin to Tesla Autopilot than Full Self-Driving Supervised. Tesla's Autopilot provides lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, while FSD can recognize traffic lights, conduct turns, and drive to a destination under constant driver supervision.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens Rivian's rivalry with Tesla as both companies have expressed goals of fully autonomous driving and licensing their software platforms to other automakers.\n\nRivian's partnership with Volkswagen, announced last year, was a clear first shot at those licensing ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently balked on X that no automaker wanted to license FSD.\n\nHere are four ways Rivian is taking a page out of Tesla's playbook.\n\nRivian has been using a combination of Nvidia and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips to power various vehicle functions, including driver-assistance and infotainment systems.\n\nNow, the company is turning to in-house silicon to power its next-generation autonomous driving hardware.\n\n\"At the core of Rivian's technology roadmap is the transition to in-house silicon, designed specifically for the vision-centric physical AI,\" the company said.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the chips will be manufactured by TSMC.\n\nTesla began a production shift toward in-house chips in 2019 and has since released two iterations, AI3 and AI4. Musk has said that Tesla's next-generation chip, AI5, will be 40 times better than its predecessor.\n\nRivian's \"Gen 3 Autonomy\" hardware is under validation and is expected to be shipped with R2 by the end of 2026, the company said.\n\nWith the new chips, Rivian's explicit goal is to achieve full autonomy — that's Level 4, or the kind of self-driving technology seen in Alphabet's Waymo, in which driver supervision is not required.\n\nMusk has already made full autonomy Tesla's north star, pledging to turn every personally-owned Tesla into a robotaxi that can generate revenue.\n\nThe Tesla CEO's goals have been met with considerable skepticism, particularly due to the company's decision to abandon lidar, a sensor that many industry leaders consider essential for safety and redundancy in self-driving cars.\n\nRivian, for its part, plans to incorporate lidar into the R2 vehicle. The sensor appears to be installed within the car, just above the middle of the windshield.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the company collaborated with a third party on the \"exterior design\" of Rivian's \"lidar implementation.\"\n\nThe company did not share a timeline for launching fully autonomous driving.\n\nIn the near term, Rivian will update its ADAS with hands-free assisted driving capability. The feature won't be functional on every road, according to a press release.\n\nRivian said it will be available on \"over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada\" and can operate \"off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines.\"\n\nAt Thursday's event, Scaringe also suggested potential robotaxi ambitions.\n\n\"This also enables us to pursue opportunities in the rideshare space,\" the CEO said.\n\nRivian is following Tesla's FSD subscription model for what it's calling \"Autonomy+.\"\n\nThe software will launch \"early 2026\" and be priced at $49.99 a month or $2,500 for a one-time purchase.\n\nTesla's FSD is $99 a month or $8,000 up front.\n\nRivian said the software will be continuously updated. The \"trajectory\" for the feature will be \"point-to-point\" navigation — where users type in a destination, and the car drives itself just like FSD — as well as eyes-off driving capabilities and \"personal L4\" capabilities, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that \"hundreds of millions of miles contribute to the development of Autonomy+.\"\n\n\"This data is comprised of samples from around the US and Canada year-round, capturing diversity in both geography and seasonality,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk announced in July an integration of xAI's Grok in Tesla vehicles, providing a chatbot that drivers can talk to and, more recently, ask for directions.\n\nRivian will be following a similar playbook with \"Rivian Assistant,\" an AI voice interface that will be \"model-agnostic,\" according to the automaker.\n\n\"Our framework allows us to orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task,\" a Rivian spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said in a press release that the AI assistant can connect to third-party apps and will start with the integration of Google Calendar.\n\nThe AI assistant can also assist with vehicle diagnostics and control certain vehicle functions, such as activating the car's seat heaters.\n\nThe feature will be shipped early 2026 on Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.\n\nThe analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business.\n\n\"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"\n\nIt's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nPercoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months.\n\n\"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.\n\nPercoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.\n\nIt cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots.\n\nOne risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern.\n\n\"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"\n\nAnd while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.\n\nPercoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",

All are heavily invested in AI.\n\nNever before has so much of the economy been dependent on one technology. And despite the trillions of dollars invested, AI is yet to show a way it can sustainably turn over profits.\n\nSo what happens, asks Nosheen Iqbal, if one day the faith falters, the money stops coming in and the bottom falls out?",
