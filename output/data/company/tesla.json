    "fullText": "The novelty of eating at a diner owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off in just a few months\n\nLess than six months since it opened, Elon Musk’s Tesla Diner has the feel of a ghost town. Gone is the Optimus robot serving popcorn, gone are the carnivore-diet-inspired “Epic Bacon” strips, gone are the hours-long, hundred-person lines wrapped around the block. Even the restaurant’s all-star chef, Eric Greenspan, is gone. The Hollywood burger-and-fries shop seems like a shell of the bustling eatery it was when it opened in late July.\n\nOn a balmy Friday afternoon in December, the parking lot for Tesla car charging was, at best, half full. Inside what the company describes as a “retro-futuristic” diner, a handful of people trickled in, ordering burgers and hotdogs or asking for merch. The upstairs deck, AKA “Skypad”, was vacant except for a pair of employees stringing holiday lights. More staff was busy at work, buffing fingerprints off the chrome walls and taking out the trash, than there were customers. The diner was spotless.\n\nThe novelty of eating at a restaurant owned by the richest person in the world seems to have worn off. When the Tesla diner opened in summer, it brought in droves of the CEO’s fans and curious onlookers. But then came the onsite anti-Musk protests, noise complaints from neighbors and customers who said menu items often sold out or, when they were available, were served soggy and cold.\n\nGreenspan, a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who helped launch the Mr Beast Burger chain, told the Los Angeles Times last month that he was leaving the Tesla Diner to focus on opening a Jewish deli called Mish. According to Eater, the chef removed his previous Instagram posts referencing the Tesla Diner as a newly minted ex-boyfriend might.\n\nGreenspan has not publicly said why he left and did not return a request for comment. Tesla also did not return a request for comment.\n\nGreenspan and other California restaurateurs who praised the Tesla Diner faced pushback for supporting Musk. The Tesla CEO is seen as a polarizing figure who donated nearly $300m to get Donald Trump elected and then led the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) in its rapid and haphazard teardown of federal agencies. During a speech at Trump’s inauguration, Musk made what rights groups have described as back-to-back Nazi salutes – something repeatedly portrayed in the picket signs held by Tesla Diner protesters.\n\nMusk has been talking about the concept of a 50s-style Tesla diner in LA since at least 2018 as part of an idea to have amenities for waiting drivers connected to Supercharger stations. He touted the plans for it in 2023 as “Grease meets The Jetsons with Supercharging” and claimed the diner would launch later that year. When it finally did open in the summer of 2025, he called it “one of the coolest spots in LA” and vowed that if the concept went well Tesla would open diners in major cities around the world. So far, there is only one.\n\n“This is a pretty special diner. If you are in the LA area, it’s worth visiting,” Musk said on Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call, just two days after the diner opened. “It’s a shining beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak urban landscape.”\n\nThe diner received immense media coverage upon opening but poor reviews from restaurant critics, who described the food as forgettable and the concept as little more than a corporate branding exercise. Its menu consisted of fast-food staples like a $13.50 smash burger, AKA “Tesla Giga Burger”, and an $8 milkshake, along with more internet-coded foods like the $12 maple-glazed “Epic Bacon” strips and a small-sized $8 “Wagyu Beef Chili Cup”.\n\nA display case with Tesla merchandise featured a “levitating Cybertruck” figurine for $175 and a black hoodie emblazoned with a graphic of the diner for $95.\n\nTesla posted on X in October that it had sold 50,000 burgers since its opening – an average of a little over 700 a day. Musk proclaimed that month that the diner was a success and suggested that he would open others near Tesla offices in Palo Alto and Austin. Tesla has yet to announce any formal plans for expansion.\n\nOn social media, the wave of food influencers making TikTok and Instagram videos about the diner slowed in the months after its opening. Reviewers commenting on the $13 hotdog or posing next to the giant drive-in screens playing Star Trek are now relatively rare. Musk, who usually posts dozens of times a day on X, has only made scant mentions of the diner on the platform and didn’t address it on Tesla’s third quarter earnings call in October.\n\nThe diner also appears to have pivoted to hosting some events, including a “Holiday Bash on The Skypad” in mid-December featuring unlimited Tesla food and beverages, plus a live DJ, for $75 a ticket.\n\nAs the diner narrows its ambitions, some of the customer complaints have likewise waned. The pared down menu is fully stocked, and food came out hot and fast on the balmy Friday in December. One enthusiastic Yelp reviewer said she recently visited the diner on a Saturday night. She posted a photo of her meal, saying “the burger was solid and the fries were perfectly crispy”.\n\n“Best part was that it wasn’t crowded at all,” she added.",

    "description": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever, and one \"Big Short\" trader says it's the most overvalued stock in the market.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock is as polarizing as ever.\n\nIt's up nearly double since bottoming out last April. And those gains are happening at a time when sales are declining. Tesla isn't even the world's biggest EV-maker anymore.\n\nThe situation spotlights the growing disconnect between the company's valuation in the stock market and its ability to keep dominating the sale of EVs.\n\nBulls will shrug off those concerns and say the company's AI efforts will eventually provide the earnings juice to normalize those valuations. Bears, on the other hand, are not so forgiving.\n\nPorter Collins — the former FrontPoint Partners trader who was immortalized in \"The Big Short\" for his bet against the US housing market — fits firmly into latter camp.\n\nHe told Business Insider recently that he sees Tesla as the market's most overvalued stock.\n\n\"I think that the most obvious one in all of the S&P is Tesla,\" he said. \"I think that's the poster child of the asset class.\"\n\nHe said that while fellow Big Tech leader Nvidia trades at roughly 45 times next year's earnings forecast, Tesla currently trades at almost 300 times the 2026 projection.\n\nCollins thinks that Tesla should be valued in line with other automakers, or other Big Tech firms. He argues that it's presently in a world of its own, not being valued on the fundamentals of any specific sector.\n\n\"I honestly think Tesla is just a meme stock,\" he stated. \"People follow Elon Musk and they think he will produce generational type products in the future. He may or may not, but that's the bet right now.\"\n\nCollins doesn't necessarily consider that a bad thing. But he does think it clouds investors' ability to properly assess it.\n\n\"Meme stocks have tended to be high flyers,\" he admitted. \"Some meme stocks have come back to Earth, but others have not. GameStop and AMC eventually came back to economic reality. Tesla? We'll see.\"\n\nCollins isn't the only \"Big Short\" alumnus who feels this way about Tesla. Michael Burry has recently criticized the company's lofty valuation on his Substack, although — like Collins — he has stopped short of actually shorting the stock.",

    "fullText": "When self-driving cars make headlines, it’s usually because something went wrong — a glitch, a failure, an accident.\n\nOn a dark, isolated stretch of Highway 54 in New Mexico, Clifford Lee believes he’s alive today not because of his own reflexes — but because his Tesla Cybertruck, operating in Full Self-Driving mode, made a split-second decision for him.\n\n“I almost got killed,” Lee said. “I was shaking uncontrollably for a while.”\n\nLee was traveling northbound on a two-lane highway, cruising at about 75 miles per hour, using Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system — known as FSD — during a long road trip.\n\nAhead of him, a semi-truck approached in the opposite lane. Behind it, a pickup truck attempted a dangerous pass.\n\n“All I saw were headlights,” Lee said.\n\nWith only seconds to react, Lee realized the pickup wasn’t going to make it back into its lane in time.\n\n“I think it was like five seconds out,” he said. “Around three seconds, I realized he would not make it.”\n\nLee says he tried to steer away — but the Cybertruck was already moving.\n\nThe Cybertruck recorded the entire event. In the video you can clearly see there was no room for error. An overcorrection would’ve bounced Lee’s Cybertruck off the guardrail and possibly back into oncoming traffic.\n\nSlowed down frame by frame, the video shows the Cybertruck making a precise maneuver — avoiding what could have been a deadly head-on collision.\n\n“I’m so convinced it was FSD,” Lee said.\n\nThe only damage: a shattered side window and a broken mirror.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system relies entirely on cameras — mounted in door pillars, fenders, and around the vehicle — to interpret the world in real time.\n\n“I use it every day,” said Cybertruck owner Aaron George. “I feel so much safer with FSD.”\n\nGeorge demonstrated the system for CBS Austin, starting at the station’s parking lot and setting a destination to Mount Bonnell — a route filled with tricky merges, construction zones, narrow neighborhood streets, and blind intersections.\n\nAt one busy frontage road, the Cybertruck waited for the safest window of opportunity before merging smoothly into traffic.\n\nAt stoplights, the screen displayed every surrounding vehicle — cars, trucks, vans — even those behind the truck.\n\nAs the drive continued, the system navigated tight residential roads, avoided trash cans in the street, detected pedestrians, and cautiously inched forward at blind intersections before turning.\n\n“It’s pretty blinded over there,” George noted at one intersection. “It inched up, saw there were no cars, and made the turn.”\n\nWhen we arrived at Mount Bonnell, the Cybertruck located an open parking spot and backed in— without George ever touching the wheel.\n\n“It’s amazing,” he said. “Every iteration is mind-blowing.”\n\nTesla is currently rolling out Full Self-Driving (Supervised) version 14.\n\nFor many drivers, Full Self-Driving is about convenience. For Clifford Lee, it’s something far more personal.\n\n“I realized this is my second life already,” he said.\n\nLee believes a full-speed impact — closing at a combined speed of nearly 150 miles per hour — would have been unsurvivable.\n\n“There’s no chance I would have survived that,” he said.\n\nTesla’s Full Self-Driving system still requires driver supervision, and federal regulators continue to scrutinize the technology. But for one driver on a lonely highway in New Mexico, a decision made in a fraction of a second may have made all the difference.",

    "fullText": "Chinese auto giant BYD on Friday dethroned U.S. rival Tesla as the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles on a calendar-year basis.\n\nThe milestone caps an extraordinary rise for BYD, a company Tesla CEO Elon Musk once dismissed by laughing at their products during a 2011 Bloomberg interview.\n\nIn a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.\n\nMusk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop.\n\nDeliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\n\nTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.\n\nThe stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers.\n\n— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Tesla ended a roller coaster year with its sales going into reverse.\n\nElon Musk's automaker said on Friday that it sold 418,227 electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, down by 15.6% from the same period in 2024.\n\nIt means Tesla's annual sales have declined for the second consecutive year, and that Chinese rival BYD has surpassed Tesla for the first time in annual sales of battery-electric vehicles.\n\nWall Street analysts were expecting the company to sell around 441,000 EVs, per data compiled by Bloomberg, while Tesla released its own, more pessimistic, analyst consensus forecast of 422,850 units in an unusual move earlier this week.\n\nBYD said on Thursday that sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units in 2025. Tesla said it delivered about 1.64 million vehicles for the year.\n\nTesla recorded its first-ever annual sales decline in 2024, after years of explosive growth. The latest figures suggest the company has been hit hard by the demise of the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September.\n\nThe looming deadline saw US buyers race to snap up electric vehicles, driving record sales for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nOnce the tax credit ended, however, EV sales dropped across the board, including at Tesla's rivals Ford, Hyundai, and Kia.\n\nThe slump saw Tesla's sales hit their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the brand rolling out cheaper versions of its bestselling Model 3 and Y vehicles a month before.\n\nTesla has also faced difficulties this year in Europe and China, two of its biggest international markets.\n\nIn China, the EV giant has faced fierce competition from local rivals offering high-tech electric models at rock-bottom prices.\n\nTesla's sales have plummeted in Europe amid backlash over CEO Musk's endorsement of far-right German party AfD, with December registrations dropping 66% year-over-year in France and 44% in Spain, according to national auto association data.\n\nAnalysts previously told Business Insider that Tesla is also suffering from a stale product lineup. The company has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and the divisive pickup has been a sales disappointment.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Tesla's stock price hit a record high in December as investors expressed optimism over the automaker's robotaxi rollout.\n\nTesla launched a robotaxi service in Austin in June and has ambitious plans to expand autonomous ride-hailing to multiple cities in the US this year.\n\nMusk has said the company's future lies in its robotaxi and Optimus robot initiatives, and the Austin-based automaker is preparing to begin mass production in April of its Cybercab robotaxi, which does not have a steering wheel or pedals.\n\nIn an earnings call in October, Musk said that the looming launch of Tesla's \"unsupervised\" Full Self-Driving software would boost demand for the company's vehicles, and told investors that the robotaxi service in Austin would operate without safety monitors by the end of 2025.\n\nMusk said on December 24 that he took a ride around Austin without a safety driver, but as of Wednesday, they were still sitting inside vehicles available to the public.",

    "fullText": "The billionaire – who had no government experience – left various federal agencies in disarray while overseeing an ‘efficiency’ drive across Washington\n\nAs Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, splurged more than $250m on Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign, the US president commissioned his new ally to oversee a sweeping “efficiency” drive across the federal government.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX boss, who had no experience inside government, was tasked with eradicating waste and cutting spending as part of the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) – and was quick to stoke expectations.\n\n“I think we can do at least $2tn,” Musk declared of the potential savings during a campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City a week before Trump’s re-election.\n\nFollowing Trump’s return to office in January, these ambitious plans were swiftly on a collision course with reality. Tens of thousands of federal workers were fired, leaving agencies in disarray and triggering myriad legal challenges.\n\nJust four months into the administration, Musk abruptly announced his exit. Six months later, it was reported that Doge was no more. Musk has even said he wouldn’t do it again.\n\n“That was all complete bullshit from the beginning,” Elaine Kamarck, a former White House official and expert on government reform, told the Guardian. “The fact that they even said it and then had to go roll it way, way, way back into the low hundreds of billions, tells you they didn’t know what they were doing.”\n\nKamarck created and managed the National Performance Review, which aimed to improve efficiency and reduce costs, during the Clinton administration.\n\nAs of December, the agency’s purported savings, which reports have demonstrated are rife with errors, inaccuracies, and exaggerations, have reached $214bn.\n\nHowever much has been cut from the federal budget, the urgency surrounding Doge in its early weeks and months prompted widespread disruption, and even mistakes. Analysis by the Brookings Institution recorded 26,511 occasions where the Trump administration fired people, and then hired them back.\n\n“What they did was they sowed chaos to no avail,” said Kamarck. “Doge was done in an incredibly careless way, without regard for what the agencies did and whether and moreover, whether or not Americans liked what they did.\n\n“You can cut the government. I did it in the Clinton administration,” she added. “We cut the government by 420,000 people, but we did it over a period of seven years, and we did it in the context of mission and what we no longer needed to do, etc.\n\n“In other words, we had a plan that works with the mission of the agency. This business of coming in and moving fast and breaking things which they like to do in Silicon Valley just doesn’t work in the government.”\n\nQuestions were raised last month about whether Doge was even still operating. “That doesn’t exist,” the office of personnel management (OPM) director, Scott Kupor, told Reuters. (An account for the agency on X, formerly Twitter, disputed this claim.)\n\nBut Musk had long moved on. During a recent podcast interview with former Doge adviser Katie Miller, the tycoon described the effort he once suggested could identify $2tn in savings for the federal government as “a little bit successful”. Asked if he would do it again, he responded: “I don’t think so ... Instead of doing Doge, I would have, basically, built … worked on my companies.”\n\nHow much efficiency can be achieved from having multiple operations inside the federal government, seeking efficiencies? Philip G Joyce, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland, said Doge was “unnecessary” given the longstanding existence of the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which has logged $1.45tn in savings across over 29,000 federal operations since 2002.\n\nRussell Vought, the White House office of management and budget director and architect of the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint, said in September that he believes the GAO shouldn’t exist.\n\n“I can understand why he thinks that,” said Joyce. “Because the Government Accountability Office, as an agency of the Congress, is helping the Congress to try to hold the executive branch accountable. It’s uncomfortable to be held accountable, but that doesn’t make it bad.”\n\nRather than reinforce the balance of power between the different branches of government, Joyce argued that Doge was a mechanism to eliminate and cut things the government does that are ideologically opposed by the Trump administration – without congressional approval.\n\n“What Doge was doing was not trying to take the operations of government and make it more efficient. They were basically just trying to come in and almost randomly sort of decide that they were going to just eliminate a significant number of things that the government does,” he said. “Even upfront, it was clear that they had really no understanding of the federal budget. And then when they went into the agencies, it became even clearer.”\n\nWhen Doge descended on the Social Security Administration in February, Chuck Borges was serving as chief data officer. Musk was touting false and misleading claims alleging fraud and abuse at the agency, including claims people over 120 years old were still receiving benefits.\n\nBorges resigned in August, and filed a whistleblower complaint over how Doge left the public’s social security data exposed. “What I identified was that social security data was apparently being copied into an insecure or unsecured cloud environment, or you could characterize it as a cloud environment without independent security monitoring,” he told the Guardian. “What I was alleging was that there was a risk being put on the data by keeping it in a manner not consistent with agency policy, agency requirements and industry best practices.”\n\nBorges is now running for a state senate seat in Maryland. “I believe that if we don’t find a way to build strong, sustainable, growing communities locally, and I’d like to start with where I live, then the nation isn’t going to have a lot of seeds which it can use to grow and recover from where we are today,” he said.\n\nMany Doge staffers are now reportedly embedded inside federal agencies across government. Many of the issues it posed around transparency, and the impact of sweeping decisions, are still being fought over in court.\n\n“Doge has been operating with minimal transparency but maximal authority,” said Donald K Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), which filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Doge in February, alleging that it had failed to comply with recordkeeping and transparency laws.\n\n“There’s pretty significant misalignment in terms of how the administration claims Doge has been beneficial to the American public, and what information it wants the American public to have access to about Doge’s operations,” said Sherman. “We’ve spent months litigating because this administration does not want the public to know what Doge is doing, how Doge is operating.”\n\nApproached for comment, the White House did not provide detailed responses to questions on Doge’s record.\n\n“President Trump pledged to cut the waste, fraud, and abuse in our bloated government, and the Administration is committed to delivering on this pledge for the American people,” said spokesperson Davis Ingle.\n\nThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.\n\nIf you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.\n\nSecure Messaging in the Guardian app\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    "description": "Elon Musk made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi could achieve in 2025, including fully-autonomous driving",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has made a lot of promises for what Tesla Robotaxi would achieve by the end of 2025: fully autonomous rides for the public; expanded service areas in multiple regions; and coverage for half the US population, among other milestones.\n\nWith the year closing, here's what Tesla's ride-hailing service looks like.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 30 Teslas were operating in Austin, where the pilot launch began, offering paid rides with a safety monitor in the front passenger seat.\n\nTesla also deployed a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area earlier this year. There, a safety monitor sits behind the steering wheel due to California regulations.\n\nMusk missing deadlines is hardly new. It's called \"Elon Time.\" There's a website for it. Even the CEO himself recognizes it.\n\n\"I am pathologically optimistic with time,\" he said in May 2024. \"Have been ever since I was a kid.\"\n\nTesla investors and analysts have learned to accept this Musk quirk — just as long as the CEO delivers.\n\n\"I hear Tesla lay out the vision, then I try to listen to what the markers are to get there,\" Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst, previously told Business Insider.\n\nDays before the year ends, Tesla employees have shared videos on X of what appear to be fully autonomous rides in Austin with no in-car safety monitor. Musk said he took a ride as well and noted \"perfect driving.\"\n\nIn the meantime, here's everything Musk said Tesla Robotaxi would achieve in 2025.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHere's one that was quickly debunked.\n\nDuring an earnings call in April, Musk teased the launch of Tesla Robotaxi and said the company was \"on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously in Austin in June,\" following \"many other cities in the US by the end of this year.\"\n\nThat didn't happen. Tesla Robotaxi was launched with safety monitors in the front passenger seat of the Model Ys.\n\nThe monitors are there to stop the rides if they detect unwanted driving behavior, Business Insider reported after using Tesla Robotaxi in Austin.\n\nIn October, Musk said that he expects Robotaxi to be in about \"eight to 10 metro areas by the end of the year,\" including Nevada, Florida, and Arizona, pending regulatory approval.\n\nTesla received permits to operate a ride-hailing service in the three states mentioned. The company also appears to be hiring for Robotaxi-related jobs across the US.\n\nHowever, as of Wednesday, the only paid service available to the public is limited to the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin.\n\nMusk told the All-In podcast also in October that Tesla will \"probably\" have \"a thousand cars or \n\nSo far, there's little evidence to suggest that Tesla is operating with that many vehicles in either region.\n\nThe Robotaxi Tracker, which tracks fleet size through crowdsourced data, shows that there are roughly 35 vehicles in Austin and around 130 vehicles in the Bay Area.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported this month that Tesla registered 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers for its ride-hailing service.\n\nDuring Tesla's second-quarter earnings call in July, Musk said Tesla will likely have robotaxis operating for \"half of the population of the US by the end of the year.\"\n\nThe caveats were that the goal is subject to regulatory approval and that the company wants to be \"very, very cautious.\"\n\nMusk said in Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October that the company expects to remove the safety drivers in \"large parts of Austin\" by the end of 2025.\n\nA safety monitor still sits inside Tesla Robotaxi as of Wednesday, but it appears the company is making progress toward that goal.\n\n\"A Tesla with no safety monitor in the car and me sitting in the passenger seat took me all around Austin on Sunday with perfect driving,\" Musk said in an X post on December 24.\n\nThis is separate from Robotaxi, but FSD, or Full Self-Driving, is the key technology that will underpin Tesla's autonomous ride-hailing service.\n\nIn April, Musk said Tesla would deliver FSD Unsupervised for personally-owned vehicles by the end of the year in \"many cities in the US.\"\n\nCurrently, drivers are required to pay attention to the roads to keep FSD activated.\n\nMusk said earlier this month that a software update allowed drivers to use their phones in certain traffic conditions.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistar Barr tried it. Police don't recommend it.",

    "fullText": "Tesla endured tough year in part thanks to some consumers’ distaste for Elon Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics\n\nTesla has taken the unusual step of publishing sales forecasts that suggest 2025 deliveries will be lower than expected and future years’ sales will be well below targets set by its chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nThe US electric vehicle maker published figures from analysts suggesting it will announce 423,000 deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2025, in a new “consensus” section on its investor website. That would represent a 16% decline from the final quarter of 2024.\n\nThe estimates suggested that Tesla would deliver 1.64m cars in 2025 as a whole, down from 1.79m in 2024. Deliveries are then estimated to rise to 1.75m in 2026 and 3m in 2029.\n\nMusk claimed at a shareholder meeting in November that the company was aiming to produce 4m cars a year by the end of 2027.\n\nTesla’s shares are valued at $1.4tn (£1.04tn), making it worth more than the next 30 carmakers combined despite its output being less than a fifth of that of Japan’s Toyota. Musk’s Tesla shares, as well as his stake in the rocket company SpaceX, have made him by far the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $623bn, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHowever, much of Tesla’s valuation has been based on shareholder hopes that Musk will lead the carmaker to become the global leader in self-driving technology and robotics more generally.\n\nWhen it comes to actual sales, Tesla has endured a tough year in part thanks to distaste among some consumers for Musk’s embrace of rightwing politics.\n\nIn 2024, Musk was the biggest donor to the election campaign of Donald Trump and then launched an effort to cut government spending with the Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge). His alliance with the US president did not survive the summer, with Trump instead scrapping buyer subsidies worth $7,500 a vehicle and slashing supportive regulations for electric cars.\n\nThe estimates published by Tesla this week are lower than other compilers have suggested. An average of forecasts by investment banks compiled by Bloomberg suggested that Tesla would deliver 440,907 vehicles in the fourth quarter.\n\nInvestment banks often publish sales and profit forecasts for large companies in order to judge the prospects for share price movements. “Missing” consensus forecasts often result in share price declines, and vice versa for a “beat”.\n\nThe forecasts for later years are also far below Musk’s stated targets. In November, Musk said the carmaker was trying to increase production by 50% by the end of 2026, and to produce 4m cars by the end of 2027, according to a transcript compiled by AlphaSense, a data company. However, the forecasts suggest the carmaker will hit the 3m mark only in 2029.\n\nTesla shareholders in November approved a $1tn compensation plan for Musk, in part on the basis of Tesla delivering 20m cars. Of those cars, 10m will have to have active subscriptions for “full self-driving”, its autonomous software, in order for Musk to qualify for the payment.",

He replied that he isn't short.\n\nThe question was timely, given the EV-maker this week took the unusual move of releasing sales forecasts that are weaker than many expected.\n\nBurry's answer might come as a surprise to some, considering the investor took to his Substack on Tuesday to criticize Tesla.\n\n\"Tesla sales falling. It is a ridiculously overvalued stock,\" he wrote.\n\nBut he then added a cautionary note about how risky it is to short.\n\n\"Shorting it has been dangerous, and the puts are expensive. So maybe not much to do here for most people, except sell it if they can,\" he said.\"\n\nDespite his reluctance to short now, Burry has bet against Tesla stock previously.

A few months later, though, he closed it out.\n\nBurry isn't the only investor of 'Big Short' fame to take this stance on Tesla. Danny Moses, a former trader from Steve Eisman's former FrontPoint Partners, also bet against the stock in previous years, although he closed out his position in 2024, noting that shorting a stock that isn't trading on fundamentals is extremely difficult.\n\nMoses recently told Business Insider that he doesn't think this is the time to bet against mega-cap tech, despite valuation concerns. He added that he would need to see earnings growth not go negative but decelerate in order for him to feel comfortable shorting these companies.\n\nPorter Collins, one of Moses' partners, revealed that he sees Tesla stock as highly overpriced, noting that he considers it to simply be a meme stock driven primarily by retail speculation and adoration for Musk.",

    "fullText": "How the tech CEO and ‘Dogefather’ made a mess of the year – from an apparent Nazi salute during his White House tenure to Tesla sales slumps and Starship explosions\n\nThe year of 2025 was dizzying for Elon Musk. The tech titan began the year holding court with Donald Trump in Washington DC. As the months ticked by, one public appearance after another baffled the US and the world. Musk appeared to give a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration, staunchly championed a 19-year-old staffer nicknamed “Big Balls,” denied reports of being a drug addict while advising the president, and showed up at a White House press conference with a black eye – all in the first half of the year alone.\n\n“Elon’s attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you’re an incrementalist, you just won’t get your rocket to the moon,” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, told Vanity Fair in an expansive interview earlier this month. “And so with that attitude, you’re going to break some china.”\n\nMusk saw huge, multibillion-dollar wins and equally large losses in business this year. In his dealings with federal agencies, he was able to secure new enormous government contracts and expand SpaceX’s operations. With Tesla, he was approved for a pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire even as the company’s global sales plunged. At the same time, Musk and his businesses were the target of protests, lawsuits and an exodus of high-level executives. He ended the year with a fortune worth some $600bn.\n\nIn the background, his turbulent personal life continued to provide surprises. Rightwing influencer Ashley St Clair sued Musk in February for custody of their five-month-old baby, revealing that Musk had fathered a 13th publicly documented child, for a total of now 14 children. As Musk made regular attacks in posts on X against transgender people, his estranged daughter Vivian Wilson, who is trans, was featured in New York magazine and modeled at New York fashion week. And the New York Times published a lengthy investigation into Musk’s father, Errol Musk, who was accused of child sex abuse.\n\nThe relationship that dominated Musk’s public life, however, was his friendship and falling out with Trump. On the day of his inauguration, Trump empowered Musk to gut government agencies, which the tech billionaire did with zeal and abandon. But by June, Musk and Trump had broken up. Their bromance burned hot and fast. On one of his final days as a special government employee, Musk lashed out at the president on his social media platform, X, saying: “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files.” The post has since been deleted.\n\nThough the drama surrounding Musk was frequently absurd and unpredictable, it was also consequential. This was a year when the richest person in the world obtained new levels of wealth and power that few in history have ever approached, one that demonstrated the depth of his global influence as he sought to advance his rightwing agenda and grow his tech empire.\n\nWhile Musk had stayed away from Washington DC after the Epstein post, the billionaire was invited back in November for a White House dinner in honor of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. By the end of the year, Trump and Musk seemed to have made amends. When asked by Fox Business this month if Musk was back in his circle of friends, Trump suggested the two could have a future together again.\n\n“Well, I really don’t know,” Trump said. “I mean, I like Elon a lot.”\n\nMusk expressed more regret than the president over the course the year had taken. When his former aide Katie Miller asked whether he would lead the unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) again, knowing what he knows now, he responded: “Instead of doing Doge, I would have worked on my companies. And they wouldn’t have been burning the cars.”\n\nAfter becoming a Republican mega-donor and campaigning for Trump during the 2024 election, Musk began the year on a high as he prepared to enter the administration as the de facto leader of Doge. He immediately set a tone of chaos and outrage that would persist for the length of his time in the White House.\n\nDuring Trump’s internationally televised inauguration event in January, Musk issued what many people interpreted as back-to-back fascist-syle salutes as he concluded a speech. Rights groups condemned the gesture while Musk attempted to dismiss the criticism as “dirty tricks” from legacy media. The reaction was so intense and negative that some Tesla owners sold their cars in response to Musk’s gestures.\n\nMusk spurred further condemnation from Jewish groups after appearing virtually at a rally for Germany’s far-right AfD party. The Tesla CEO told the crowd via livestream that Germans should not focus on “past guilt” and “move beyond that” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nAs Musk started his work with Doge, the controversies and backlash against his politics grew. The newly formed bureau operated first as a loose collection of appointed staffers and then subsumed the US Digital Service. It rapidly moved to gut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs across the government even as ethics watchdogs launched lawsuits accusing Musk’s group of violating privacy and transparency laws, some of which continue today. Musk personally bragged about feeding the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the world’s largest single provider of humanitarian aid, “into the woodchipper”. The cuts would cause the abrupt cancellation of aid programs worldwide, disrupt HIV/Aids treatment for millions and result in children starving to death in a hunger crisis that experts agree was needless.\n\nAt the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Musk appeared to relish his new role as the Trump administration’s demolition man. He brandished a chainsaw on stage and told the audience “I am become meme!” as he waved it about in sunglasses and a gold chain. In March, he once again began to pour more money into Republican causes by holding rallies and handing out $1m checks to support a conservative judge in Wisconsin’s supreme court race.\n\nThe pushback against Musk’s political blitz soon began to frustrate his ambitions, however. Judges that ruled Doge’s activities illegal or issued temporary injunctions infuriated Musk, who called for the widespread impeachment of any “activist judges” who opposed his agenda. His preferred candidate in the Wisconsin supreme court race lost by a significant margin, a sign to some in Washington that Musk’s presence had potentially become politically toxic.\n\nMusk left his role in the White House in May amid disputes around his pick for who would head Nasa and clashes over Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Upon his exit, he signalled that his time with politics had come to a close, claiming he would reduce his campaign finance contributions in the future and return to his businesses. Yet he quickly put himself back in the spotlight with his public battle with Trump on social media and vowed he would start a third political party called the “America party,” a promise that has yet to come to meaningful fruition.\n\nMusk’s political leanings continued to drift rightward, allying himself via near-constant posts on X interacting with far-right activists such as Tommy Robinson and telling Joe Rogan that “it should be OK to have white pride”. He led an online grievance campaign in early October against the Anti-Defamation League, the country’s most prominent Jewish advocacy group, claiming that it “hates Christians” and suggesting that their documenting of extremism encouraged murder. Although no longer in the administration, his extreme conservative takes on immigration, race and politics have persisted as prominent features of his public identity.\n\nThe year in Musk’s businesses offered the billionaire even larger truckloads of money than before, despite facing intense controversy and competition.\n\nUnlike other tech moguls, who typically helm one company at a time, Musk sits astride several corporations. He controls the rocket company SpaceX and the tunneling and brain implant companies, Boring Inc and Neuralink, respectively. Musk also runs the social media company X, which he bought for a second time this year via his artificial intelligence company xAI. Then there’s Tesla, his electric car company.\n\nOf all his enterprises, Tesla especially courted attention this year, as people enraged by Musk’s work with Doge focused their attention on the carmaker’s showrooms. Across the country, protesters marched at ongoing “Tesla Takedown” events. One sign at a San Francisco protest in March read: “Burn your swastikar before it burns you.” Dozens of Tesla cars and charging stations nationwide were set on fire as one-off vandals protested the billionaire.\n\nThough Trump and Musk hosted what amounted to a Tesla sales event on the lawn of the White House in March, Tesla saw its sales slump worldwide.\n\nLawsuits against Tesla also piled up throughout the year. In August, a Florida jury awarded more than $200m to victims of a deadly crash involving its Autopilot technology in August. And in California, two separate lawsuits were filed in October over three teenagers who were killed when a Cybertruck caught on fire and locked them inside. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also opened several investigations into the carmaker over safety issues.\n\nWhile Tesla’s plunge in profits continued throughout the year, that didn’t stop the company’s shareholders from approving a pay package for Musk – the largest corporate payout in history – that could catapult him to the status of the world’s first trillionaire.\n\nTesla’s year finished with a blow from California’s department of motor vehicles. The agency said the car company had misled consumers and exaggerated the capabilities of its Autopilot technology. If Tesla doesn’t “remedy the situation” within 90 days, the DMV said earlier in December, the company will be banned from selling cars in the state, its biggest US market.\n\nWith SpaceX, Musk was able to curry favor with the federal government. Not only did his Starlink satellites continue to dominate the Earth’s atmosphere – the SpaceX subsidiary operates the vast majority of all satellites in orbit – but the Federal Aviation Administration and the air force gave SpaceX the go-ahead to increase rocket launches in Florida, Texas and California. This came despite the company’s massive Starship, a 400ft machine that Musk hopes to one day fly to Mars, repeatedly blowing up and showering shrapnel across the Caribbean. One such explosion prompted legal action from Mexico, which said the debris harmed thousands of endangered sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nMusk also consolidated his social media and artificial intelligence companies this year. In March, he announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock transaction that he said valued X at $33bn. Both companies are privately held.\n\nxAI makes the Grok chatbot, which is integrated into X. The chatbot had countless meltdowns in the second year since its release. It pushed conspiracy theories about “white genocide”, claimed Trump won the 2020 election and spewed numerous antisemitic claims, once referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. Nevertheless, Musk was able to seal a $200m contract from the Department of Defense to integrate Grok into federal government tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk’s xAI datacenters in Memphis, Tennessee, were accused of polluting historically Black neighborhoods. The company had moved in dozens of portable methane gas generators to power the facilities, initially without permits, which brought several protests and a pending lawsuit from the NAACP.\n\nNeuralink, which operates in relative secrecy compared with Musk’s other businesses, accelerated the tests of its brain chips in 2025. The company says its product allows a person limited control of a computer via their thoughts. After announcing its first successful implantation in 2024, the company announced in September that it had completed the procedure in 12 patients.\n\nThroughout the year, top executives fled the uproar involved in managing Musk’s companies. Linda Yaccarino departed as X’s CEO, as did its advertising chief. xAI lost its co-founder, chief financial officer and lead lawyer. Likewise, Tesla saw several executive exits, including the vice-president of North American sales, the director of the battery team, the head of the “Optimus” robot project and several leaders of the company’s various car divisions.\n\nMusk, whose life is frequently animated by grievances and breakups, had a banner year for high-profile fights, even by his own standards. Longstanding feuds reignited while his close relationship with Trump imploded in full public view, all as he posted a steady stream of attacks against immigrants, the trans community, the media, Wikipedia and a host of other targets on X, where he boasts 230 million followers.\n\nMusk began the year by accusing the government of South Africa, his birth country, of anti-white racism when he sought approval for his Starlink internet provider to operate in the country. It was part of a series of spats Musk would have with governments abroad and world leaders, including declaring that the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, was “complicit in the rape of Britain” in one of his anti-immigration tirades.\n\nAs Musk picked fights internationally, he also became a combative presence during his time within the Trump administration. Tensions with other administration officials resulted in reports of tense meetings in the Oval Office and a loud, near-physical yelling match between him and treasury secretary Scott Bessent in the halls of the White House. Transportation secretary Sean Duffy became another adversary in a clash over the future of Nasa, with Musk calling him “Sean Dummy” on X amid a string of other insults.\n\nEven Musk and Trump’s formerly close friendship soured, as the president pushed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act that removed tax credits for electric vehicles and threatened to harm Tesla’s already flagging sales. Musk lashed out at Trump on Twitter in June, saying that the bill’s addition to the deficit would destroy the work Doge had done. The deterioration in their relationship culminated in Musk accusing the president of having ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump, in turn, insinuated he could cancel Musk’s government contracts and said his most prominent financial backer had “lost his mind”.\n\nThe messy, public breakup between Musk and Trump marked the end of the Tesla CEO’s time as self-described “first buddy” to the president. Although the two have entered a period of rapprochement in recent months, Musk is far from the constant presence at Trump’s side that he was on the campaign trail.\n\nMusk’s pivot back to his tech empire allowed him to refocus on other grudges, including against Sam Altman, his former OpenAI business partner turned rival. Musk added to his series of lawsuits against Altman’s AI company with a case in August that alleged Apple and OpenAI were engaging in anticompetitive conduct, an accusation that OpenAI described as part of Musk’s “pattern of harassment” against the firm. The two traded barbs on X, which included fighting over whose posts were getting more views.\n\nOne of Musk’s final feuds of the year came from a more unusual source – famed 87-year-old author Joyce Carol Oates, whose cutting observation about him on X received more than 5.6m views.\n\n“So curious that such a wealthy man never posts anything that indicates that he enjoys or is even aware of what virtually everyone appreciates – scenes from nature, pet dog or cat, praise for a movie, music, a book (but doubt that he reads); pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports, acclaim for a favorite team; references to history,” Oates posted in November.\n\nA day later, after Musk made a show of enthusiastically replying to several clips of movies on X, he responded to Oates’s critique.\n\n“Oates is a liar and delights in being mean,” Musk posted. “Not a good human.”",

    "fullText": "Tesla had a surprise Christmas present for investors this year: more bad news about its EV business.\n\nElon Musk's automaker published a press release on Monday with a consensus of analyst predictions for the company's latest quarterly sales, the first time it has publicly given Wall Street such a heads-up.\n\nThe delivery consensus, which is a compilation of predictions from analysts selected by Tesla, estimated that the EV giant sold 422,850 vehicles in the last three months of 2025, around 14.6% fewer than the same period last year.\n\nThat's lower than Wall Street's wider expectations. Analysts were expecting Tesla to sell 440,907 EVs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nIt's also a surprising move from Tesla, which typically does not issue public communications ahead of critical sales announcements.\n\nTesla, which is expected to report its latest quarterly sales as soon as Friday, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"This is highly unusual for Tesla to send out a press release with quarterly consensus delivery estimates,\" said Gary Black, managing partner at Future Fund, which sold its Tesla holdings in May.\n\nBlack wrote in the Tuesday post on X that the release suggested Tesla's Q4 sales were lower than the Bloomberg consensus and were, in his view, likely closer to 420,000.\n\nTesla's stock price hit a record high this month amid investor optimism over the company's robotaxi push, but the Cybertruck maker's core EV business has had a difficult year.\n\nTesla was hit hard by the collapse in electric car sales after the $7,500 federal tax credit expired in September.\n\nThe company's US sales reportedly fell to their lowest level since 2022 in November, despite the launch of cheaper versions of Tesla's bestselling Model 3 and Y EVs.\n\nThings haven't gone much better outside the US. Tesla has been buffeted by fierce competition from local rivals in China, where an army of EV startups has rolled out high-tech electric vehicles at rock-bottom prices.\n\nIn Europe, meanwhile, the US automaker's sales have collapsed nearly 30% so far this year amid backlash over Musk's political interventions.\n\nThe slump has left Tesla facing a race against time to avoid its second consecutive annual sales decline.\n\nTesla has rolled out a range of incentives in the US and is pushing to introduce its Full Self-Driving tech in China and Europe, but the surprise delivery consensus estimated that Tesla will end the year having sold over 100,000 fewer EVs than in 2024.",

    "description": "In four years, this humble EV saved its owners tens of thousands in fuel costs.",
    "fullText": "The Tesla Model 3 is one of the most popular electric cars in the world.\n\nIt’s particularly popular among big city taxi drivers.\n\nThis rear-wheel drive Model 3 Long Range used to be a taxi, and in just four years, it has racked up no fewer than 238,000 miles.\n\nA recent Consumer Reports study found that used Tesla EVs are at the bottom of the list when it comes to reliability, but there’s some nuance there, and it’s important. CR said that cars made between 2016 and 2021 are the worst offenders, as Tesla was trying to ramp up production any way it could, including using assembly tents.\n\nStarting in 2021, things improved significantly, and it’s clear as day when looking at the blue Model 3 showcased in the RSymons video embedded below. This humble 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range had a rough life as a taxi in the United Kingdom, and it racked up an impressive number of miles in just four years: 238,000, to be precise.\n\nAfter so much abuse, any car would have some faults pop up, and this Tesla is no different. But the severity and costs to repair all the issues are undoubtedly much lower than on a comparable gas-powered car.\n\nFirst things first, the ex-taxi Tesla still has its original high-voltage battery, original rear electric motor, original brakes, original bodywork and original windows. That’s mighty impressive, but it gets better still. Except for the steering wheel, which has seen better days and should probably be replaced sooner rather than later, the interior is in great shape after so many miles and passenger rides. The same goes for the bodywork.\n\nGetting back to the big battery, it’s still going strong, with a reported 85.5% state of health, which practically means the car can achieve 85.5% of the range it had on its first day.\n\nThat’s all good news, but the repairs and maintenance costs are where things get interesting. So far, this Tesla Model 3 Long Range has never broken down, and most of the money was spent on normal maintenance items. It’s now on its seventh set of tires, which seems a bit daunting.\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nIt had several bushes replaced, including the rear motor mounts, and the pedestrian warning sound speaker failed at 232,000 miles. In total, the car’s two owners have spent the equivalent of $7,566 (£5,603), including tires, wiper blades, cabin air filters, suspension components and labor.\n\nThat’s not really impressive, but the car makes up for the maintenance costs by saving money on fuel. In total, this Model 3 used 92.6 megawatt-hours of energy, with 28.2 MWh coming from regenerative braking alone. The car used 64,422 kilowatt-hours of payable electricity, and with the average price of $0.17/kWh in the United States, it means that it cost the equivalent of $10,951 to recharge. That’s $2,738 per year or $0.04/mile.\n\nThe fact that the Tesla Model 3 is very efficient helps a lot, with this particular car averaging an impressive 4.2 miles/kWh since February. But there you have it. You might not love Tesla as a brand–or its outspoken CEO–but there’s no denying that the cars it makes are hard to beat.\n\nUsed Tesla EVs Are A Bargain. Reliability Isn't Their Strong Suit\n\n'Absolutely Relentless': What Tesla Had To Learn From Tearing Down Chinese EVs\n\nTesla May Add CarPlay.

    "description": "Tesla sales in Europe have plunged to a three-year low, part of a wider decline. However, its stock remains well-positioned—for now.",
    "fullText": "According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) November report on EU car registrations, the figure for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) decreased 34.2% to 12,130. For the first 11 months of the year, they were down 38.8% to 129,024. The declines are part of a larger problem that runs from China to the United States. It also shows the extent to which the company’s strong stock performance this year is based on founder and CEO Elon Musk insisting that Tesla is not a car company but an artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicle, and robotics company.\n\nTesla’s U.S. sales dropped 23% to a three-year low of 39,800 in November, Reuters reports. Sales in China, the world’s largest EV market by far, also signaled trouble. According to Barron’s, “In November, the electric-vehicle maker sold just over 73,000 cars in China, down almost 1% year over year, according to industry data tracked by Citi analyst Jeff Chung.”\n\nTesla’s problem in the European Union is worse than it first seems. Registrations for BYD vehicles were up 235.2% to 16,158. For the year, the figure increased by 240% to 110,715. BYD, the world’s largest EV company, is Tesla’s biggest rival. The Chinese company has charged into countries outside its home market.\n\nTesla’s stock has shaken off the bad news about car sales. It is up 20% this year to about $485. What is more impressive is that its shares traded at $217 in March. This was primarily due to Musk’s involvement with President Trump’s effort to downsize the U.S. government, which eventually led to a falling out between the two. Tesla is the world’s eighth most valuable company, with a market cap of $1.61 trillion.\n\nTesla has begun testing its self-driving robotaxi in Austin and aims to roll out tests in Nevada, Arizona, and Florida. However, it needs to contend with other operators in the same space, led by Alphabet’s Waymo. Legacy car manufacturers, including Ford and GM, are also launching products of their own.\n\nTesla’s robotics claim is impossible to evaluate. Its humanoid robot, Optimus, has not had an impressive debut.\n\nIf investors ever return to viewing Tesla as a car company, the stock is in trouble.\n\nTesla Stock Price Prediction and Forecast 2025–2030",

    "description": "The Cybertruck has been on sale in the US for nearly two years, but Tesla has shown no signs of brining its most divisive EV across the Atlantic.",
    "fullText": "Tesla fans in Europe are still waiting for the company's most divisive product.\n\nThe Cybertruck has been on sale in the US for nearly two years, becoming both a status car and a target for anti-Elon Musk protests, but Tesla has shown no sign of bringing it across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel frame and razor-sharp edges fall foul of a bunch of European regulations, and efforts to import the truck into Europe have sparked political backlash and led to Cybertrucks being seized by police.\n\nRaven Seeholzer is trying to change that.\n\nThe founder of used Tesla marketplace Teslab and his team have spent the past year tearing apart a fleet of Cybertrucks in their workshop in Basel, Switzerland, and Seeholzer now believes they are tantalizingly close to making the \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup road-legal in the country.\n\n\"We're in the final stage of getting it road legal here. We just wanted to bring this crazy car to European roads and show everybody that it's safe,\" he told Business Insider in an interview in October.\n\nSeeholzer has run Teslab since 2018, but his quest to bring the Cybertruck to Switzerland began last year, after he realized it would likely take Tesla years to navigate the regulatory and logistical hurdles to start building Cybertrucks in Europe.\n\nOther attempts to bring the truck across the Atlantic have largely ended in failure. One custom-wrapped vehicle was seized by police in the UK in January after they concluded it was not road-legal in the country.\n\nAnother imported to the UK by YouTuber and luxury car dealer Yianni Charalambous quickly became embroiled in a spate of issues, with local politicians calling for the vehicle to be seized by police.\n\nCharalambous, who had intended to modify the pickup to make it road-legal in the UK, later said he planned to leave the UK and take his Cybertruck with him.\n\nLast year, a modified Cybertruck apparently registered in Czechia sparked criticism from campaigners and road safety advocates, who sent a letter to authorities calling for Cybertrucks to be banned from European roads.\n\nSeeholzer told Business Insider that many of the Cybertrucks imported into Europe so far had not been properly registered and had only minor modifications. Teslab, which has a fleet of five imported Cybertrucks in its Swiss workshop, has essentially rebuilt its prototype pickups from the ground up, he said.\n\nAccording to Seeholzer, the Cybertruck's famously sharp edges — which left some early owners with cuts — were the biggest issue.\n\nEuropean regulations do not allow vehicles with sharp edges that could harm pedestrians, so Teslab had to cover them with rubber and build a new front bumper to improve the vehicle's crash protection.\n\nTeslab's team of engineers also had to overhaul the Cybertruck's electrical wiring to make it compatible with European regulations, a process Seeholzer said involved essentially \"re-engineering\" the pickup.\n\n\"The car was pretty much fully apart,\" he said.\n\nSince then, the modified Cybertruck has undergone a grueling regime of government tests in Switzerland to be registered as road-legal.\n\nSeeholzer said the vehicle had passed most of the major hurdles to get approved, adding that it was a \"matter of time\" before Teslab's first Cybertruck was registered in the country.\n\nThe rest of Europe may have to wait, however — Switzerland is not a member of the European Union, and Seeholzer admitted that getting approval in the EU would be a lengthy process.\n\nDespite Europe's cautious approach to the Cybertruck, the demand seems to be there. Seeholzer said that Teslab had already sold three of its five Cybertrucks and had received around 400 preorders as of October.\n\nHe added that weight regulations meant that the first few European Cybertruck owners would have to treat their trucks as a \"lifestyle\" vehicle and avoid traditional truck activities.\n\n\"In Switzerland, the maximum weight for a car is three and a half thousand kilograms. The [modified] Cybertruck is a bit under it, which means you cannot load too much,\" he said.\n\nWeighing in at 3.5 tons, the pickup will be a tight squeeze on European roads, which are often far narrower than in the US. Its sharp edges and 0-60mph time of 2.6 seconds have also led some experts to compare it to a guided missile on wheels.\n\nBruno Dvorský thinks otherwise. The cofounder of Cybertruck.cz, the company behind the Cybertruck, registered in Czechia last year, told Business Insider in October he had imported another Cybertruck into the country and planned to register it before crashing it earlier this year.\n\nDvorský said Cybertruck.cz had added silicone coverings to blunt the Cybertruck's sharp edges, swapped out its red lights for yellow ones that comply with local rules, and added reversing lights.\n\nHe argued that the Cybertruck is no less dangerous than other large pickups already available in Europe, and said detractors were \"bicycle riders\" who lived \"small\" lives and were jealous of the vehicle.\n\n\"It's okay, but don't hate on other things,\" said Dvorský.\n\nIn September, the US Army Customs Agency said that Germany had denied requests for service members to bring their Cybertrucks into the country because the vehicle \"deviates significantly\" from EU regulations.\n\nThe agency said the Cybertruck violated European rules banning vehicles from having sharp edges and requiring speed limiters on anything weighing over 3.5 tons.\n\nIn 2020, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla would likely eventually build a smaller version of the pickup for global markets like Europe and China. There's been no sign that Tesla has any plans to do this, and the brand's sales have cratered in Europe this year amid backlash against Musk.\n\n\"When anyone looks at the facts and the applicable rules, it's clear the Cybertruck is illegal in Europe,\" James Nix, a policy manager at European think-tank Transport & Environment, which was among the signatories of the letter protesting the Czech Cybertruck, told Business Insider in October.\n\nNix said that he expects further attempts to put Cybertrucks on European roads to be \"discontinued\" in the wake of Germany's decision, adding that it would likely be impossible for anyone who imported a Cybertruck into Europe to get the necessary insurance.\n\nWould-be European Cybertruck owners do have one unlikely ally: the Trump administration. After the US president imposed a barrage of tariffs on the EU earlier this year, the two superpowers unveiled a framework for a trade deal in August that included a commitment to standardize vehicle regulations.\n\nIn October, a group of European cities, non-profits, and safety campaigners sent a letter to European regulators urging them not to accept US standards, warning that it could lead to Cybertruck-style vehicles on European roads.\n\nSeeholzer said he hoped Teslab's plan to make the Cybertruck road-legal in Europe would change the perception of Tesla's most controversial EV.\n\nHe added that previous efforts to get the Cybertruck into Europe, some of which have used unmodified imported vehicles, have done more harm than good.\n\n\"Nobody tried to really do something to change the car. They just did maybe things on the edges, maybe changed a few things on the lights, but nobody went all in,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is resorting to one of the oldest tricks in the book, robbing Peter to pay Paul, to boost demand for Cybertrucks.\n\nElectrek reported on how Musk is using one of his companies, SpaceX, to help make up for a massive shortfall of a market for the controversial Cybertruck.\n\nTesla is facing challenges selling even 20,000 Cybertrucks annually, far below Musk's initial projections of 500,000, per Electrek's analysis. As a result, Tesla is left with large stockpiles of the vehicles even as they've heavily reduced their production.\n\nMaking a small dent in the inventory is SpaceX. The company has already bought over 1,000 Cybertrucks with room to double its fleet. An X user shared a video of a lot teeming with the vehicles.\n\nAt a starting retail price of $80,000, SpaceX's purchases could add up to anywhere between $80 million to $160 million in sales for Tesla.\n\nAs Electrek pointed out, there is nothing illegal about Musk's machinations here. Still, essentially having to bail out a failing product isn't good news for Tesla nor the best move for SpaceX.\n\nInvestors certainly should be concerned that Musk's moves here are self-serving. There's also the matter of SpaceX receiving large help from the government, and then turning around and buying Cybertrucks.\n\n\"In other words, government subsidies that were meant to get us back to the moon are being used to buy unsellable trucks that look like big dumpsters,\" a frustrated commenter on Electrek opined.\n\nMusk's struggles in moving Cybertrucks provide another example of overpromising and underdelivering. Before it was released, the vehicle had over one million reservations. Only a mere 60,000 of those were converted into sales.\n\nDo you think America should produce more car parts than it does now?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nElectrek chalked up that failure to consumers picking up on a bait-and-switch from Tesla after unveiling their 2019 prototype. The actual Cybertruck is more expensive, has less range, and boasts fewer attractive features.",

    "description": "\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\"",
    "fullText": "A passerby noticed an unexpected passenger peering out the window of a parked Tesla — a puppy. While such a sight is often worrying, a unique Tesla feature put their mind at ease.\n\n\"Spotted the cutest floof,\" a Facebook user shared in a Dogspotting group. The Tesla's touchscreen reads, \"My driver will be back soon,\" and displays the internal temperature of the electric vehicle as 22 degrees Celsius (around 72 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nWhile leaving a pet in a car may not seem dangerous, temperatures can heat up quickly, particularly on a hot day. Analysis from Total.vet found that the majority of heat-related pet deaths occurred when the animal's owners left them trapped inside hot vehicles.\n\nBecause of this, California and other states have laws allowing rescues under certain conditions. However, this can lead to unnecessarily broken glass if a vehicle is running remotely, leaving the pet in a safe and comfortable environment.\n\nTesla's \"Dog Mode\" ingeniously eliminates the potential for misunderstanding. Other Facebook users were impressed by the adorable display.\n\n\"One of the reasons I want a Tesla!\" one commenter shared.\n\n\"That Tesla feature omg. I hate them but I'd buy it specifically for my dogs,\" another said.\n\nAs evidenced by the fact that this Facebook post is a couple of years old, Tesla has been a polarizing brand for years. Anti-EV sentiment fueled by misinformation has played a role, while CEO Elon Musk's political activities and social media feuds have turned the company into a lightning rod for criticism in 2025, even contributing to a sales slump in key markets.\n\nMore broadly, though, demand for EVs remains robust.\n\nTesla itself even delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter as consumers rushed to take advantage of expiring EV tax credits in the U.S.\n\nEVs are shockingly cheaper to power up, particularly if you charge at home.\n\nIn fact, you could save hundreds of dollars per year. Qmerit offers instant, free installation estimates for Level 2 chargers.\n\nWould you rather have a Tesla or a Corvette?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nReady to maximize your savings associated with driving an EV? Try charging with your own energy rather than relying on the main grid. TCD's Solar Explorer can save you up to $10,000 on solar. EnergySage, one of TCD's Solar Explorer partners, makes it easy to obtain and compare competitive quotes from vetted installers.\n\nAnd whereas gas-powered cars spew toxic pollution responsible for millions of premature deaths every year — not to mention an overheating planet making things more dangerous for humans and pets alike — electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions.\n\nIn the meantime, another Facebook user said they wanted to see a similar feature in other vehicles. Fortunately, multiple manufacturers have stepped up with their own versions of Dog Mode, giving many consumers yet another reason to make their next car an EV.\n\n\"Every car should have this option. So cool!\" the user exclaimed.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk wants to bring more joy to the world.\n\nWriting on X on Christmas Eve, Musk said he was switching up Tesla's \"mission wording\" from \"Sustainable Abundance\" to \"Amazing Abundance.\"\n\n\"The latter is more joyful,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk appeared to be referring to Tesla's latest \"master plan,\" its long-term strategy document. The fourth edition, released this September, contains several mentions of \"sustainable abundance\" — an idea that Tesla's products and services will \"accelerate global prosperity\" and create \"a safer, cleaner, and more enjoyable world.\"\n\nAccording to Tesla's website, the EV company's actual mission statement is \"to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\"\n\nWhen Tesla's Master Plan Part IV was published earlier this year, the document was criticized for being lofty and vague. Musk appeared to concede the point, replying \"Fair enough. Will add specifics\" to a post on X from investing YouTuber Dave Lee in September.\n\nIt's unclear whether the \"amazing\" edit Musk teased will satisfy the critics, but the edit aligns with Tesla and Musk's future plans.\n\nMusk recently scored an amazing and abundant compensation package from Tesla worth up to $1 trillion if he can help the company deliver millions of cars, robots, and robotaxis, and increase the company's market value to $8.5 trillion over the next decade.\n\nMusk is known for playfully posting on X about his companies. The \"mission wording\" change is unlikely to signify a radical shift in direction for Tesla, though it could hint that the billionaire wants the brand's tone to be a little lighter.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment made outside normal business hours.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla and cofounded OpenAI. He wrote that vibe coding has produced a new type of code that is \"free\" and \"discardable.\"",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding\" earlier this year. Now, he has something to say about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla for five years, steering the company's Autopilot effort and briefly working on its humanoid robot Optimus. He sandwiched his Tesla job with two stints at OpenAI, making Karpathy a cofounder of the AI pioneer.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Karpathy published his year-in-review for large language models on X. He reflected on the famous term he originated in February, a term that has since shaken up the software engineering industry.\n\n\"With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals,\" Karpathy wrote. He called it an example of how \"regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments.\"\n\nVibe coding has likely benefited businesses, too. Tech companies have equipped their engineers with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex, aiming for productivity gains.\n\nKarpathy wrote that vibe coding \"empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written.\"\n\nIt may also change the makeup — or the use case — of the code itself. Karpathy threw out a slew of adjectives to describe this new body of code: It is \"free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use.\"\n\n\"Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions,\" he wrote.\n\nHow does Karpathy feel about being the term's origin?\n\n\"Amusingly, I coined the term \"vibe coding\" in this shower of thoughts tweet totally oblivious to how far it would go,\" he wrote.\n\nThere's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper…\n\nIt's not yet clear how efficient vibe coding is making engineers. In a METR study published in July, AI coding assistants were found to decrease the productivity of participating experienced software developers by 19%. The developers in that study were also overconfident in the tools, its authors said, expecting a 20% productivity boost even after using them.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the practice is unlocking a whole new form of tech products. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey vibe-coded a new messaging app this year. Non-technical workers are easily building, shipping, and, in some cases, even selling apps they build in hours, if not minutes.\n\nKarpathy gave some other reflections. He praised Google Gemini's Nano Banana image model, and wrote that Claude Code was the \"first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like.\"\n\nOverall, Karpathy wrote that 2025 was an \"exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs.\"",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

    "description": "Mercedes-Benz's electric CLA is priced $5,000 above the premium trim of the Tesla Model 3 — for an entirely different driving experience, BI found.",
    "fullText": "Calling a car, especially an EV, \"software-defined,\" when it's not a Tesla or Rivian can feel like a trap; it exposes a carmaker to some misleading or unhelpful comparisons.\n\nAt a media event with Mercedes-Benz earlier this month, I heard company representatives use the same phrase — \"software-defined vehicle\" or SDV — to describe the new CLA, Mercedes' entry-level EV, which starts at $47,250.\n\nThe CLA will be the launch platform for Mercedes' new MB.OS operating system, which will include an AI voice-assistant powered by both ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Drivers will interact with the new software interface through a screen that stretches across the entire dashboard. There are nearly 40 inches of display, including the driver's seat. It's a lot of screen.\n\nThere's also an advanced driver assistance system, which has become standard in modern vehicles. Mercedes plans to launch MB.DRIVE Assist PRO next year, which is supposed to share some of the ADAS functionalities as Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised.\n\nAs I heard Mercedes employees talk about the new CLA, I couldn't help think: Here's another legacy automaker now trying to play catch-up with major EV players.\n\nThat was before I got behind the wheel.\n\nI had the chance to drive the new CLA for about two hours around San Francisco. A week later, I demoed Tesla's premium trim of the Model 3, which is about $5,000 less than the entry-level CLA option.\n\nMercedes' new EV is no Tesla. Far from it. But, after my drive, I'd say it doesn't have to be.\n\nMy demo CLA didn't come equipped with Mercedes' MB.Drive Assist Pro, which is designed to be a Tesla FSD-level ADAS — essentially, supervised self-driving from the parking lot to the destination.\n\nStill, I was curious to try the Level 2 ADAS that came equipped in the car. A Mercedes spokesperson told me the latest update should provide a \"smoother overall driving experience with traffic light recognition and stopping.\"\n\nThe feature can be more comparable to Tesla's Autopilot, which provides steering assist, lane change assist, and recognizes traffic lights.\n\nIn a city like San Francisco, where there can be a lot of turning and stopping, relying on the ADAS felt a little tedious. I had to take over the wheel or press the brakes quite a bit to make a turn or wait for a pedestrian to cross.\n\nHowever, there was a crystal-clear moment in my drive when I realized my desire for an ADAS, which essentially drives for me, is secondary.\n\nPart of my test drive included traveling up O'Shaughnessy Boulevard, a long, winding road in San Francisco that leads to the Twin Peaks area.\n\nThe road in front of me was clear. I wasn't sure what was going on with the ADAS, whether it was on or \"suspended.\" So at one point, I disengaged the driver assist and pressed the pedal to see how it handled the curvy roads.\n\nReader — the CLA is a lot of fun to drive. Even in the busier city streets, the CLA's compact profile and torque from its electric powertrain made weaving past slower cars enjoyable — something an ADAS can't do, at least not yet.\n\nAnd that's a huge point that helped me overcome this mental reflex to compare the CLA to the Model 3.\n\nIn a Tesla, the driving experience can feel secondary to the technology.\n\nOutside the steering wheel, there's little else getting in between the driver and the large touchscreen, which is Tesla's goal.\n\nThe EV maker aims for most interaction between the car and the driver to occur through the screen. After all, Tesla's ultimate technological endgame is full autonomy. The bug or user error is the act of driving itself.\n\nWith the CLA, I felt Mercedes made a car that you'd prefer to drive — and everything from the premium-level interior to the AI voice assistant only helps you focus on that act.\n\nPart of the feeling is buoyed by the brand itself: There's something wholly uncool about spending 50 grand or more on a sporty Mercedes-Benz only to say that you don't really drive the thing.\n\nThat's not the most rational defense for buying a car. However, Mercedes itself almost advertises the CLA as an emotional experience rather than a rational purchase.\n\nSee how the German automaker talked about the CLA in some of its early press material: \"The most emotional vehicle in its class,\" \"sensual purity,\" and the \"style rebel\" that \"underscores the sporty side of the Mercedes-Benz brand.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called his cars a \"very sophisticated computer on wheels.\"\n\nWe're talking about very different audiences here.\n\nThe CLA does throw up some numbers that are competitive with the leading EV players: an EPA-estimated range of 374 miles, 268 horsepower, and a 10% to 80% charging time of 22 minutes for the CLA 250+ model.\n\nThe premium rear-wheel drive Model 3 I drove has an EPA-estimated range of 363 miles. Tesla doesn't break down horsepower or charging time the same way Mercedes does, but, according to Kelley Blue Book, most Tesla models can charge to 80% around 15 minutes.\n\nMercedes also plans to introduce a hybrid variant of the CLA, utilizing the automaker's new \"modular architecture.\" This is essentially the skateboard platform that EV companies use, allowing them to build other models efficiently on the same foundation.\n\nMercedes is just one of many legacy automakers that are now hedging their bets on EV-only segments and expanding hybrid options.\n\nIf the vast majority of consumers continue to remain uncertain about electric cars, Tesla is unfortunately boxed out of that game.",

Tesla is offering production associates and material handlers extra hours and pay to take on the role of AI operator, according to posters that appeared at its California factories earlier this month.\n\nThe AI operators sit in the driver's seat, actively monitoring the vehicle while Tesla's Full Self-Driving software is engaged, and taking over when needed. Tesla plans to eventually release the software as a fully autonomous service.\n\nThe extra sets of hands will help the company expand ride-hailing availability in the Bay Area, the posters said.\n\nThe posters, which also appeared in several engineering facilities, noted that staffers could earn $500 if they refer a friend for the AI operator role.\n\nSome sales staffers in Nevada and Arizona moved over to similar operator roles in Las Vegas and Phoenix last month, according to a review of LinkedIn profiles.\n\nAdding more operators could help Tesla speed up service. After Tesla rolled out its Robotaxi app to the public in September, wait times spiked, with some passengers reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes and a lack of available vehicles.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said he's recently seen wait times around 10 minutes in the Bay Area, and during peak commuting times, the app at times says it cannot provide a ride due to \"high service demand.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTesla completed the self-certification process for service in Nevada and Arizona last month. It has yet to apply for a license with the Nevada Transportation Authority to launch a commercial service, but it has a permit from the Arizona Department of Transportation that allows it to operate commercially in the state, spokespeople from the agencies told Business Insider.\n\nThe company has yet to begin offering paid rides in either state.\n\nMeanwhile, the company launched its Bay Area ride-hailing service in August. It's not registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California; it operates its service with a driver because the state has stricter regulations around autonomous vehicles than most other states, many of which operate around an honor system where the company self-certifies its vehicles.\n\nTesla has a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public as a regular car service with a driver. The agency has said Tesla is not authorized to transport members of the public in an autonomous vehicle.\n\nTesla currently has 1,655 vehicles and 798 drivers registered for its ride-hailing service in California, according to a spokesperson for the CPUC. Tesla is required to update the agency incrementally as it adds new vehicles to the fleet, but not drivers, the spokesperson said. (The registration number reflects vehicles approved for use; it doesn't necessarily indicate how many are operating at any given time.)\n\nLast December, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles for a permit with the California Department of Motor Vehicles that would allow it to test its autonomous software with a test driver.\n\nA spokesperson for the DMV said Tesla has yet to apply for a driverless testing permit, which would be required before the company can offer AV rides to the public.\n\nThe company also operates a ride-hailing service in Austin, where it launched with a safety operator in the passenger seat.\n\nMusk said during an xAI event earlier this month that Tesla's Austin service will be driverless by the end of the year.\n\n\"I think it's pretty much a solved problem, we're going through validation right now,\" he said, according to a recording posted on social media.\n\nA spokesperson for the Austin Transportation Department told Business Insider that the company has yet to inform the city of the date it plans to roll out the driverless feature to its commercial service. Tesla is not legally required to inform the city, but it has typically alerted it to changes to its service, the spokesperson said.\n\nTesla is hiring for AI operators across the US, including in Illinois, Massachusetts, Colorado, and Texas, according to its website. The role has around-the-clock shifts and requires workers to sit behind the wheel while FSD is engaged, interact with passengers, and collect detailed reports on vehicle performance. It can also involve testing in various cities across the country. The salary ranges from around $25 to $30 per hour.\n\nThe recruiting process involved an FSD test drive, a valid driver's license, and passing a drug test and background check, according to people who interviewed for the role.\n\nMusk said in October that the company plans to expand its service to eight to 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year. The company is testing its service in several cities across the country.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at gkay@businessinsider.com or Signal at 248-894-6012.

    "fullText": "Tesla has scaled its California \"Robotaxi\" program at a lightning-fast pace.\n\nTo date, the automaker has registered 1,655 vehicles for its ride-hailing service in the state, a spokesperson from the California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider. The company has registered 798 drivers, the spokesperson said.\n\nThat's up from 28 cars and 128 drivers in August, when the service launched, according to the CPUC.\n\nThe vehicle number reflects car that have been approved for use, not the actual operational fleet number. The spokesperson also said the carmaker isn't required to update the state as it adds new drivers, which means the current number could be higher.\n\nThe Alphabet-backed autonomous vehicle company began offering driverless rides for select members of the public in 2023.\n\nThe agency said Zoox has 229 registered vehicles. Zoox, which launched in San Francisco in November, told Business Insider that it has 50 vehicles active in its fleet between San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox and Waymo run fully autonomously.\n\nA spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Tesla registered more than 220 test drivers and 100 vehicles with the California Department of Motor Vehicles for a permit to test its self-driving software with a test driver.\n\nTesla's \"Robotaxi\" isn't registered as an autonomous vehicle service in California, which maintains some of the strictest AV regulations in the country. The company has not applied for a driverless testing permit, a DMV representative told Business Insider.\n\nThe company's permit from the CPUC allows it to provide transportation services to employees and some members of the public. A separate permit is required to transport passengers using an autonomous vehicle.\n\nSome users have complained on social media of long wait times since the company launched the Robotaxi app to the public in September. Tesla initially started operating the service with a small group of early access users; as access expanded, wait times have increased, with some users reporting on social media wait times as long as 40 minutes.\n\nBusiness Insider's Alistair Barr said that at times recently he's been unable to secure a ride due to a lack of inventory during peak commuting hours. On off hours, he's seen wait times around ten minutes, he said.\n\nTesla is ramping up driver staffing. The company has circulated flyers in its California factories offering hourly employees extra pay to help operate its network.\n\nIn Austin, where Elon Musk has said Tesla recently began testing its vehicles without drivers or safety operators, it's unclear how many cars the company has running in the service. Tesla is not required to submit these numbers to Austin, a spokesperson for the transportation department said.\n\nMusk said during an appearance in the \"All In\" podcast in October that Tesla planned to have around 500 vehicles running in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "description": "CEO Elon Musk claimed more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle following its botched reveal in 2019.",
    "fullText": "During the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, the company’s chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, threw steel balls at the truck to demonstrate its sturdiness, but instead shattered two windows. In an interview, von Holzhausen said the mishap became a “great marketing moment.” Tesla began selling T-shirts alluding to the accident, and CEO Elon Musk claimed the company saw 200,000 orders for Cybertrucks in the days following its launch.\n\nSome may call Franz von Holzhausen’s accidental destruction of a Tesla Cybertruck window a blunder; von Holzhausen would prefer to call it a “great meme” instead.\n\nDuring the 2019 reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck, von Holzhausen, the company’s chief designer, threw steel balls at the vehicle, intending to demonstrate the windows CEO Elon Musk that said were made of “armor glass” were indeed extra tough. The windows, however, unexpectedly shattered, leaving Musk to deliver the rest of his presentation of the new truck while standing in front of the damaged car. Tesla’s stock fell more than 5% the next day.\n\nWhile the incident seemed like an omen, indicative of the Cybertruck being poised to fail, the botched demonstration actually opened up an opportunity to give the new model a spotlight, von Holzhausen said in an interview with Tesla Club Austria published earlier this year.\n\n“It was just one of those Murphy’s Law kind of things where something bad happens, but it turned out to be a great meme,” von Holzhausen said, referring to the phenomenon of when something can go wrong, it usually will. “And I think in an odd sort of way—we don’t do marketing—but it turned into a great marketing moment.”\n\nHe added, “It was not an expected moment, but in that moment, you have to roll with it.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of the vehicle, Musk posted a video on X of von Holzhausen throwing a steel ball at the model Cybertruck before its launch, with its windows withstanding the force of the throw with no visible damage. The video was viewed more than 6 million times within three days of its posting.\n\n“Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha,” Musk wrote.\n\nDays later, Musk touted the success of the Cybertruck launch, saying Tesla had received more than 200,000 orders for the vehicle. While Tesla does not break out Cybertruck numbers when it reports earnings, instead grouping them with the Model S and X, the company recalled nearly all of the Cybertrucks it had on the road earlier this year due to an issue in which an exterior panel could become detached, and that only tallied around 46,000 vehicles.",

    "description": "Spencer Penn worked at Tesla and Waymo before he founded LightSource, an AI-powered sourcing and procurement startup.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Spencer Penn, the 33-year-old founder of LightSource, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI moved to California 10 years ago, back when Tesla was a boutique car business. We were making 1,000 vehicles a week.\n\nMy friends and family were telling me it was a big career mistake to work at Tesla. They said it would never be someone's main car, that it's a tech toy, that it's an iPad with wheels on it. But I was just excited to see what this Elon guy was up to.\n\nMy interactions with Elon were always very positive, but I'm not a fanboy. There were some things that were very notable about his leadership style.\n\nTesla is a very flat organization. When I was there, even relatively young and out of college, it was two levels between Elon and me. That's very unusual to have such close proximity so early in your career.\n\nJust because it's a flat org structure, doesn't mean it's a horizontal power dynamic. Elon is the king. What he says goes. If you wanted to get something done, you really did have to go through Elon.\n\nThe drawbacks were that the guy didn't have that much time. In 2017, he was running three different companies: Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink. He was just getting started with OpenAI. He had two and a half days a week to really focus on Tesla exclusively. You'd have to get things approved in that period of time.\n\nBut he was also very focused on the product. He would get involved in the way that things felt. If you wanted to change a texture on a paint, you'd want to get his buy-in.\n\nMany CEOs go the opposite direction. They let themselves get so far removed from the product. Elon always felt the product was the thing, and the innovation would be what drives the company forward.\n\nI like to embody that here at our company. I still do demos. If you take your hands off the wheel, things might veer in a direction you don't like.\n\nElon has a knack for setting overly ambitious goals. There are benefits and drawbacks. Sometimes, you lose credibility. Certain products like the new Roadster were unveiled back when I was an employee, and they've yet to be delivered.\n\nBut there are certain things where you shoot for the moon and you do hit the stars. Nobody thought Starlink would be as successful as quickly as it has been.\n\nIf you apply the right amount of pressure, you can see where the leaks are. That kind of ambition is everything.\n\nThat's the final thing Elon does: he's really a risk taker. He's bet the company multiple times; he always keeps putting the chips back on red. I think about that a lot. Sometimes it can be hard for professional management to take the risks they need to. Sometimes you can sleepwalk into a long-term, uncompetitive position.\n\nThere was some internal signaling. People knew that Elon was in the factory. They knew that he was going to stay there until the issues were fixed. Elon works about as hard as any human on earth possibly can.\n\nThere's a hotel right across the street from the Fremont factory. Part of me always felt like, instead of setting up pillows in a conference room, I would like our CEO to be well-rested and go to the hotel five minutes away. But the signaling was very potent.\n\nI try to embody that to some degree here, too. I like to come into the office five days a week. I want people to know that I'm coming in early and I'm staying late. I unload the dishwasher in the office. I'm assembling IKEA furniture.\n\nWaymo was a very different organization. It's a very vertical org structure. Google is a large organization with lots of levels, and that translated directly to Waymo, which is a much smaller business.\n\nEven though it's a very vertical org structure, it's a horizontal power structure. It's like it's rotated 90 degrees from Tesla.\n\nSome people compared the org to slime mold. It starts to spread and find all the crevices on its own. Individual contributors could construct their own ideas.\n\nThere are benefits and drawbacks. There is the possibility that there are duplicative teams doing the same things in different ways. But it also leads to a lot of creativity.\n\nAt Tesla, it was very clear that Elon and his lieutenants were driving a lot of the decisions. The decisions that the more junior people made would be incremental. At Google, I found that a lot of the best ideas come from the individual folks in the business, because they're given the freedom to roam.\n\nIn a startup, you have limited resources. You have to be focused, but a lot of the best ideas come from experimentation.\n\nWe had an engineer who asked if he could move his start date by a month. He was like, \"I want to spend a month before I get into work catching up on everything that's happening in AI.\" He came to the table, and he had so deeply immersed himself that he had a lot of new and fresh ideas. Many of those ideas have become product features.\n\nI have to delegate innovation to folks on the team to find those opportunities. That's something I learned from Google.",

    "fullText": "Decision from state supreme court on deal once worth $56bn and now worth some $139bn overturns ruling that prompted angry Musk backlash\n\nElon Musk’s controversial $56bn pay package from Tesla was reinstated by the Delaware supreme court on Friday, two years after a lower court struck down the vast compensation deal as “unfathomable”.\n\nThe reinstated pay package could be worth as much as $139bn today, according to the New York Times. The decision comes less than two months after Tesla shareholders approved a new plan that could be worth $1tn to Musk, already the world’s richest person, in a decade’s time. Musk’s fortune currently stands at an estimated $600bn.\n\nRescinding the pay deal would be “inequitable”, and would leave Musk “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years”, the Delaware supreme court justices wrote, echoing arguments from Tesla board members earlier this year.\n\nAt the company’s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, this November, shareholders had approved a stopgap measure for Musk, ensuring – regardless of how the Delaware supreme court ruled on this appeal – that he would get the $56bn his supporters say he is owed.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment or \n\nBoth of the compensation packages, as well as other pay plans approved by Tesla shareholders, require Musk to meet a number of lofty goals related to product development and increasing the company’s value to $8.5tn in order to cash out on those awards.\n\nThe case that first invalidated the original pay package was launched seven years ago when a Tesla stockholder, who held just nine shares at the time, filed a suit arguing that the plan was set up to overpay the world’s richest person. That first ruling voided the billions Musk was to receive, which left the Tesla co-founder less than pleased.\n\nNot only did Musk relocate Tesla to Texas from Delaware, where it was incorporated at the time the suit began, he also publicly lashed out against the state and specifically its court of chancery and chief judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick.\n\n“She has done more to damage Delaware than any judge in modern history,” he wrote on X, his social media platform, in February 2024.\n\nTesla stockholders in 2024 were again asked to vote on the 2018 pay package. They approved it, and once again, McCormick struck it down, ruling that the “Superstar CEO”, as she called him, had undue influence in developing his own pay package and that stockholders weren’t fully informed ahead of the vote.\n\nMusk has voiced his displeasure ever since.\n\n“Any lawyer still recommending incorporation in Delaware at this point should be sued for malpractice,” he posted online earlier this year.\n\nIn Friday’s opinion, the justices agreed with McCormick’s earlier findings that there was a breach of fiduciary duty in developing the original package and presenting it to shareholders. They ordered $1 be paid to the plaintiff in nominal damages.\n\nHowever, the five judges agreed that rescinding Musk’s full pay package wasn’t appropriate.\n\nWhile Musk has publicly called for other companies to follow his lead and leave Delaware – which has historically been home to more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies – experts have tracked only a few dozen companies that have actually done so. That includes big companies including Dropbox and Coinbase, while other tech companies like Meta have only threatened to leave.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is entitled to his $55.8 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, Delaware's Supreme Court ruled.\n\nA Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down the compensation package last year after a Tesla shareholder sued over the massive payday, which was tied to a series of growth goalposts for the EV company.\n\nThe Delaware Supreme Court's ruling overturns that decision, saying it was too extreme a remedy.\n\nTesla shareholders recently approved an even bigger pay package of up to $1 trillion for Musk if Tesla achieves further sales and growth goals.\n\nThe decision to withhold his 2018 pay package prompted Musk to criticize Delaware on several occasions. Delaware's long-standing reputation for being business-friendly is rooted in the Delaware General Corporation Law, which serves as the foundation of its corporate law.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Musk wrote on X in August 2024.\n\nAt the time, two of Musk's companies — Tesla and SpaceX — were incorporated in Delaware. He moved those companies to Texas in 2024.\n\nDespite Delaware's position as a central incorporation hub, a series of court rulings left some prominent companies wondering if they could find stronger legal protections somewhere else, including VC firm Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe firm announced in July that its primary business, AH Capital Management, would no longer be incorporated in Delaware because \"legal uncertainty\" had worried investors and entrepreneurs on its board.\n\n\"As a result, many of the companies we fund and the entrepreneurs that we talk to are taking a second look at whether they should incorporate in other jurisdictions, prompted by the departure from Delaware of significant technology companies like Dropbox, Tripadvisor, and Tesla,\" the firm said in a blog post.\n\nThe firm said it's reincorporating in Nevada, an increasingly popular alternative.\n\nBusinesses incorporated in Delaware account for a large chunk of the state's revenue. As of 2024, more than 2.1 million businesses were incorporated in Delaware, meaning a widespread exodus could do serious damage to its economy.\n\nEven so, Delaware Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez told Business Insider that officials aren't spooked by the \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"What our data is showing is that Delaware is still the preeminent place to incorporate your business,\" she said.\n\nPatibanda-Sanchez added: \"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way. We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "description": "Tesla was struggling hard as recently as March. But its stock has soared as the company's fortunes have turned around.",
    "fullText": "2025 has been a good year for comebacks.\n\nWe got the first \"Final Destination\" movie in 14 years. Future NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Philip Rivers unretired last week after nearly five years away. And of course you have Michael Burry ferociously blogging up a storm after an extended public absence.\n\nThe stock market has also seen its share of reclamation stories, with none more high-profile than Tesla, the eternal lightning rod.\n\nAfter a post-election Trump bump in late 2024, the company endured a difficult first quarter. Shares were nearly cut in half as CEO Elon Musk pivoted to government work by spearheading DOGE, and as sales fell globally. It was a grim time for shareholders.\n\nBut the company was able to turn things around, and currently sits just below record highs. The chart below, and the accompanying sections, trace the timeline of Tesla's stock resurgence.\n\nApril: Musk steps back from DOGE\n\nInvestors were getting restless that Musk was too focused on Washington, and not focused enough on making EVs. Then, when he said he'd step away from DOGE, they breathed a collective sigh of relief, helping along a 25% rally over just four days.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to lower their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days. The stock ended up rising 17% that week. There would be further agreements with China, but this initial one marked the biggest inflection point.\n\nEarly September: Tesla introduces possible $1 trillion pay package for Musk\n\nThe argument in favor of such a lucrative package was that the continued presence of Musk as CEO makes up a large chunk of the company's value.\n\nIts introduction showed Tesla's board was serious about keeping him around, which pleased investors. Shares rallied 17% over the following week. The package was ultimately approved in November, which also pushed the stock higher.\n\nMid September: Musk buys back a bunch of shares\n\nTalk about throwing fuel on the fire. Musk's decision to buy back $1 billion worth of Tesla stock ignited another leg higher, pushing shares 7% higher in a single session. They then climbed an additional 8% the following week.\n\nMusk being willing to spend his own money on Tesla stock signaled confidence in the business, and comfort with valuation levels.\n\nNovember: Fed comments clinch a December rate cut\n\nThe December rate cut may have come and gone as a relative formality, which makes it easy to forget that it was still in jeopardy as recently as mid-November. Then, New York Fed President John Williams sealed the deal with some commentary on Nov. 21. Tesla rallied sharply alongside the broader market, soaring 10% over the next week.\n\nIt's been mostly a straight shot higher to records since then.",

    "fullText": "Many electric vehicle drivers have experienced disturbing incidents at charging stations when others maliciously unplug the cables or even cut the cords. Surveillance footage and personal confrontations often reveal that vandals disrupt EV charging out of spite or hatred towards people who own and drive clean-energy vehicles.\n\nHowever, even business owners and store managers sometimes unplug EVs on their property, much to the dismay of drivers who rely on public charging stations.\n\nIn a Reddit post to r/TeslaModelY, one driver shared details about a frustrating encounter while charging at a local grocery store.\n\nThe OP explained they began charging their EV at a grocery store and went into the store's Starbucks to work while it was charging. The store manager told the OP that he unplugged the car because those stations are only for customers.\n\nHowever, the OP was actually a customer who bought a drink and was working inside the store's coffee shop. The encounter made the OP feel \"extremely uncomfortable,\" so they packed up their belongings and left.\n\n\"I'm bummed as this used to be the grocery store I would get my groceries at, and it was always nice to be able to charge my car while shopping, but I don't want to ever go back there knowing that the store manager is a creep who follows customers on their cameras and will, without hesitation, unplug their cars while charging,\" the OP shared.\n\nThis situation is unfortunate because it prevented an EV driver from charging their EV. It also created anxiety for the OP by eliminating a reliable charging source while out running errands.\n\nUnfortunately, EV driver harassment is a widespread problem worldwide. Not only do unplugging vehicles and other threatening behaviors create unnecessary tension between EV and non-EV owners, but they also slow the broader adoption of clean-energy driving.\n\nThose who have yet to learn about the impressive technological advancements and benefits of EVs may rely on outdated information or anti-EV propaganda to justify their actions.\n\nIt's true that EV production does use some natural resources and generates some pollution. However, EVs are still far cleaner and more sustainable than gas-powered vehicles, which release tailpipe fumes wherever they go.\n\nHow long would you be willing to wait for an EV to charge?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhen you embrace highly efficient electric vehicle driving, you help sustain breathable air and contribute less to overheating the planet. You can also save significantly on vehicle ownership costs by avoiding the need to buy gas and the routine maintenance costs of traditional cars.\n\nIn response to the OP's post, Reddit users offered their advice about how to handle the situation.\n\n\"You should definitely use one of those charging locks next time you go,\" one Redditor recommended.\n\n\"I would complain to corporate or his boss,\" someone else suggested.\n\n\"Report them for tampering with a customer's car,\" another Redditor wrote.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk's net worth has surged to a record $648 billion — and his wealth gain this year exceeds LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's entire $205 billion fortune, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has jumped by $178 billion in just two days, boosting his year-to-date gain to an unmatched $216 billion.\n\nIf that figure were his entire fortune, he would rank sixth on the rich list — ahead of not just Arnault but also former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk's record wealth partly reflects Tesla stock closing at an all-time high of $490 on Tuesday, as investors cheered news that the EV maker is testing driverless robotoxis on Austin, Texas streets. Musk holds a roughly 12% stake in Tesla, valued at around $200 billion.\n\nBut the bigger driver of his wealth surge this week has been SpaceX's valuation reportedly doubling since the summer to $800 billion, based on a secondary share sale by the aerospace company ahead of a potential IPO next year.\n\nMusk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is now more than twice as wealthy as number two on the rich list, Alphabet cofounder Larry Page, who's worth $264 billion after a year-to-date wealth gain of $96 billion — second only to Musk.\n\nHe's also more than four times as rich as Warren Buffett, the outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who's worth $150 billion after giving more than half of his fortune to good causes.\n\nMusk's personal fortune exceeds the market values of Oracle, Mastercard, and Johnson & Johnson — three of the 20 most valuable US public companies with market capitalizations exceeding $500 billion. His recent gains have narrowed the gap with Visa, which has a market value of $660 billion.\n\nThe serial entrepreneur has had a striking wealth recovery in recent months. Tesla stock roughly halved between mid-January and mid-March as his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked public backlash and worried shareholders that he was getting distracted.\n\nMusk even briefly lost his top spot on the rich list to Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison in September, before Tesla shares rallied to fresh highs.\n\nTesla and other huge US tech companies have seen their stock prices soar this year, fueled by immense buzz around AI. In Musk's case, he's excited investors by spending big on AI to develop Tesla's autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.\n\nThe AI boom has translated into huge wealth gains for key shareholders such as Musk, Page and his cofounder Sergey Brin, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Ellison, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.\n\nMusk could become the world's first trillionaire after Tesla shareholders approved his pay package in November, which promises to roughly double his stake in Tesla over the next decade if he hits milestones such as selling 1 million Optimus robots and raising adjusted profits from around $17 billion last year to $400 billion.",

    "description": "Tesla stock staged a massive rebound, with shares climbing 120% from their low in April on a handful of positive catalysts.",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock has mounted a stunning comeback in the latter half of this year.\n\nShares of Elon Musk's carmaker have erased their losses after plummeting earlier in 2025, and, as of this week, have clawed their way back to all-time highs.\n\nTesla closed at a record $489.88 a share on Tuesday. The stock is up 121% from its low in early April. Shares are up 26% for the year as of Wednesday morning, putting the company in the upper echelon of Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThe rally in recent months marks a remarkable turnaround for the stock, which has been battered in volatile trading and mired in a bear market for much of the first half of the year. Shares of the EV company had plunged more than 50% from their peak in December 2024 to their trough in April, driven largely by declining Tesla sales, concerns about tariffs, and CEO Elon Musk's presence on Capitol Hill.\n\nIt's rally this week to all-time highs came as Musk gave a bullish update on Tesla's robotaxi rollout in Austin. Investors have pinned a lot of hopes on self-driving tech amid this year's dip in car sales. Along with its robotics initiatives, markets see Tesla's non-auto business as the primary bullish catalyst heading into 2026.\n\nA general risk on mood amid rate cuts and more optimistic forecasts for stocks next year has also helped spur the latest leg of Tesla's comeback.\n\nHere's what has driven the stock's blistering rally in the last several months.\n\nMusk said he would step back from the Department of Government Efficiency on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call. The news sparked relief among investors, who have long complained that the CEO may be too distracted by his sprawling empire of companies and his political ambitions to focus on Tesla.\n\nShares rose nearly 20% after Musk made the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nThe US struck its first trade truce with China in May, with both sides agreeing to slash their respective tariff rates for a period of 90 days.\n\nThe agreement temporarily removed a key headwind for Tesla, which sources its supplies heavily from China. The nation also makes up a key market for Tesla's vehicles.\n\nTesla shares rose alongside the broader market, climbing nearly 9% after the announcement through the end of the week.\n\nSince then, other positive developments between the US and China have also helped give Tesla a boost:\n\nElon Musk appeared to mend his relationship with President Donald Trump after the two billionaires publicly feuded over Musk's opposition to the Republicans' tax and spending bill.\n\nIn the heat of their argument, the White House said Trump was considering selling or giving away the Tesla he purchased earlier in the year. The president also threatened to yank contracts the government struck with Elon Musk's companies.\n\n\"I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,\" Musk wrote in a post on X on June 11.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post in an interview the same day, Trump said he thought the gesture from Musk was \"very nice.\"\n\nTesla shares rose 6% through the end of the week.\n\nTesla rolled out a new pay package for Musk after a Delaware Court struck down a previous $56 billion package.\n\nShares rose 12% in the week following the announcement on September 5.\n\nThe new package, from which Musk can earn up to $1 trillion, was approved by shareholders in November and comes attached with aggressive targets. For Musk to earn his massive payout, he must boost the company's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million cars a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots.\n\nOn September 12, Musk purchased $1 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a securities filing released the following Monday. The purchase boosted Musk's ownership of the company from around 13% to 15%.\n\nInvestors are looking at the purchase as a sign of commitment from Musk, who has been accused of neglecting his duties at Tesla since he first sought to acquire Twitter in 2022.\n\nTesla shares rose another 3% through the end of the week.",

    "title": "CA judge rules Tesla lied about FSD, must fix marketing within 60 days",
    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "An X user recorded a Tesla Model Y driving through Austin's streets on Sunday that appears to show no one, not even a safety monitor, inside.\n\nSince Tesla launched its robotaxi in Austin in June, the driverless cars have always included a human in the passenger seat.\n\nThe video generated a fair amount of excitement online from Tesla watchers, some of whom immediately went to their app to order a robotaxi to see whether it would include a safety monitor (they did).\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk later said on Sunday that the company is now testing driverless taxis without human safety operators, though it appears not yet on actual paying customers.\n\n\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" Musk wrote in response to the X user who posted the original video.\n\nTesla itself responded to the video with \"Just saying.\"\n\nTesla's AI chief, Ashok Elluswamy, also responded. \"And so it begins!\" he wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nA driverless Tesla Robotaxi was spotted on the roads of Austin, Texas today.No one in the car.

Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Tesla-investor-turned-bear Ross Gerber says that Elon Musk needs to show results on the company's biggest initiatives in 2026 or face investor backlash.",
    "fullText": "Ross Gerber, an early backer of Tesla, is worried about the future of Elon Musk's car company.\n\nGerber doesn't hold back about what he thinks is the EV maker's biggest issue: its autonomous driving technology. Failure to live up to expectations would be a blow to investors' bull thesis for Tesla, which is pegged in large part to the success of its self-driving cars.\n\nGerber, the founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, has been a vocal Tesla bear all year. His perspective hasn't changed as Musk's company has rolled out driverless cars in cities across the US, and what he's seen has actually made him more concerned.\n\nGerber told Business Insider why he thinks 2026 will be a pivotal year for the EV maker, in which Musk will be forced to show real progress on the lofty goals he's set for Tesla.\n\nAnyone who follows Gerber knows that he has gone from a Musk supporter to an outspoken Tesla bear in recent years. He's publicly called for Musk to resign and criticized his focus on other ventures, such as his time leading the Department of Government Efficiency and his efforts to buy X before that.\n\nMusk stepped away from government months ago, but Gerber maintains that the time he spent away from his companies is still hurting Tesla stock, particularly as the it dukes it out with competitors in the self-driving car market.\n\n\"The year that Elon took off from Tesla really cost Tesla a year,\" Gerber told Business Insider.\n\nIn that time, Tesla's chief competitor, Waymo, has continued to dominate the self-driving car market. Gerber attributes this to Musk's refusal to use LidAR technology in Tesla's vehicles, a remote sensing method that has helped Waymo increase the safety of its cars on the road.\n\n\"Waymo has expanded rapidly in our area,\" he said. \"So Tesla has to accept, if they just throw a couple sensors on and improve their hardware system, they can solve full self-driving next month.\"\n\nHowever, Gerber thinks that Musk will continue to favor the use of AI and cameras. And since Musk has staked much of Tesla's future on its self-driving car technology, he thinks this approach is about to start costing the company.\n\nOverall, Gerber thinks that 2026 will be the year Musk needs to show investors results of Tesla's many initiatives or face backlash from the market.\n\n\"I've been saying this for some time, next year is kind of like the come-to-Jesus year for Tesla,\" he said.\n\nMusk has said that self-driving technology is Tesla's future, but so far, the company has struggled to get drivers to actually pay for it.\n\nGerber added that he sees Google and Waymo's parent company, Alphabet, as the best stock to buy for gaining exposure to the self-driving car market, due to Waymo's edge over Tesla and Alphabet's resources.\n\nHis bullish thesis on Waymo centers on the company's strong presence in major US cities, which is expanding while Tesla has only just begun its rollout this year.\n\n\"Google has the money and they're not going to wait,\" Gerber said. \"They know they can scale, so for Tesla to catch them, they would need this to work right away, basically, and then they need to start building infrastructure.\"\n\nAnother problem Gerber sees is one he's brought up before, which is Musk's public perception. That might be a problem even if Tesla catches up to competitors in key areas like autonomous driving. Gerber thinks the image of Musk has yet to recover since his foray into politics sparked divisive views among consumers earlier this year.\n\n\"The image of the company is so negative in people's minds that even if they had cabs everywhere, people would just choose another cab company, because there's plenty to choose,\" he speculated.\n\nGerber noted that he also has strong doubts about the demand for the humanoid robots that Tesla is building, despite Musk's claims that they'll eliminate poverty and be able to perform surgery.\n\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",

    "title": "Tesla's latest launch isn't a car — it's a $350 pickleball paddle — and it's not even electric",
    "description": "Tesla has partnered with Selkirk to launch a $350 pickleball paddle \"optimized for high performance play.\"",
    "fullText": "From Elon Musk — the guy who brought the world a branded flamethrower — it somehow tracks that Tesla is now making pickleball paddles.\n\nThe EV company launched its latest lifestyle product on Friday: a $350 pickleball paddle created in partnership with Selkirk, a sports equipment company.\n\nThe paddle, made of carbon fiber with a foam core, was \"optimized for high-performance play,\" according to the product page.\n\n\"This wasn't simply a branding exercise. It was a true engineering collaboration,\" Selkirk's co-owner and director of research and development, Tom Barnes, said in a statement about the release. \"Tesla's design group and our R&D team spent more than a year trading data, refining geometry, and stress-testing prototypes.\"\n\nA Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider that the paddle's creation was first conceptualized after a conversation at the 2023 USA Pickleball National Championships between Barnes and members of Tesla's engineering team.\n\nAfter Barnes delivered a custom batch of Tesla-themed paddles to the EV-maker's staff, Selkirk leaders visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California. While there, they connected with Javier Verdura, Tesla's global director of product design, who is an avid pickleball player, and began the design process.\n\nPrototypes were sent to Tesla for aerodynamics testing before the design was finalized.\n\nThe limited-run batch of the paddle sold out on Tesla's website in under three hours after its launch, a Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider. Plans for a restock remain unclear.\n\nWhile the pickleball paddle is Tesla's first foray into traditional, non-electrified sports equipment, the automaker does offer a line of apparel and home products, like drinkware ($30+), backpacks ($185+), and salt and pepper shakers ($65).\n\nMusk's other business ventures have also leaned into collectible merchandise, such as the Boring Company's flamethrower, which went viral in 2018.\n\nTesla's lifestyle products are not listed as a separate line item in their financial reports, and there is no publicly available evidence to suggest that they have a significant impact on the company's finances. Tesla stock closed up more than 2% on Friday, but sank slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nPickleball, which combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, has experienced explosive growth in popularity in recent years. The 2024 Pickleball Single Sport Report, released by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, found that participation has increased by 45.8% since 2023 — representing 311% growth over the past three years.\n\nIn that time, pickleball has transformed from a suburban hobby for the 55+ crowd into a popular activity and networking opportunity among Silicon Valley professionals.\n\nEntry-level equipment for the sport doesn't require a significant investment, with a basic paddle and ball running less than $50. However, since pickleball has gained traction among tech personalities like Bill Gates and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, higher-end products have crept into the market.\n\nSome Selkirk models run upward of $150, while others, like the Aero Blade 1.19, cost $299 and up. The Aero Blade features a carbon fiber frame with a foam core, similar to that of the Tesla version.\n\nThe debut of the Tesla pickleball paddle elicited split reactions on social media, with some fans of the brand celebrating its release as a clever gift opportunity ahead of the holiday season. Others were quick to criticize the price point and Selkirk's strategy to partner with Tesla, rather than a well-known pickleball player or influencer.\n\n\"Selkirks out here like 'We are going to let every signed pro walk, and then collab with the worlds biggest brands that have nothing to do with pickleball,'\" Jimmy Miller, a pickleball player and host of the '\"King of the Court\" podcast, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"Bold strategy. Curious if it pays off,\" he added. \"Tesla fans will probably sell that paddle out. Who is next? Apple? Maybe they can do a Nvidia collab that comes with shares!\"",

    "title": "Newly surfaced video of Tesla Optimus robot raises eyebrows following suspicious movement: 'Seems to be a … disaster'",
    "description": "\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant.\"",
    "fullText": "A six-second clip of a Tesla Optimus robot's \"suspicious tumble\" emerged on Reddit, Electrek reported, reviving skepticism about the electric vehicle manufacturer's autonomous technology.\n\nIn recent months, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been laser-focused on the company's artificial intelligence and robotics endeavors. Musk has asserted that \"AI and robotics\" were the only things that can save the United States from financial doom, and that those technologies would make money obsolete.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, Tesla hosted an \"Autonomy Visualized\" event at a dealership in Miami, and a user on Reddit's r/TeslaMotors shared a brief clip of Optimus' reverse face-plant.\n\nTesla Optimus\n byu/Decent_Cheesecake643 inteslamotors\n\nIn the six-second video, Optimus was seen knocking over a few plastic water bottles before toppling over backward. However, the robot's unmistakably human gesture served as a \"Wizard-of-Oz\"-like reveal of the man behind the curtain. (Click here if the embedded video does not appear.)\n\n\"Looks like the operator took off their VR headset,\" a user observed, which was the general consensus on a different Reddit thread shared two days later.\n\n\"That's exactly what happened,\" another user replied, with another possibility that a teleoperator simply noticed they had knocked over some bottles and threw up their arms in dismay, unintentionally causing the robot to lose its balance.\n\nOne Reddit comment depicting a GIF of a \"Robocop 2\" scene in which a malfunctioning Robocop prototype makes a similar gesture to lift off its helmet racked up over 17,000 likes. Electrek commenters were equally unimpressed.\n\n\"Tesla couldn't even get their robot to serve popcorn at their new restaurant,\" one wrote. \"Everything Tesla does with robots seems to be a disappointing disaster.\"\n\nAnyone who follows Tesla developments is deeply familiar with Musk's tendency to wildly underestimate timelines.\n\nIn 2019, he famously predicted that 1 million driverless Tesla Robotaxis would be criss-crossing American roads in 2020.\n\nWhen they finally debuted on a small scale in June, it was obvious to riders that human operators were involved — yet Robotaxi crashes also occurred at a surprising rate.\n\nDo you worry about robots taking away our jobs?\n\nYes — but it will create new ones too\n\nPossibly — but not significantly\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nTesla's Optimus was first unveiled in 2022, but coverage of its purported capabilities often focused on the obvious human intervention. If Optimus were Tesla's sole focus, its level of autonomy would be less of a concern.\n\nHowever, Musk has long prioritized autonomous EVs over other advancements. He recently promised that Tesla drivers could soon \"text and drive\" safely, forcing law enforcement agencies to reiterate that the activity remains illegal.\n\nAmid plans to release an autonomous model called the Cybercab without seeking the necessary regulatory approvals, Tesla's struggles to make autonomous driving a reality can undermine consumer trust and discourage drivers from making their next car an EV.\n\nFor better or worse, Tesla remains the most prominent EV manufacturer; if a perception that the brand is unsafe persists, fewer EVs on the road and more tailpipe pollution could result.\n\nAfter a challenging 2025 and Tesla's Optimus-related missteps, the brand is leaning heavily on the Cybercab's debut to turn things around.\n\nThis month, Musk said Tesla's Robotaxi fleet would double in size before the year was out, but questions about its level of autonomy lingered.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "Here are 4 ways Rivian just stepped deeper into Tesla's turf",
    "description": "Rivian revealed ambitious plans for fully autonomous driving, featuring an in-house chip, an in-car AI assistant, and a Tesla-like subscription model.",
    "fullText": "Rivian is all-in on autonomous driving, stepping deeper into a territory Tesla has long positioned itself to dominate.\n\nOn Thursday, at Rivian's R&D office in Palo Alto, the EV maker unveiled a road map to develop autonomous-driving capabilities for its future lineup of vehicles, including new hardware for the highly anticipated R2 — Rivian's cheapest car to date.\n\nThat road map includes a new silicon chip, designed in-house, that will power Rivian's next-generation hardware and support self-driving functions. The new hardware is expected to ship with R2 by the end of 2026, Rivian said.\n\nRivian CEO RJ Scaringe has been hinting at autonomous ambitions in recent years. However, since the company's first shipment of vehicles in 2021, Rivian's advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) software — Driver+ and the Rivian Autonomy Platform — has been more akin to Tesla Autopilot than Full Self-Driving Supervised. Tesla's Autopilot provides lane-centering and adaptive cruise control, while FSD can recognize traffic lights, conduct turns, and drive to a destination under constant driver supervision.\n\nThursday's announcement deepens Rivian's rivalry with Tesla as both companies have expressed goals of fully autonomous driving and licensing their software platforms to other automakers.\n\nRivian's partnership with Volkswagen, announced last year, was a clear first shot at those licensing ambitions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently balked on X that no automaker wanted to license FSD.\n\nHere are four ways Rivian is taking a page out of Tesla's playbook.\n\nRivian has been using a combination of Nvidia and Qualcomm Snapdragon chips to power various vehicle functions, including driver-assistance and infotainment systems.\n\nNow, the company is turning to in-house silicon to power its next-generation autonomous driving hardware.\n\n\"At the core of Rivian's technology roadmap is the transition to in-house silicon, designed specifically for the vision-centric physical AI,\" the company said.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the chips will be manufactured by TSMC.\n\nTesla began a production shift toward in-house chips in 2019 and has since released two iterations, AI3 and AI4. Musk has said that Tesla's next-generation chip, AI5, will be 40 times better than its predecessor.\n\nRivian's \"Gen 3 Autonomy\" hardware is under validation and is expected to be shipped with R2 by the end of 2026, the company said.\n\nWith the new chips, Rivian's explicit goal is to achieve full autonomy — that's Level 4, or the kind of self-driving technology seen in Alphabet's Waymo, in which driver supervision is not required.\n\nMusk has already made full autonomy Tesla's north star, pledging to turn every personally-owned Tesla into a robotaxi that can generate revenue.\n\nThe Tesla CEO's goals have been met with considerable skepticism, particularly due to the company's decision to abandon lidar, a sensor that many industry leaders consider essential for safety and redundancy in self-driving cars.\n\nRivian, for its part, plans to incorporate lidar into the R2 vehicle. The sensor appears to be installed within the car, just above the middle of the windshield.\n\nA Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that the company collaborated with a third party on the \"exterior design\" of Rivian's \"lidar implementation.\"\n\nThe company did not share a timeline for launching fully autonomous driving.\n\nIn the near term, Rivian will update its ADAS with hands-free assisted driving capability. The feature won't be functional on every road, according to a press release.\n\nRivian said it will be available on \"over 3.5 million miles of roads across the USA and Canada\" and can operate \"off-highway on roads with clearly painted lines.\"\n\nAt Thursday's event, Scaringe also suggested potential robotaxi ambitions.\n\n\"This also enables us to pursue opportunities in the rideshare space,\" the CEO said.\n\nRivian is following Tesla's FSD subscription model for what it's calling \"Autonomy+.\"\n\nThe software will launch \"early 2026\" and be priced at $49.99 a month or $2,500 for a one-time purchase.\n\nTesla's FSD is $99 a month or $8,000 up front.\n\nRivian said the software will be continuously updated. The \"trajectory\" for the feature will be \"point-to-point\" navigation — where users type in a destination, and the car drives itself just like FSD — as well as eyes-off driving capabilities and \"personal L4\" capabilities, according to the automaker.\n\nThe Rivian spokesperson told Business Insider that \"hundreds of millions of miles contribute to the development of Autonomy+.\"\n\n\"This data is comprised of samples from around the US and Canada year-round, capturing diversity in both geography and seasonality,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMusk announced in July an integration of xAI's Grok in Tesla vehicles, providing a chatbot that drivers can talk to and, more recently, ask for directions.\n\nRivian will be following a similar playbook with \"Rivian Assistant,\" an AI voice interface that will be \"model-agnostic,\" according to the automaker.\n\n\"Our framework allows us to orchestrate different models and choose the best one for the task,\" a Rivian spokesperson said.\n\nThe company said in a press release that the AI assistant can connect to third-party apps and will start with the integration of Google Calendar.\n\nThe AI assistant can also assist with vehicle diagnostics and control certain vehicle functions, such as activating the car's seat heaters.\n\nThe feature will be shipped early 2026 on Gen 1 and Gen 2 R1 vehicles.",

    "description": "Elon Musk has amassed a $491 billion fortune through his work at Tesla, SpaceX, and more. Here's the tech CEO's daily routine.",
    "fullText": "He's the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, the social media platform, X — and he's also a father of at least 14 children.\n\nAccording to Forbes, he's amassed a fortune worth $491 billion, making him the world's richest person. Musk has said he didn't get there by working a typical 40-hour week, and is instead known to have a strenuous schedule that he said has demanded 120-hour workweeks in the past.\n\nStill, the South African mogul shares similarities with the average person in his typical daily routine. Like many of us, Musk enjoys a sweet treat in the morning and spends time scrolling social media.\n\nHere's how his days usually go, according to interviews and posts by Musk himself over the years.\n\nMusk told The Wall Street Journal in 2023 that he usually goes to bed around 3 a.m. and sleeps for six hours. So, he's typically waking up around 9 a.m. each day.\n\nHe might've been trolling when he wrote a response to a doctor that same year on X saying he eats \"a donut every morning,\" but a quick search of Musk's posts reveals he's quite a fan of the pastry.\n\nSpeaking on \"The Katie Miller Podcast\" in December 2025, he gave an updated glimpse into his morning routine, saying his typical breakfast is \"steak and eggs and coffee.\"\n\nMusk said in 2022 that he was trying to break the cycle of checking his phone as soon as he woke up. While on the Full Send Podcast, Musk described it as \"a terrible habit\" he hoped to escape.\n\nBut, as of 2023, he still wakes up and immediately looks at his phone for emergencies, the Journal reported.\n\nIf his posts on X are any indication, the habit persists. He has been active on the platform since before he acquired it in a $44 billion deal in 2022, often posting at odd hours and in the middle of the night.\n\nIt's unclear if Musk slots in time to post and respond to others each day, but it certainly looks like he rarely takes a day off from the app.\n\n\"Some days I wake up and look at Twitter to see if it's still working,\" Musk told Walter Isaacson in the \"Elon Musk\" biography.\n\nMusk previously credited showering with having the biggest positive effect on his daily life.\n\nDuring an AMA session on Reddit in 2015, a user asked which of his daily habits impacted his life the most.\n\nAs the CEO of one of the leading EV makers in the US, it's no surprise that Musk has more than one option for his daily commute.\n\nWhen an X user posted a meme about deciding between driving a Cybertruck without autopilot or a Tesla Model S with self-driving technology, Musk responded that it's a choice he faces \"every day.\"\n\nThe Cybertruck has been in the backdrop of many celebrity paparazzi shots and Instagram posts since its official launch in November.\n\nLike many, Musk appears to have had ups and downs in his relationship with physical exercise over the years. In 2021, he told Joe Rogan that he'd avoid it altogether if he could.\n\n\"I almost never work out, except for picking up my kids & throwing them in the air,\" he said on X in June 2023.\n\nBut less than two months later, he said he was \"lifting hard almost every day.\" Around the same time, talk of Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg going head-to-head in a fight swirled online.\n\nMusk told Miller during his December 2025 podcast appearance that he often skips lunch or eats something \"small\" for his midday meal.\n\nDinner, though, can be \"anywhere,\" he told the podcast host, who is married to White House advisor Stephen Miller.\n\n\"I like the wide range of cuisine,\" Musk said, with \"American\" food like cheeseburgers and pizza being his favorites.\n\nHe added, \"If I had to say, like, there's only one thing you can ever have for the rest of time, which admittedly would be a bit monotonous, but it would probably be a cheeseburger, because cheeseburgers are amazing. It's a genius invention.\"\n\nNo wonder his Tesla Diner in Hollywood features burgers prominently on the menu.\n\nMusk has admitted on several occasions that running more than one company isn't easy. He splits time between his companies depending on the \"crisis of the moment,\" the 54-year-old said in 2021.\n\nOne X user pointed out in January 2023 that Musk had testified in a lawsuit in the morning, attended an event at a Nevada Tesla factory in the evening, and worked with Tesla on AI at night — all in one day.\n\nMusk responded that he'd also spent time at \"Twitter HQ past midnight.\"\n\nAnd then was at Twitter HQ past midnight. Very long day.\n\n\"I go to sleep, I wake up, I work, go to sleep, wake up, work—do that seven days a week,\" Musk told the Journal in 2023. \"I'll have to do that for a while — no choice — but I think once Twitter is set on the right path, I think it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.\"\n\nOn the Tesla earnings call in April 2024, Musk said: \"Tesla constitutes the majority of my work time, and I work pretty much every day of the week. It's rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon off.\"\n\nAlthough he's not getting eight hours a night, Musk has upped his sleeping schedule from being nearly nonexistent in the past.\n\nIn May 2023, Musk told CNBC that he's no longer pulling all-nighters. Instead, he said he tries to get at least six hours of sleep.\n\nAccording to Isaacson's biography of Musk, the billionaire has spent many nights awake and pondering the issues his companies face. His former partner Claire Boucher — known by her stage name Grimes — also told Isaacson that Musk once stayed up all night playing the \"Elden Ring\" video game when it first came out.\n\nHe has a history of sleeping on the floors of his offices and the Tesla factory.\n\nAfter purchasing Twitter in 2022, Musk all but moved into its San Francisco headquarters. He said there's a couch in the library that he would crash on from time to time.",

    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.\n\nThe analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business.\n\n\"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"\n\nIt's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nPercoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months.\n\n\"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.\n\nPercoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.\n\nIt cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots.\n\nOne risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern.\n\n\"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"\n\nAnd while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.\n\nPercoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",
