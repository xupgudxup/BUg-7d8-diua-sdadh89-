While most of Apple's services, like the App Store, Find My, and iMessage, are all \"Available,\" four of these services are experiencing an outage: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple TV Channels, and Game Center.\n\nIf you click on each, you can see the service's full status report:\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nUsers may be experiencing intermittent issues with this service.\n\nGame Center - 1 Outage, 1 Resolved Issue\n\nOutage: Today, 2:53 PM - ongoing\n\nUsers may be experiencing a problem with this service.\n\nResolved Issue: Today, 8:43 AM - 9:14 AM\n\nUsers may have experienced a problem with this service.\n\nIt's not clear what is causing the outages, though they all went down at 2:53 p.m.. (Apple doesn't specify, but I imagine that's ET.) This isn't the first time this has happened, of course. In fact, Apple Music was down earlier this year, though it was actually still working for me when Apple said the outage was active.\n\nThat appears to be the situation today, as well. Each report says \"some users are affected,\" not all. As it happens, Apple Music is working on my Mac, and I'm able to stream the free pilot episode of Pluribus without issue.\n\nApple will likely get these services back up and running for affected users. In the meantime, if your Apple Music or Apple TV won't cooperate, this is likely the cause.",

    "fullText": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the reason Russia has just banned FaceTime, but it was surprising iMessage had escaped a ban.\n\nA potential reason for this has now been discovered: Apple may have accidentally made it almost impossible for a government to ban its end-to-end encrypted text messaging app …\n\nRussia last week blocked the use of FaceTime within the country, naturally using terrorism as the excuse.\n\nJustifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: “According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.” The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations.\n\nFaceTime uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), so audio and video calls cannot be intercepted by the state. However, some were curious why Russia hadn’t done the same with iMessage, which is similarly protected by E2EE.\n\nOne potential explanation offered is that iMessage usage within the country is extremely low, with most people preferring other messaging apps. Now, however, another possible explanation has surfaced.\n\nWhen Apple commenter John Gruber wondered aloud about this, Mastodon user Magebarf had an idea.\n\nIsn’t it still that the iMessage traffic is merged on the same endpoint as the push notifications? So, if taking out iMessage all remote push notifications to iPhone would immediately cease to work.\n\nThey suggested this was a deliberate decision by Apple, but the aim was to ensure carriers, rather than repressive governments, couldn’t block iMessage. Carriers might otherwise have been tempted to do so as the service reduced demand for SMS, which attracted per-message charges at the time.\n\nThis is how they shoehorned in iMessage under the nose of all phone operators, who already had been using the push notifications as one of the the major reasons for their customers to get a iPhone, and now they couldn’t block the iMessage traffic.\n\nAs evidence for this, they noted that choosing the messaging-only tier on in-flight Wi-Fi services means you continue to get push notifications for other apps you can’t actually access.\n\nSince FaceTime also relies on the Apple Push Notification service (APNs), it’s not 100% clear whether this is indeed the explanation. There are also other methods a government could use to block iMessage, such as blocking access to Identity Services, though this may be tougher to implement across an entire country.\n\nHowever, it does seem to be at least plausible and if accurate would explain an otherwise surprising decision.\n\nOf course, assuming it was an accidental side benefit of a policy targeting carriers is also speculation. It may well be that Apple had in mind also protecting against repressive governments, although in that case you might have expected it to similarly protect FaceTime.\n\nBenjamin Mayo contributed to this report\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
