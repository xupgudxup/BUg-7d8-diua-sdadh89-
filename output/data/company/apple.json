    "fullText": "HarmonyOS, Huawei Technologies' self-developed operating system, has crossed the threshold of 27 million users, a sign that the company's efforts to take on Apple's iOS and Google's Android are paying off.\n\nIn announcing the user numbers for its latest iterations - HarmonyOS 5 and HarmonyOS 6 - the Shenzhen-based tech giant referred to the milestone as a \"survival line\" for the company.\n\nThe platform also boasted an ecosystem of over 10 million developers. User engagement crossed milestones, too, with more than 100,000 new devices activated on a daily basis, as well as over 88 million daily downloads and updates recorded for applications, according to the company.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe latest figures, which come six years after the company first launched the operating system to counter Washington's sanctions on its access to Android, reflected how Huawei's efforts to develop an alternative for the world's largest smartphone manufacturers were paying off.\n\nHuawei has been transitioning its own devices to the operating system since 2021, ramping up efforts after the US placed the company on its Entity List in 2019 over national security concerns. The privately held firm has since expanded HarmonyOS beyond smartphones and tablets.\n\nHuawei Pura 80 smartphones are displayed at the company's flagship store in Beijing, June 11, 2025.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nHarmonyOS 6, the latest iteration, was initially made available to developers in June and released to Chinese consumers in October. That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple Watch User Should Know",
    "description": "The Apple Watch isn't just about notifications and workouts.",
    "fullText": "The Apple Watch is both a companion to the iPhone, as well as a very capable device in its own right. Out of the box, it offers notification mirroring, so you feel every alert on your iPhone on your wrist, as well as workout tracking, so you can keep up with your fitness goals. But this wearable can be so much more than that. In fact, it doesn't take much to make your Apple Watch more personal and efficient. If you own one, here are ten hacks you need to know about:\n\nGet your notifications under control. By default, Apple likes to forward every single alert from iPhone to your watch. That’s just a recipe for distraction. You should turn off most of these alerts, and only keep the most important notifications. An important message from Slack or a text from a close friend is worth the distraction; a promotion from Uber is not. Open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to Notifications, scroll down and disable most of the apps that mirror alerts from the iPhone.\n\nWhile you’re at it, it might help to keep your Watch in Silent mode at all times. Open the Control Center by pressing the Side button and tap the Bell icon to quiet your watch for good.\n\nThe Apple Watch's recent wrist gestures have turned out to be a sleeper hit for me. What I thought would be a gimmick is something I use multiple times a day now. If you have an Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2, SE 3, or higher, you get access to two gestures: Double Tap and Wrist Flick. First, if you tap your index finger and your thumb twice in the air, you’ll perform the major action current on-screen. This could include answering a call, stopping a timer, or stopping a workout. I use this all the time now, even when I don’t have my hands full. Second, you can flick your wrist up to go back a screen on your watch. This is a simple way to get back from menus, or to go back to the watch face, without actually tapping the screen.\n\nThis is a feature I've been using for years, but since it's buried quite deep in settings, many users don't know about it. Once set up, you can unlock your Mac automatically as long as you’re wearing your Apple Watch. It doesn’t even have to be on the same wifi network, so this works when you’re out and about.\n\nTo set this up, go to System Settings on your Mac, then choose Touch ID & Password. In the Apple Watch section, simply turn on the sync feature for your Apple Watch. Once you authenticate with your Mac password, you’ll be good to go. The next time you lift the lid on your Mac, macOS will automatically sign you in.\n\nI used to love customizing my watch face with all the various complications for timers, shortcuts, and, weather, just to name a few. But I was never really satisfied with how cluttered things looked when it was all set up. That changed once I embraced the Photos watch face, and moved all the contextual information and shortcuts to widgets. Keeping all those functions and data points in a collapsable stack of widgets, rather than all on screen at once, looks so much better.\n\nTo try this out for yourself, scroll using the Crown or swipe up on the watch face to access your widgets. Go to the bottom and tap the Edit button to start customizing your widget stack. You can add three app shortcuts to the top widget. I usually save this for workouts, battery, and the quick timer. Then, I have dedicated widgets for my Activity Rings, Weather, Shortcuts, Sleep, and more. You can pin widgets in the order that you want, and watchOS will also automatically suggest relevant widgets depending on your usage. Dive in deeper with our detailed guide on customizing widgets.\n\nOnce you move your app interactions to widgets, your watch faces suddenly open up. Take some time to create and customize two to three watch faces that you can switch between as you wish. It's easy to do at any time: just swipe in from the left or the right edge to change the watch face.\n\nCreating and customizing watch faces is actually easier on the Watch app on the iPhone. In fact, it’s the only place where you can set up my favorite watch face: the Photos watch face. This watch face cycles between the photos of my wife, nature, and urban landscapes, showing me a fresh selection each day. I love this watch face quite a lot. You can also create a watch face for fitness tracking and fitness modes, and a simple watch face for regular use. (My favorites here are Typograph and Meridian watch faces.)\n\nFor almost a decade, you couldn’t edit your Activity Rings. If you got sick, or just wanted to take an easy day, you’d lose your fitness streak. This, of course, isn’t the healthiest approach to fitness—for that, you should check out the Gentler Streak app. However, since last year's watchOS 11, you’ve had the option to pause or change your Activity Rings. You can do this from the Fitness app on iPhone, which is slightly easier than using the Apple Watch itself. From the Fitness app, tap Activity Rings, then scroll down, where you'll see Change Goals and Pause Rings. Choose the relevant option to get started. I have detailed instructions in my guide as well.\n\nIf you use an Apple TV, you know how easy it is to lose the remote. You might be familiar with the Apple TV’s remote control feature on the iPhone, but that same feature exists on the Apple Watch as well. You’ll have to find the Remote app from the app list, then choose your Apple TV. It should appear as long as it's on the same network as your watch, and nearby. From here, you can use swipe gestures and buttons to control playback on your TV.\n\nOn the Apple Watch, silent mode and alarm sound levels are married to each other, unlike on the iPhone. But recently, Apple added a feature where you can break-through silent mode for a particular alarm—it's just not enabled by default for all alarms. To set it up, open an alarm from the Alarms app, go to the Edit Alarm menu, scroll down, and enable Break Through Silent Mode.\n\nFocuses on the iPhone are supremely powerful, and underrated. And things get a lot more interesting when you add Apple Watch to the mix. Each Focus can have its own watch face associated with it, so you can have a different watch face for your work Focus, another one for your personal Focus, and a fitness watch face for your workout Focus. Go to Settings > Focus to customize or create any Focus.\n\nYour Apple Watch comes with a built-in sleep tracker. To use it, you can either go to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, and create a sleep schedule, or simply switch to the Sleep Focus. When you’re in sleep mode, your watch automatically goes dark and silent, so you won't be bothered by any notifications.\n\nWith watchOS 26, your Apple Watch now also gives you a sleep score, which offers more insights into your sleeping habits. I’ve been using the Sleep mode this past year with my Apple Watch Series 10, and I’ve gotten a lot out of the sleep tracking feature already.",

    "fullText": "I wrote earlier this week about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the security fixes are two zero-day bugs affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”\n\nPretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a major Messages privacy leak. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.\n\nApple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released iOS 18.7.3 to address the same issues.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is capable of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)\n\nThis isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.\n\nSeveral users have reported to me that a workaround is to 7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.\n\nIn general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "fullText": "NGL, an anonymous messaging app that soared to the top of the Apple app charts in 2022 before reaching a settlement with federal regulators for targeting minors, has been acquired by Mode Mobile, a smartphone company that allows users to earn rewards.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStarted in a WeWork, NGL never raised outside funding and stayed lean with only five employees. Named after an acronym for \"Not Gonna Lie,\" the app debuted in November 2021 and briefly shot to the No. 1 overall spot on Apple's US App Store in 2022.\n\n\"Anonymous apps have long held a certain kind of allure for young people,\" Business Insider wrote at the time in 2022. \"They offer a sense of anticipation, a dopamine hit if the anonymous comments or questions are favorable. Will someone confess their feelings for you? Shower you with compliments? One can only hope.\"\n\nNGL surged in popularity, but much of that growth came from illegally targeting minors, according to a 2024 complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission and Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.\n\n\"NGL marketed its app to kids and teens despite knowing that it was exposing them to cyberbullying and harassment,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement.\n\nNGL and its founders paid a $5 million fine to settle and agreed to no longer market to minors.\n\nSince then, cofounders Raj Vir and João Figueiredo have refocused the app on adults and strengthened safety measures.\n\n\"There was a short-term effect from restricting under-18 usage, followed by renewed momentum after refocusing on an 18+ audience,\" said Figueiredo, who says the app now has reached the point where he believes it would be best to sell.\n\n\"NGL stands out as one of the most culturally relevant Gen-Z platforms operating at true global scale, with more than 125 million monthly active users and one of the strongest viral loops we've seen replicate across countries and cultures,\" Dan Novaes, CEO and Co-founder of Mode Mobile, wrote in an email.\n\nThe company's three employees will join Mode Mobile, while Vir and Figueiredo say they will move on to pursue other unspecified projects while also advising during the transition.\n\nOther anonymous messaging apps, such as Ask.fm, Yik Yak, Yolo, and LMK, have also been criticized for facilitating cyberbullying and harassment.

    "description": "AirDrop codes makes things a bit more secure and convenient.",
    "fullText": "AirDrop is one of Apple's best features. I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.\n\nIf AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good.\n\nThen, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes.\n\niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)\n\nHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file.\n\nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction.\n\nAs stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed.",

    "description": "If your display turns bright, you have a new notification.",
    "fullText": "There are fewer and fewer hardware differences between iPhones and Androids as the years go on, but back in the day, that was far from the case. At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device.\n\niPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification.\n\nFor the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another.\n\nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash.\n\nTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n\nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled.\n\nYou'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications.\n\nIt's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked.",

Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.\n\nThank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)\n\nAnd oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.\n\nSimogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s origin on their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.\n\nTimes have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "fullText": "watchOS 26 wasn't a huge update, but it did introduce some new features. You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:\n\nwatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.\n\nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you.\n\nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nYou'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n\nIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n\nFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice.\n\nApple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone.",

    "title": "All the New Features in iOS 26.2",
    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",

    "description": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the...",
    "fullText": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the reason Russia has just banned FaceTime, but it was surprising iMessage had escaped a ban.\n\nA potential reason for this has now been discovered: Apple may have accidentally made it almost impossible for a government to ban its end-to-end encrypted text messaging app …\n\nRussia last week blocked the use of FaceTime within the country, naturally using terrorism as the excuse.\n\nJustifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: “According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.” The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations.\n\nFaceTime uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), so audio and video calls cannot be intercepted by the state. However, some were curious why Russia hadn’t done the same with iMessage, which is similarly protected by E2EE.\n\nOne potential explanation offered is that iMessage usage within the country is extremely low, with most people preferring other messaging apps. Now, however, another possible explanation has surfaced.\n\nWhen Apple commenter John Gruber wondered aloud about this, Mastodon user Magebarf had an idea.\n\nIsn’t it still that the iMessage traffic is merged on the same endpoint as the push notifications? So, if taking out iMessage all remote push notifications to iPhone would immediately cease to work.\n\nThey suggested this was a deliberate decision by Apple, but the aim was to ensure carriers, rather than repressive governments, couldn’t block iMessage. Carriers might otherwise have been tempted to do so as the service reduced demand for SMS, which attracted per-message charges at the time.\n\nThis is how they shoehorned in iMessage under the nose of all phone operators, who already had been using the push notifications as one of the the major reasons for their customers to get a iPhone, and now they couldn’t block the iMessage traffic.\n\nAs evidence for this, they noted that choosing the messaging-only tier on in-flight Wi-Fi services means you continue to get push notifications for other apps you can’t actually access.\n\nSince FaceTime also relies on the Apple Push Notification service (APNs), it’s not 100% clear whether this is indeed the explanation. There are also other methods a government could use to block iMessage, such as blocking access to Identity Services, though this may be tougher to implement across an entire country.\n\nHowever, it does seem to be at least plausible and if accurate would explain an otherwise surprising decision.\n\nOf course, assuming it was an accidental side benefit of a policy targeting carriers is also speculation. It may well be that Apple had in mind also protecting against repressive governments, although in that case you might have expected it to similarly protect FaceTime.\n\nBenjamin Mayo contributed to this report\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

And despite the trillions of dollars invested, AI is yet to show a way it can sustainably turn over profits.\n\nSo what happens, asks Nosheen Iqbal, if one day the faith falters, the money stops coming in and the bottom falls out?",
