    "description": "Watch collector clubs inside Apple and Google have collaborated with watchmaker Tudor on limited-edition timepieces that are available for resale.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams.\n\nTwo custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market.\n\nSilicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The love of watches has bred collectors' groups within some of the biggest companies.\n\nA watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500.\n\nThe style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. Similar pre-owned models typically resell for around $3,000.\n\nThe limited Apple collectors group edition features a skull-and-crossbones pirate flag motif with deep ties to Apple's history.\n\nIt's a callback to the Steve Jobs era. The late CEO once said in a meeting, \"It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy,\" and the members of the Macintosh team often referred to themselves as pirates, as a former employee described in a blog post. In a nod to those roots, the company flew a pirate flag over Apple's headquarters for its 40th anniversary.\n\nAbout 82 of these \"pirate\" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing.\n\nA Tudor watch created in collaboration with Google's watch collector group, Watches@, is also for sale on the vintage watch marketplace Wind Vintage.\n\nIt's from Tudor's Pelagos collection and features a Google-centric twist that tech fans may recognize: the Google Chrome Dino at the 6 o'clock position on the dial. The design is inspired by the Chrome Dino that pops up when your computer isn't connected to the internet. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome.\n\nThe watch, created in 2024, is listed for $14,900. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451.\n\nOther Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces.\n\nApple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nLoupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving.\n\nThey tend to sell for more than base models because of their limited quantities, Ku said, and they attract \"real fans\" of the brands they represent.\n\n\"For tech nerds like myself, the pirate flag is a symbol that has a long tradition of being used by the Apple folks,\" Ku said. \"Also, the imagery of that pirate flag is quite charming.\"",

    "description": "Great: more stuff I'll lose.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of Meta's Display smart glasses might come with a smart watch. According to a report from The Information, Meta's watch, codenamed Malibu 2, could feature fitness tracking features and AI, but its real purpose is to replace the Display's neural band and act as controller for the smart glasses. If the reports are accurate, Meta Display smart glasses with a smart watch could be available in 2026.\n\nThere aren't any other details on the smart watch, so we don't know the price or what features it may have—but I'd be surprised if this rumor doesn't pan out eventually. Meta has discussed the idea of a smart watch before, and it makes sense: If you're going to have a wrist-controller for your glasses, why not give it smart watch features as well? Especially if a glasses-and-watch combo potentially gives users a reason to switch away from their Apple Watches.\n\nSpeaking of Apple, if the rumors about the company are true, Apple is pushing to release its own suite of AI-powered wearable devices. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple could roll out smart glasses in early 2027. The company is also reportedly developing an AI-powered pendant that can \"be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace,\" as well as AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. The AirPods and pendant will be equipped with cameras designed to \"help the AI work\" as opposed to taking photos. Apple's smart glasses will reportedly not feature a display, but will feature a higher end camera and superior build quality to Meta's smart glasses. All of Apple's devices are reportedly designed to work with iPhones.\n\nNone of this is confirmed, of course. The closest Apple has come to announcing these plans is CEO Tim Cook mentioning “categories of products” enabled by artificial intelligence at an all-hands meeting. However, everything points to Meta and Apple betting that consumers want a collection of connected AI-wearables. Each company is taking a different approach to hooking users into their ecosystem. Apple seems to be betting on devices integrated with iPhones and controlled with the kind of camera-based tech that powers the Apple Vision Pro headset. Meta seems to be aiming at replacing phones with an in-glasses display, and a biometric control scheme that works with muscle movements, like the existing neural band.\n\nBoth Meta and Apple seem to be competing to go beyond a screen or smart glasses to become the next interface for your life—but do people want that? Are consumers excited enough by the prospect of always-available AI and tied-together devices to buy them? That's the big question, and the answer is anything but certain. Both Apple and Meta have made big bets on virtual reality, and, despite both companies' VR devices being excellent, neither seems to have captured the market in way these firms would have liked. So, as they say, stay tuned.",

    "fullText": "Apple's small but mighty Mac Mini is flying off the shelves.\n\nThe sudden increase in demand is confusing some store workers, who are wondering why now?\n\nIn a TikTok video posted February 9, an employee can be heard telling a customer at Best Buy: \"I don't know what's with the Mac Mini, everyone keeps buying them a lot. Is this some AI thing?\"\n\nYes, it is an AI thing, and it's giving the Mac Mini a moment with tech enthusiasts.\n\n“is this some AI thing??” me trying to explain to Best Buy employees why everyone is coming in to buy the Mac mini #ai #openclaw #clawdbot\n\nOpenClaw is a rapidly evolving, open-source, autonomous AI agent previously known as Clawdbot or Moltbolt. Its creator, Peter Steinberger, recently joined OpenAI after being courted by AI CEOs, including Sam Altman and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg. OpenClaw can organize users' schedules, monitor vibe-coding sessions, and run other AI agents. It can also be locally run on your computer, which can eat up a lot of memory. That's driven a bit of a frenzy for devices with higher memory, like some Mac Minis.\n\nPeople are buying up the 5\"-by-5\" computer at a pace Apple can't seem to keep up with, as the tech giant shows weekslong wait times for the higher-memory Mac Minis. New York-based shoppers, for example, can get the 16-gigabyte Mac Mini by this weekend, while the 24-gigabyte and 32-gigabyte options have shipping and pick-up windows that extend until March 18, as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCustom and higher-memory configurations often take longer to ship, but the online buzz around the Mac Mini and OpenClaw is easy to link.\n\nResellers on eBay are also trying to cash in on the hype. There are dozens of new Mac Mini listings asking for the retail price or more for brand-new and pre-owned computers.\n\nBefore you snap up your M4 chip Mac Mini, you might consider waiting for a new wave of devices to drop. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, known for his inside information on Apple, reported that new Mac computers, including a new mini, are expected in 2026.",

    "title": "Apple Is Adding ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to CarPlay in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "You'll need to wait for a new update to try it.",
    "fullText": "When Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.4 this week, testers immediately got to work looking for each and every new feature and change. To their credit, there's more new here than in iOS 26.3, including an AI playlist generator for Apple Music and support for end-to-end encryption with RCS (finally). But one update slipped under the radar, since it's not actually available to test in this first beta: CarPlay support for AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nAs spotted by MacRumors, CarPlay's Developer Guide spills the beans on this upcoming integration. On page 13, the entitlement \"CarPlay voice-based conversational app\" is listed with a minimum iOS version of iOS 26.4. While it doesn't specifically mention integrations with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, the documentation does suggest that voice-based conversational apps are a supported app type in iOS 26.4. As such, MacRumors is reporting that companies that make chatbots (i.e. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google) will need to update their apps to work with CarPlay.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, drivers will be able to ask apps like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini questions while on the road, but they won't be able to control functions of the car or the driver's iPhone. You also won't be able to use a \"wake word\" to activate the assistant (e.g. \"Hey ChatGPT,\" or \"OK, Gemini\"), so you'll need to tap on the app itself to talk to the assistant.\n\nApple is issuing guidance to developers on how to implement these assistants in CarPlay starting with this latest update. On page seven, Apple notes that voice-based conversational apps must only work when voice features are actively being used, and avoid showing text or imagery when responding to queries. It's the first time Apple is allowing developers of \"voice-based conversational\" apps to develop for CarPlay. While the company has allowed other developers to make apps for its in-car experience, it has obviously put limitations on what types of apps can get through. It makes sense for Google to develop a Google Maps CarPlay app, but TikTok has no business offering drivers a CarPlay-version of its algorithm.\n\nThis addition is coming to iOS 26.4, but likely in a future beta. Don't install the beta at this time expecting to try this feature out—though, you should think twice before installing the beta at all. Betas like iOS 26.4 are temperamental, as Apple is currently testing the software for bugs and stability issues. By installing it early, you risk dealing with those issues, which could impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss.",

    "title": "OpenAI, Meta, and Apple's latest battle: Breaking your phone addiction",
    "description": "The tech companies that created our phone addiction are trying to cure us with AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "The average American picks up their phone more than 200 times a day. Teens are pinged with some 250 notifications a day — during school, after school, and overnight. The apps meant to prevent you from checking apps have done little to stop the problem. Now, some of the tech companies that helped create our screen dependence are trying to disrupt it.\n\nLater this year, OpenAI plans to debut a small, screenless device that Sam Altman describes as more \"peaceful\" than a smartphone. Apple, the Oz of screentime, is developing smart glasses, a pin, and AirPods with more AI built in, according to a Tuesday report from Bloomberg, with the rumored pendants featuring microphones and cameras to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the iPhone. Meta has teased its fully augmented reality Orion glasses since 2024. While that device doesn't have a release date, the company last year sold some 7 million pairs of its smart glasses, which is the start of the post-smartphone future Mark Zuckerberg has predicted. Eventual smart specs could be more screen all-the-time than screenless, but they also rely on AI to make the experience much more hands-free than swiping and scrolling on a phone.\n\nCould AI be what finally breaks our phone addiction?\n\nSince 2007, no device out of Silicon Valley has captured universal imagination the way Steve Jobs did when he put your iPod, your phone, and the internet together on a 3.5-inch screen. Competitors have tried for a decade-plus to get people to shift us from the iPhone to smart glasses, and largely failed. The awe around smartphones has turned to derision, as excessive screen time is linked to disrupted sleep, anxiety, and fractured attention. Now, developers are hoping the AI boom can give us the next big thing.\n\nBeating the smartphone would mean replacing a device that 91% of American adults now carry — a device for which millions of apps have been developed and people now depend on in lieu of wallets and cameras and health monitors. New AI devices can't just copy what smartphones do, says Ramon Llamas, a research director at a technology intelligence firm IDC: They have to show they have a solution to an everyday problem. If they don't, Llama says, \"these things are just gonna really end up as solutions looking for a problem to solve.\"\n\nCritiques of screen time can be as blunt and smoothbrained as what the critics say excessive screen time makes you. A seven-hour daily log may seem like a staggering amount of dependence, but what did the person spend those seven hours doing? Doomscrolling late into the night, or FaceTiming with a far-away friend? With AI wearables, there's the risk of becoming dependent on the device for different reasons.\n\n\"The screen may not be there, but what's getting filled in the back is already this problem of AI companionship,\" says Olivia Gambelin, an AI ethicist and author of the book \"Responsible AI.\" An AI device designed to do something very specific — like listen to a meeting and then send follow-up emails or messages related to action points discussed — could save people time and keep them from writing tedious emails and Slack messages from their desk. But that same device listening in to personal conversations with family and friends could compromise a relationship, and erode the positive effects that texting a friend to check-in can have on both people (already, my friends are tiring of AI summaries on the iPhone that summarize our group text and become an intermediary into our threads of gossip and jokes in the name of efficiency). Wearing microphones and cameras to social interactions and into businesses is likely to really weird out some of the people around you. More people are entering into romantic, dependent relationships with AI companions, and a swell of loud dissenters are criticizing the technology for taking jobs and attempting to replicate human relationships.\n\nBut OpenAI is betting that it can package its technology in a device in a way that calms the user. \"When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way,\" Altman said in November. OpenAI's device, he said, would be less Time Square, more \"sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm.\" That's because the AI device would learn \"contextual awareness of your whole life,\" and when best to send you alerts.\n\nOther AI wearables have failed by falling short of that goal. Humane AI sold a wearable pin, priced at $700 plus a monthly fee to connect it, but pulled it from the market a year ago. It failed perhaps because it tried too hard to replace our phones — it didn't interact with them, but provided a shoddy replacement. Novelty wasn't a factor that could outshine usability. The AI Friend pendant, which can't search the internet or help with tasks outside of sending reminders and acts instead as an eavesdropping sycophant around its user's neck, was mocked relentlessly and sold just a few thousand devices after it hit the market last year.\n\nCompanies trying to make AI hardware should focus on \"transformative features,\" Jason Low, research director at Omdia, tells me in an email. AI wearables must be more than \"marginally more convenient,\" should integrate with our existing products, and have a clear, stated value. For example, glasses that provide real-time language translation or devices for fitness and health tracking offer features our smartphones can't do as well. The Oura ring continues to grow in popularity, particularly among women after starting out as a niche tech bro buy, for the novel insights it can offer; the company announced last fall it has sold 5.5 million rings since 2015, with more than 2.5 million sold between June 2024 and September 2025. \"These devices often deliver a more polished user experience compared to general-purpose, do-it-all AI devices,\" Low says.\n\nLlamas tells me that the AI functions of a wearable have to be \"contextual, personalized, and actionable,\" like reminding the wearer to send birthday flowers or responding accurately to being asked to direct the user to the nearest Starbucks. A first attempt device shouldn't try to replace the smartphone, but to integrate with the Apple or Google ecosystems, he says. Apple and OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about their rumored products for this story.\n\nIf anything has hyped Silicon Valley like the iPhone, it's been AI. But three years after the mainstream adoption of ChatGPT, the value generative AI in the white collar workforce has yet to be fully realized. That could make a product for consumers a hard sell, too. \"Some of the overwhelm that's coming with AI that I see in general users is you can use it for everything, or it's promoted that way, which is actually quite stifling,\" Gambelin says.\n\nIn our quest to find a peaceful equilibrium with tech, the screen itself may not be the problem; it's what's summoning us to the screen. Its bright colors, games, and infinite scroll give quick dopamine hits that entice us to stay glued to it. But much of what pings my phone throughout the day are useless notifications trying to get me to reopen one of the dozens of apps — a markdown moment on a clothing thrifting app, a like on the Instagram story I've posted of my dog from my best friend, and ironically, a report of how much time I've already logged. There's a relentless business model at play to keep us on these apps. No screens would mean no infinite scroll through TikTok, no Candy Crush — but app developers and companies may need to find new ways to reach people if wearables caught on, and an always-there AI device and companion might not be as peaceful as Altman describes. Our collective screen time is a problem, but the AI wearable will have to surprise us all with something novel to be useful.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "Here Are the New Features Coming in iOS 26.4",
    "description": "Let AI create Apple Music playlists for you.",
    "fullText": "iOS 26.3 was a decidedly small update. It introduced a new tool to transfer data to Android, and gave some iPhones the ability to hide precise location data from cellular networks. But beyond some other small changes and security patches, that's all there was to write home about. iOS 26.4 is a different story. The update, which is currently in beta testing, adds a number of interesting new features to compatible iPhones, especially if you're an Apple Music user.\n\nAs with all beta software, iOS 26.4 is currently in testing, which means these features are subject to change at any time. It's possible some won't make it to the official release of iOS 26.4, while others could look different than they do now. While you can install the iOS 26.4 beta at any time by enrolling your device in the beta program, do so at your own discretion. I'd recommend using a secondary device to test this software if you can, but either way, make sure the device in question is fully backed up to a computer before installing the beta.\n\nThe latest trend in streaming services seems to be AI-generated playlists. YouTube Music recently rolled out the option, while Spotify offers a couple different takes on the feature. The idea is to tell the AI what type of music you want to listen to, whether that be a specific artist or genre, or just a concept or mood (e.g., \"Make me a playlist for drinking coffee on a lazy Sunday morning\").\n\nNow Apple Music is the latest service to introduce such a feature. The first iOS 26.4 beta comes with \"Playlist Playground,\" which works about how you'd expect. You tell Apple Music's AI what you want to hear, and it generates a playlist with 25 different songs. You can adjust the playlist if you don't like the result, as well as edit the title, cover image, and description.\n\nIn addition to Playlist Playground, Apple Music's UI is also changing in iOS 26.4. You'll see new full-page artwork when listening to music, as well as redesigned albums and playlists that adjust their colors based on the artwork. Plus, there's now a \"Concerts Near You\" feature that helps you find shows in your area, based on the music you like to listen to.\n\nRCS support is the best thing to happen to the iPhone in a long time. It makes texting Android users about the same as texting iPhone users, which has not been the case for most of iMessage's history. But while most of the standard perks rolled in with the update, including functioning group chats and high-quality image sharing, one key feature did not: end-to-end encryption (E2EE).\n\nWithout (E2EE), your messages can be intercepted and read by those with the skills to do so. With E2EE, they cannot. It's a major security feature that's key to both iMessage and RCS, and one of the reasons you shouldn't send messages over SMS, as it doesn't support E2EE. Not all Android setups support E2EE over RCS, but it's still a bummer that the iPhone's Messages app doesn't either.\n\nThat's now changing. With the first iOS 26.4 beta, Apple is now testing E2EE for RCS. You'll find the option in Settings, though Apple notes that not all devices or carriers support it. Someday soon, however, iPhone users texting Android users over RCS will be able to enjoy the added security benefits of E2EE.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple changed the Wallpapers settings menu. Before, you could select from pre-downloaded wallpaper packs on your iPhone; now, you can choose which packs you want to download instead. It's a small change, but an interesting one at that. It seems Apple doesn't want to assume you're interested in all of its wallpaper options anymore, and instead would rather pick and choose the ones you want to try. Apple also made similar changes to picking watch faces in the Apple Watch app.\n\nIf you ever label reminders as \"urgent\" on your iPhone, you'll find them in a new location. Now, when you open Reminders, you'l find an Urgent section, alongside other options like Today, All, and Scheduled.\n\nWhile this isn't an iOS feature, it is a key new change in the first macOS 26.4 beta. Apple is now testing a \"charge limit\" feature on Mac, similar to the charge limit feature that already exists on iOS; when your device is plugged in for a long period of time, it will limit how much the battery can charge to. You can set the cap as low as 80%, or as high as 100%. The idea is, by limiting the charge level, you reduce how often the battery completes a full charge cycle, which can prolong its lifespan and delay aging. The \"younger\" your battery is, the longer it'll last between charges, so enthusiasts like to use these features to maximize how much battery life they can get out of their devices.",

    "fullText": "Over the years, Apple Music has improved its algorithmic playlists. There's now an AI DJ, and you can use ChatGPT to generate playlists. With iOS 26.4, which is currently in beta, Apple wants you to make playlists with its own AI tech. The upcoming update includes a feature called \"Playlist Playground,\" which lets you generate AI playlists directly in the Apple Music app—as long as you're running iOS 26.4.\n\nI do not recommend installing and running beta versions of iOS on your primary iPhone. Beta software is unfinished, which means you could run into bugs and glitches that may impact how you use your iPhone, or even result in data loss. If you're itching to try out new features, it's best to ensure that you've taken a complete backup of your iPhone first. That way, you can always revert to an older installation in case something goes wrong. Even so, it's safer to run test software on a backup iPhone as opposed to your daily driver.\n\nWith that said, if you're sure you want to go ahead and install iOS 26.4 right now, you can go to Settings > General > Software Update on your iPhone. Select Beta Updates > iOS 26 Developer Beta. Now, go back to the Software Update page and wait until you see iOS 26.4 Beta 1 appear. You can now download and install the update to try this new Apple Music feature.\n\nOnce you're on iOS 26.4, you can open the Music app to get started with this feature. Tap the Library tab in the bottom bar, and then select the New Playlist button in the top-right corner. You should see the Playlist Playground feature here. (Note that this feature may not appear on devices that don't support Apple Intelligence, or if your Apple Account is from a region where Apple has restricted the rollout of AI features.)\n\nOnce you activate the feature, you'll be able to generate playlists with AI. From here, you tell the AI what you want to listen to. You could get specific, with certain artists, songs, or genres, or ask for playlists that encompass a certain idea of mood. Apple has some pre-written prompts to get you started, such as \"hip-hop party songs,\" but you can use your own text prompts too. AI-generated playlists have 25 songs by default, and you do have the option to customize the playlist further after it's created. You'll also be able to edit the title, cover image, and the description of AI-generated playlists. These playlists can be shared with others or displayed on your Apple Music profile, just like other playlists you create on the streaming service. It's similar in concept to other AI playlist generators on platforms like Spotify or YouTube Music.\n\nWhile Apple Music's Playlist Playground feature is a good start, it's not yet available to those of us who are unwilling to install developer beta versions of iOS 26. If that's you, there are other options out there for AI generated Apple Music playlists. There's the aforementioned ChatGPT integration, of course, but you could also use a third-party app, like PlaylistAI. It has many prompts for you to get started with, and can even generate playlists from music festival posters. The app does prompt you to get a subscription, but you can skip that prompt and use the free tier to generate a playlist quickly.",

    "title": "Apple's Next macOS Update Could Extend the Lifespan of Your MacBook's Battery",
    "description": "You can set charge limits for your MacBook.",
    "fullText": "With iOS 18, Apple introduced a feature that allowed you to set a charge limit on your iPhone. The goal was to extend the lifespan of the battery, by limiting how often you fully charge it up. Batteries age with each full charging cycle, so by preventing your battery from charging to 100% every time you keep it plugged in, you can slow down that aging process, which means your device will last longer in between charges.\n\nNow, that same feature is coming to your Mac. Apple is currently testing the feature as part of macOS 26.4, which means you'll soon be able to ask macOS to stop charging your laptop once the battery level hits a specific charge level. This feature is great for anyone that keeps their MacBook plugged in all the time while working: It'll allow you to ask your MacBook to stop charging when the battery is at 80%, or at any charge level up to 100%.\n\nTo be clear, your MacBook ships with a battery optimization feature already, which is enabled by default. This feature automatically slows down your MacBook's charging speed once the charge level reaches 80%. Based on your past usage habits, macOS waits to continue charging your MacBook until it thinks you'll need to use the laptop again. So, if you plug in your MacBook at night, and you typically take it off the charger at 8 a.m., it might keep your MacBook at 80% until 7 a.m., then charge the extra 20% over the following hour.\n\nYou can check if it's enabled by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your Mac's screen, and going to System Settings > Battery. Click the i button next to Battery Health and you'll see that Optimized Battery Charging is enabled.\n\nBut this is all automated, based on how you use your MacBook. What makes this new charging feature different is that you set the charge limit manually. That way, if you work with your MacBook plugged in all day, it doesn't need to charge to 100% whenever it thinks it should. Instead, you can keep it at any charge limit between 80% and 100%.\n\nThis new feature is available with macOS 26.4, which is currently available in the Developer Beta channel for Mac updates. I strongly recommend against installing this on your primary MacBook, as issues with the beta could mean losing data or bricking your laptop. Unless Apple decides to pull the feature, it should ship to everyone with the general release of macOS 26.4.\n\nIf you have a spare MacBook where you've installed macOS 26.4 beta, you can go to System Settings > Battery, where you'll see the \"Charge Limit\" feature listed under Battery Health. Here, you can manually limit the maximum charging level between 80% and 100%.\n\nWhile Apple's methods to reduce battery aging are good enough for most people, you can do a lot more with third-party battery management apps. Those apps will allow you to do more than just set a charge limit. For instance, you can start charging the Mac when the battery hits 50% and stop charging when it's at 80%, or stop charging if the battery is too hot.",

    "fullText": "Dana Eden, an Israeli producer best known for co-creating the Apple TV show “Tehran,” was found dead on Sunday in Athens, where the show’s fourth season was being filmed, Greek police said.\n\nEden, 52, was found dead in a hotel room after a relative made several failed attempts to reach her. Police said that her death is being treated as a suicide, Reuters reported.\n\n“We mourn the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series and programs at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan, Israel’s public broadcaster, said in a statement.\n\nKan said that Eden had traveled to Greece to oversee the “complex and significant production” of the fourth season of “Tehran,” a spy thriller that premiered in 2020 and received an International Emmy Award in 2021 for best drama series.\n\n“Her professional work, uncompromising commitment and love of creation have left a deep mark on the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation,” Kan added.\n\n“Tehran” follows the plight of Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent born in Iran but raised in Israel who returns to Iran on a mission to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program. Since Israelis are banned from visiting Iran, the show was filmed in Athens, due to its similarities with the Iranian capital.\n\nIn her Emmy acceptance speech, Eden said that working on the show with Iranian actors who had fled the regime showed her that “we have a lot in common.”\n\n“Tehran is not only an espionage series. It’s also about understanding the human behind your enemy,” she said. “I hope we can walk together – the Iranians and the Israelis, in Jerusalem and in Tehran – as friends, and not as enemies.”\n\nMuch of Eden’s work was in collaboration with Shula Spiegel, who also worked as a producer on “Tehran.” The pair’s production company, Dana and Shula Productions, said Eden’s death was “a moment of great pain for the family, friends and colleagues.”\n\nMiki Zohar, Israel’s culture minister, said he received the news of Eden’s death “with great sadness,” praising her as “one of the most prominent and influential producers in the Israeli television industry.”\n\n“Dana left a deep mark on Israeli creation and brought our story to international stages with pride, talent and courage. I share in the sorrow of the family, friends and colleagues. May her memory be a blessing,” Zohar said.\n\nCNN’s Tal Shalev contributed reporting.",

Monday's news signals that Apple is moving more aggressively into video as its rivals in the podcast space continue to invest heavily in the format.\n\n\"We're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts,\" Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, said in a statement.\n\nApple said the update would also offer new revenue opportunities for creators. Podcasters using participating hosting providers will be able to insert video ads — including host-read spots — into episodes distributed on Apple Podcasts, tapping into a broader video advertising market.\n\nAt launch, Apple plans to work with hosting and ad platforms including Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio, and SiriusXM.\n\nThe new video streaming system is expected to roll out this spring across iPhone, iPad, Apple Vision Pro, and the web.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless.\n\nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.\n\nThe feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)\n\nYou'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.\n\nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.\n\nApple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

Vision Pro M5 users can stream 8K videos, and premium YouTube members can download videos directly to their headsets, a must for long flights.\n\nGoogle, YouTube's parent company, has apparently been working on the app for a while. In 2024, a spokesperson confirmed that a standalone Vision Pro app was \"on our roadmap,\" but until today, the only way Vision users could watch YouTube on their headsets was through the Safari web browser.\n\nThe new YouTube app is designed to fit into Vision's spatial computing environments. \"Rather than just responding to different screen sizes, we needed something that responds to different spaces, volumes and use cases,\" YouTube's senior UX designer Brendan Polley told Apple. \"We built an entirely new design system that isolated core elements—comments, the play button, 'like' and 'dislike'—to fit any layout.\"\n\nHaving downloaded the app, it works exactly as intended.

Before he was appointed by President Donald Trump as FTC chair in 2025, he vowed to \"end Big Tech's vendetta against competition and free speech.\"\n\nThe FTC warning is the latest snag in Cook's political tightrope walk. The iPhone maker took a hit last year from the Trump administration's tariff policies, though smartphones, computers, and some other electronics were exempt from the most aggressive tariffs.

    "title": "Two Years Later, Is the Apple Vision Pro Even Worth It",
    "description": "Let's take one last trip into the cyberverse with Apple Vision Pro.",
    "fullText": "I'm the latest early-adopter in history. I finally got my hands on an Apple Vision Pro VR/AR headset, two years after launch, and I feel like I'm showing up at a party at 4 a.m., just in time to watch the last stragglers call for Ubers. Back in the more innocent days of 2024, Apple said the Vision Pro would be \"the beginning of a new era for computing,\" but it's become an industry cautionary tale, proof that making a product that's better than everything else on the market (arguably) doesn't guarantee squat.\n\nI've had this thing strapped to my face nearly 24/7 for the last week, and it's a frustrating device. It's insanely cool, among the most impressive pieces of hardware I've ever used, but I don't need to have it. It struggles to answer the most basic question: \"What would I actually do with this thing?\" The same question was asked by many when it launched, and from my late-comer perspective, the answer has yet to arrive.\n\nI love the design of the Vision Pro. The aluminum grey and orange accent with bubbled-out faceplate screams \"NASA moon mission.\" It looks like it's going to take you into orbit. It's so sleek: A single piece of rounded glass acts as both an optical lens for the cameras and a display for the Eyesight feature where people can see your eyes outside the headset. The aluminum alloy frame curves around your face and the cushy light shield snaps on magnetically. The fit and finish (as they used to say in car magazines) is top-notch too. Nothing rattles. No knob or button feels chintzy. There's a heft and solidness to the Vision Pro that makes it clear that this is equipment, not a toy.\n\nBut that makes it fairly heavy too. A Vision Pro weighs between 26.4 and 28.2 ounces, about the weight of an iPad Pro and a half. The headband (much improved with the newest version of the Vision Pro) and external battery do a ton to keep it from feeling saggy, but after awhile—maybe an hour or two depending on your neck muscles—you definitely feel the weight.\n\nI could get into the tech specs of the Vision Pro, the micro-OLED displays and dual-chip architecture, with M2 and R1 processors and all that, but the important part is what the tech does: blow your mind.\n\nAfter a painless set up, the first thing I did with the Vision Pro was check out \"Encounter Dinosaurs,\" a free app that comes with the device. In it, a window opens to a prehistoric world. I'm sitting there enjoying the dinosaur drama on 10-foot tall virtual screen, a little shook at how perfectly defined it is, when the damn Rajasaurus sticks its entire head into my living room. Then it makes eye contact. Genuinely feeling like prey, I said, \"holy crap\" out loud, and the thing reacted. It all feels entirely real. The lighting matches your room lighting. The sound comes from all around you. It's jaw-dropping.\n\nI was ready to go on a full dinosaur adventure in my new space helmet, but then the tech demo ended. It's a few minutes of dazzle. \"Encounter Dinosaurs\" encapsulates the overall experience of the Vision Pro—it's a tease, the suggestion of space flight, only to find you're the third backup astronaut who might get to go to the moon, if congress doesn't cut Apollo's spending first.\n\nBut the tech is so good. The eye-scanning, gesture-based UI (no controllers here) is flawless and feels like you're operating a computer with your mind. The spatial audio is pristine. The integration with other Mac gear is seamless. The definition and brightness of the graphics is perfect—no pixels visible at all. You can even use it to do things.\n\nI'm totally spatially computing right now. I'm looking at a wide-screen version of the display from my laptop floating before me, with a music app open and Olympic skiing in another window. I'm combining my laptop screen with apps from my helmet, sizing and arranging everything in virtual space, and navigating with my eyes and gestures. Everything works great. It's like living in the future. And the future is exhausting. It's not just the weight of the headset becoming more noticeable with each moment or the eyestrain headache I can feel coming on, it's the maximalism of it; it's too much. I'm sure some people dig it, but I feel like I need to escape, maybe to a nice beach or something.\n\nBut the Vision Pro's streaming is excellent, as good or better than your TV, whether you're watching movies from major streaming services, getting fully immersed in an NBA game or Metallica concert (both amazing, by the way), or just scrolling TikTok. The colors are brilliant. There's no hint of edge-blurriness. The dual micro-OLED displays create a virtual screen that's approximately 3660 x 3200 pixels per eye. That's better than 4K, on a display that can be as big as a movie screen. No notes.\n\nGaming is more of mixed bag. It's clear gamers weren't Apple's primary focus with the Vision Pro. You can link the Vision Pro to your PC or Mac for more complex games, but there aren't any real \"AAA\" games developed specifically for the device. There are some cool smaller titles, though. I was very impressed with recently released Retrocade, a collection of perfect ports of 1980s arcade games. They're the best ports I've ever played, because you play them on perfect virtual recreation of actual arcade cabinets, detailed down to reflections on the CRT screens. But it's kind of sad that the best gaming use of 2026's most advanced consumer technology is playing Frogger. There's so much possibility here, but the Vision Pro gaming section of the app store is a lonely place. I downloaded some random games—a shooter, a horror game—all glorified tech demoes. Overall, the Vision Pro apps in the App Store are few and mostly forgettable. Two years in, the ecosystem hasn't developed, which is a shame, given the possibilities.\n\nI'm not sure what I actually want from the Vision Pro. It's advanced technology that you can use to privately stream movies at extremely high quality, play a few mildly diverting games, or get some work done in a new way. Shouldn't that be enough? Maybe. Mine is borrowed, but if I had dropped $3,500 for a Vision Pro, I would not think, \"This was a wise use of my money.\" It's not just the money, though, it's also the friction.\n\nWhile full-immersion virtual reality is possible with the Apple Vision Pro, the focus has always been on augmented reality—real life, just with digital bells and whistles—but it's not really augmented reality. You can walk around with the headset on, but you're seeing the world through some cameras, with a field of view of 100° X 75°, about half of reality's FOV. And the outward looking cameras aren't nearly as good as the display, so \"reality\" is blurry around the edges, where \"augmented\" is clear as day. As good as the tech is, it still feels unsettling and alienating to use, particularly the transition from augmented life to just life. That sense of fakeness plus the strapping-a-heavy-thing-on-your-face factor adds up to it feeling like a chore to use a Vision Pro. It's the kind of device I'd use sparingly—pull it out to show a friend how cool it is or bring it on my next flight—but I haven't seen a killer app that overcomes the pain-in-the-ass factor enough to use it more often than that.\n\nOk, except that dinosaur thing. I want augmented reality to be that, but for longer than a few minutes. I want the transformative, the transcendent, something you couldn't experience any other way to make the weight and digital claustrophobia feel worth it. Sadly, it seems unlikely that Apple will be putting out the Apple Vision 2 any time soon. The future is smart glasses, and it's going to be a few years (if ever) for augmented reality to get closer to reality-reality in a pair of spectacles. Until then, I'll be waiting for the dinosaurs to come back.",

    "description": "The vulnerability may have been exploited in an \"extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\"",
    "fullText": "It's once again time to update your Apple devices. The company just released a whole host of security patches, including a fix for an actively exploited zero-day affecting iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe. These updates arrived alongside the official release of iOS 26.3, which includes features like more seamless data transfer between iPhone and Android. Other security patches address bugs in Photos, VoiceOver, and Screenshots, to name a few.\n\nAccording to Apple's latest security bulletin, the zero-day—tracked as CVE-2026-20700—is a memory corruption issue in dyld, Apple's \"Dynamic Link Editor.\" The flaw could allow attackers with memory write capability to execute arbitrary code—or, in other words, run their own code on your device.\n\nApple says that the vulnerability may have been exploited in an \"extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in earlier versions of iOS alongside CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529. Those at greatest risk with this bug are likely high-profile users with access to sensitive data—users who might be inclined to use Apple's Lockdown Mode—but everyone should install the update to patch the issue.\n\nThe patch for this flaw is available for the following iOS and iPadOS devices, in addition to all Macs that run macOS Tahoe:\n\niPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later\n\niPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later\n\niPad Air 3rd generation and later\n\niPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nYou should have automatic updates enabled to ensure you receive critical security patches ASAP, but you can confirm that you're on the latest OS version under Settings > General > Software Update. As a reminder, Apple won't message you urging you to click links, download attachments, or install apps related to security updates.

    "title": "Apple's Big AI Siri Plans Are Once Again Delayed",
    "description": "The new Siri was supposed to launch with iOS 26.4.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Apple fan who closely follows tech news, you might have been looking forward to Siri's big AI overhaul for some time now—specifically, since the company initially announced it at WWDC 2024. But despite delay after delay, rumors have strongly suggested that the next generation of Siri is set to launch with iOS 26.4. And seeing as Apple just released iOS 26.3 this week, AI Siri is closer than ever, right? Wrong.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has once again kicked Siri's big updates down the road. According to Gurman, the company really did intend to release AI Siri with iOS 26.4, which is reportedly planned to release sometime in March. However, due to testing \"snags,\" the company is instead planning to break up Siri's major updates and distribute them across several iOS updates. Gurman notes that likely means iOS 26.5, which could launch in May, and iOS 27, which will likely release in September, if it follows Apple's usual release dates. But looking at Apple's track record here, don't hold your breath.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple is struggling to get Siri to \"properly process queries,\" or to actually respond fast enough, both of which would defeat the purpose of using a smart assistant. Apple is reportedly pushing engineers to use iOS 26.5 to test these features, particularly the ability for Siri to use your personal data to answer questions. Users may be able to flip a switch in Settings to \"preview\" these features, and may treat the rollout as a beta.\n\nEngineers are also struggling to get Siri's app intents to work, or the feature that lets Siri take actions on your behalf. You could ask Siri to open an image, edit it, then share it with a friend, but only if the feature itself actually works. This, too, may roll out with iOS 26.5, but it's unclear due to reliability issues. Siri is also cutting off user prompts too soon, and sometimes taps into ChatGPT instead of using Apple's underlying tech—which would look pretty bad for the company.\n\nApple is also testing new AI features for iOS 26.5 that we haven't heard of yet. One is a new web search tool that functions like other AI search features from companies like Perplexity and Google. You ask a question to search on the web, and it returns a report with summaries and links. The other new feature is a custom image generation tool, that builds on Image Playground, but that too is hitting development hurdles.\n\nLooking even further ahead, Apple is planning more Siri advancements—namely, giving the assistant chatbot features, à la ChatGPT. (That said, it will reportedly use Gemini to power these features.) This version of Siri may even have its own app.\n\nIt seems Siri really is Apple's albatross. Despite arguably popularizing smart assistants for the general population, Siri quickly fell behind compared to the likes of Alexa and Gemini (née Google Assistant). Now, the latter have fully embraced modern generative AI, offering features like contextual awareness and natural language commands. While Amazon and Google users can ask their assistants increasingly complicated questions, Siri still feels designed mostly to handle setting alarms and checking the weather.\n\nThat was going to change with iOS 18, alongside Apple Intelligence as a whole. Apple's initial pitch for AI Siri was an assistant that could see what's on your phone to better understand questions you ask, and take actions on your behalf—i.e., app intents. You could ask Siri to edit an image you have pulled up on your Photos app, and because the assistant is contextually aware, it would know what image you mean, and apply the edits you ask for. Or, you could ask when your friend was set to arrive, and the assistant would be able to scan messages and emails to know that, one, your friend is visiting town this weekend, and two, that they sent you their flight itinerary that gets them into the airport at 3:55 p.m.\n\nThis Siri has never launched, however. While the company has rolled out iterative updates to Siri with some AI-powered features, its overhaul with these ambitious features have been a trial for Apple's AI team. It all stems from Apple's issues with AI in general: The company was caught off guard by the generative AI wave kicked off in late 2022 by OpenAI's ChatGPT, and following some resistance from corporate leadership, have been scrambling to keep up ever since. Apple Intelligence launched half-baked with issues of its own, but rather than launch a half-baked AI Siri, the company has been struggling to build up the assistant internally.\n\nPart of the problem is privacy-\n\nApple is the second most valuable tech company in the world, but a host of factors—including with software, hardware, and leadership—have made it so even Apple can't magically produce an AI assistant. Though, I'm not sold that an AI Siri will move units for Apple in the first place. I can't imagine Gemini moves people to Android, and you can download ChatGPT on any device you own. It's even now built into your iPhone.",

    "fullText": "Apple (AAPL) is ramping up for an eventful spring. It's the kind of “quietly huge” setup that AAPL stock investors love.\n\nIt plans several launches. One big narrative will dominate. And the scoreboard couldn't be clearer.\n\nFor me, the narrative unfolds with the latest Apple earnings. CEO Tim Cook was dealing in superlatives when he described the December quarter as a “remarkable, record-breaking quarter.”\n\nApple reported $143.8 billion in revenue and said its installed base topped 2.5 billion active devices. That's the type of scale that makes even \"boring\" refreshes become important events in the ecosystem.\n\nBut the scoreboard is starting to shift. In the earnings call, Cook said Apple continues to see \"market pricing for memory increasing significantly.\"\n\nThe comments suggest that Apple is issuing a reminder: The next few quarters may be less about demand and more about protecting its margins.\n\nI am sure you've seen examples within your family of those who want to cling to their old, perfectly functional iPhones. The most common reason, at least in my experience, is that the new ones are too expensive.\n\nNow the biggest-name users connected to the iPhone are Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg. I'm confident their wallets will not get lighter due to the newest version of the iPhone.\n\nHowever, Apple aims to prioritize the needs of the average user this time. It's why in the next wave, it wants to make things more affordable, focusing on margin growth to widen the funnel.\n\nThe launch of iPhone 17e is imminent, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.\n\nIt will carry four upgrades that matter in the real world. A19, MagSafe (as described by The Verge), Apple’s newer C1X modem, and its N1 connectivity chip are the upgrades included in what's launching “imminently.”\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nI bet you're thinking, \"Hey, I know a person who skipped the cheaper iPhone because it felt like a 'yes, but…' device.\" However, MagSafe is looking to shake things up with car mounts, wallets, charging stands, and the whole accessory ecosystem.\n\nAnd Apple is reportedly keeping the price at $599, targeting emerging markets and enterprise buyers. These buyers, in principle, care about reliability and total cost of ownership more than status.\n\nThe spring iPad story is simple and basic. The focus is on the same shells, with faster chips.\n\nThe entry iPad is expected to jump to A18, according to Mac Rumors. That will bring Apple Intelligence support to Apple’s cheapest tablet for the first time.\n\nIf you're the person everyone contacts when an older iPad begins to slow, this is the type of update that matters.\n\nA base model that can operate Apple’s AI features cleanly gives Apple a straightforward pitch for schools, families, and companies that purchase in bulk.\n\nHardware is responsible for selling units, but software sells trust.\n\nGurman’s reporting says Apple will release the first developer beta of iOS 26.4 the week of Feb. 23.\n\nSiri will also be available again after a lengthy wait. Apple Intelligence parts are likely to pop up there.\n\nThe recent upgrades are not eye-popping. I hate it when we speak in hyperbolic terms about any stock. That is what I like about the recent upgrades.\n\nMaxim upgraded Apple to buy from hold (PT $300).\n\nKGI Securities upgraded Apple to outperform from neutral (PT $306).\n\nSeparately, J.P. Morgan reiterated its overweight rating and lifted its target to $315.\n\nThe short-term push-pull trajectory is evident, though. Demand, all things considered, remains very strong. However, the pricing strain of components, particularly memory, is becoming more pronounced.\n\nApple is not traditional when it comes to revenue guidance.\n\nHere are two simple ways investors frame the next quarter.\n\nBack-of-the-envelope range (year-over-year growth off last year’s March quarter): Apple did $95.4B in fiscal Q2 2025 revenue. If Apple prints +10% to +12% YoY (roughly in line with where many sell-side expectations cluster), that implies about $104.9 billion to $106.8 billion this March quarter.\n\n“Street” snapshot (consensus-style framing): FactSet estimates cited by Investor's Business Daily peg the March quarter around $104.9 billion in revenue and $1.84 EPS.\n\nHowever, there is a margin factor as well. Apple is guiding toward a gross margin for the ongoing quarter at 48% to 49%; Cook is flagging memory expenses as a growing headwind beyond Q2.",

    "description": "Here's what's new with Apple's sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "It's officially time for another iPhone update: Apple dropped iOS 26.3 for compatible iPhones on Wednesday, following nearly two months of beta testing. Unlike iOS 26 itself, or even iOS 26.1 and iOS 26.2, iOS 26.3 isn't exactly feature-filled. But there are some interesting (and important) changes that are worth noting, including an easier way to leave iPhone altogether.\n\nBack in December, we learned about a small but substantial new iOS feature: an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless. In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Tap it, and iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device; from there, you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nApple actually worked with Google directly on this feature, which means it doesn't just go one way: Android users will have a similar option on their end to transfer to iPhone. But those of us updating our iPhones to iOS 26.3 now have an easier escape route if we choose to switch platforms.\n\nWith iOS 26.3, Apple is giving certain users the ability to stop sharing their precise location with their cellular network providers. The new feature, \"Limit Precise Location,\" reduces the exactness of the location data that is shared with cellular networks. That way, the network can determine your general location, but not your precise location. What that means in practical terms, at least according to Apple, is that the network might know what neighborhood you're in, but not the exact street address.\n\nAt this time, only Boost Mobile users in the U.S. will be able to use this feature with iOS 26.3. It also only works with some iOS devices, including the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro M5 Wi-Fi + Cellular. Hopefully, this will make its way to more cellular plans and more iPhones in the future, but for now, it's a pretty limited feature. While most of us won't be able to limit precise location sharing with the network, we can at least stop apps from harvesting this data.\n\nTalk about a small update: With iOS 26.3, Apple is breaking \"Weather\" and \"Astronomy\" into their own wallpaper sections. (Previously, these two categories were paired.) While Astronomy features the standard space wallpapers found in iOS 26.2 and earlier, Weather now features three preset wallpapers, with different font options and weather widgets.\n\nBack in September, we learned Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the E.U, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAs it happens, this feature is now launching with iOS 26.3—albeit, only in the EU (With the first iOS 26.3 beta, Apple added a “Notification Forwarding” option in Notification settings for all iPhones. They have since removed this option, since the feature is EU-only.) While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nEU iPhone users are also getting another interesting feature with iOS 26.3. The new update will allow users to pair third-party accessories with their iPhones by bringing the devices close together, similar to how pairing AirPods to iPhones works. Developers will need to add this functionality to their devices before this works, of course, but the new update makes it possible.\n\nApple typically bundles its feature updates, like iOS 26.3, with stability patches, including for bugs and security vulnerabilities. This update is no different. Apple's security notes for iOS 26.3 list 37 patches for security vulnerabilities, covering issues across iOS. The most important by far patches an issue with dyld, Apple's \"Dynamic Link Editor,\" which Apple says may have been used in a \"sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\" The company has used this language before, usually referring to attacks against high-profile users from governments or large organizations. As such, most users likely won't be affected by this bug, but better safe than sorry: update ASAP.\n\nOther important security updates include a patch for a Photos bug that could let someone access your photos from the Lock Screen; a fix for a Screenshots issue that could let an attacker see your deleted notes; a patch for a UIKit bug that could let someone take screenshots of sensitive data when using iPhone Mirroring with Mac; and a fix for a VoiceOver bug that could let an attacker view sensitive information even when your iPhone is locked.",

    "fullText": "Critics brand deal with regulator as ‘lightweight’ with ‘no legal bite’ as tech giants avoid legally binding measures\n\nApple and Google have committed to avoid discriminating against apps that compete with their own products under an agreement with the UK’s competition watchdog, as they avoided legally binding measures for their mobile platforms.\n\nThe US tech companies have vowed to be more transparent about vetting third-party apps before letting them on their app stores and not discriminate against third-party apps in app search rankings.\n\nThey have also agreed not to use data from third-party apps unfairly, such as using information about app updates to tweak their own offerings.\n\nApple has also committed to giving app developers an easier means of requesting use of its features such as the digital wallet, and live translation for AirPod users.\n\nThe commitments have been secured as part of a new regulatory regime overseen by the Competition and Markets Authority, (CMA), which has the power to impose changes on how Apple and Google operate their mobile platforms after deciding last year that they had “substantial, entrenched” market power.\n\nHowever, the CMA has opted to allow voluntary commitments rather than impose formal changes.\n\nTom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director who represents app developers challenging Apple and Google’s dominance of the mobile platform market, said the changes were “lightweight” and had no legal bite.\n\nThe CMA did not name specific Google and Apple apps that compete with third-party rivals but both firms offer their own music services in the form of YouTube Music and Apple Music. Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.\n\nHowever, the commitments do not cover a significant bugbear for app developers – the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.\n\nThe CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.\n\nSarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.\n\nThe CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.\n\nSmith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.\n\n“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”\n\nThe News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.",

    "fullText": "Secure, noise-cancelling Bluetooth earbuds that shine for exercise and everyday use on Android and iPhone\n\nApple’s revamped compact workout Beats earbuds stick to a winning formula, while slimming down and improving comfort.\n\nThe new Powerbeats Fit are the direct successors to 2022’s popular Beats Fit Pro, costing £200 (€230/$200/A$330). They sit alongside the recently redesigned Powerbeats Pro 2 as Apple’s fitness alternatives of the AirPods.\n\nThe Fit take Beats’ standard earbud design and add a flexible silicone stabiliser wing that curves around the inside of your concha, rather than around the outside of your ear like the Pro 2. The result is a far more compact and discreet earbud – particularly if you opt for a subtler colour than spark orange – and one that’s more comfortable to wear with glasses.\n\nOnce twisted into place, the earbuds stayed firmly in my ears regardless of how vigorously I shook my head or how wet I got running in the rain. The new wing is a little more comfortable for extended periods than their predecessors, but I still found it put uncomfortable pressure on the inside of my left ear after an hour or so.\n\nA single button on each earbud takes care of playback and noise cancelling controls, or can be set to adjust volume on a press and hold. Call quality is very good – particularly for earbuds without stalks – sounding relatively natural and clear even when speaking softly in quiet environments and only allowing a little background noise through on busy streets.\n\nThe battery in the earbuds lasts a good six hours of playback with noise cancelling and can be charged three times in the case for a total of 24 hours use before needing to be connected to power by USB-C.\n\nThe earbuds have Apple’s older H1 chip for managing connectivity, which means a seamless connection to the iPhone and other Apple gear with spatial audio, music sharing and Siri. But the Beats app on Android offers many of the same advanced features, including instant pairing, customisation, updates and battery widgets, making them cross-compatible and ideal for people who use both platforms.\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC, H1 chip\n\nBattery life: six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)\n\nWater resistance: buds and case IPX4 (splash resistant)\n\nEarbud dimensions: 27.4 x 21.5 x 20.4mm\n\nCharging case dimensions: 62.5 x 55.4 x 27.5mm\n\nThe Beats sound far better than your average workout buds and are good enough to be general listening earphones. They produce fairly balanced sound with plenty of powered in the low end when required, good separation of tones and decent detail in the mids and highs. They are quite similar to the Powerbeats Pro 2 and do a great job with punchier rock, pop, hip-hop or electronic tracks, but fall short of the AirPods Pro 3.\n\nUnlike most workout buds the Beats have active noise cancellation, which works pretty well to dampen the drone of road noise or the commute. It can’t handle the difficult higher tones, such as clicks, taps and background chatter as well as the Powerbeats Pro or the best-in-class AirPods Pro 3, but it does the job most of the time.\n\nThe earbuds also have a good and natural-sounding transparency mode, which helps with awareness while out running. But like the Powerbeats Pro 2 it isn’t quite as good as not having anything in your ears, so is still best used in safer environments such as parks.\n\nApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.\n\nThe earbuds are not repairable but Apple will offer individual replacements for lost or damaged parts, including a £69 battery service. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Fit cost £199.95 (€229.95/$199.99/A$329.95).\n\nFor comparison, the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 cost £250, the Beats Studio Buds+ cost £180, the Beats Solo Buds cost £80 and the AirPods Pro 3 cost £219.\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Fit are a minor revamp on the already great Beats Fit Pro bringing them into line with the rest of Apple’s earbuds.\n\nThey aren’t as comfortable or accomplished on the audio or noise-cancelling fronts as the AirPods Pro 3. Nor are they quite as great for running as the Powerbeats Pro 2 with their volume rocker buttons. But the Fit are easier to live with on the commute without the big over-ear hooks and more comfortable to wear with glasses without sacrificing the secure fit.\n\nThat makes them great workout buds that can pull double-duty as regular earbuds with good enough noise cancelling and great sound. Plus they have most of the fancy features of AirPods with Apple gear and full compatibility with Android thanks to the Beats app. Not many earbuds can claim that privilege.\n\nPros: secure fit, good sound, solid noise cancelling and transparency modes, decent battery life, good case, good call quality, spatial audio, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.\n\nCons: expensive for workout buds, no multipoint connectivity, ear hook can be uncomfortable after a while, battery can’t be replaced making them ultimately disposable.",

    "description": "One of these companies is not like the others....",
    "fullText": "One of these companies is not like the others.\n\nIf you’ve been following the Big Tech companies’ earnings reports, you know that they’re pouring more than ever into capital expenditure to pursue their AI futures.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft all spent record sums last quarter on purchases of property and equipment — largely tied AI chips and data centers. And for the companies that offered forward-looking guidance, their capex plans for the year blew analysts’ already generous estimates out of the water.\n\nAmazon expects its 2026 capex to surge to $200 billion. Google is aiming for $175 billion to $185 billion. Meta estimates it will spend between $115 billion and $135 billion. All of those figures came in well above expectations and, for the most part, have weighed on their stocks. Microsoft didn’t give a formal 2026 capex outlook, but if its peers are any indication, spending will likely exceed the roughly $114 billion Wall Street expects for the calendar year.\n\nOf the Big Tech companies, just one stands apart this earnings season. Apple’s capital expenditure, already just a fraction of its peers, actually declined in the December quarter from a year earlier.\n\nFor better or worse, Apple has struck its own path with AI. As we’ve argued before, it’s embracing AI but is not an AI company. Instead, it’s chosen a hybrid model, relying on both first- and third-party data centers — a move that keeps a significant amount of infrastructure spending off its balance sheet. And while Apple has said it expects capex to increase as it invests more heavily in AI, particularly to support its Private Cloud Compute, those outlays remain minimal compared with its peers.\n\nYou can see that approach reflected in Apple’s decision to use Google’s Gemini, rather than an in-house model, to power the next generation of Siri and Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Google deal, reportedly worth about $1 billion a year, gives Apple access to a top-tier AI model for pennies on the dollar compared to what other Big Tech companies are spending to build their own.\n\nOf course, it also means Apple won’t fully own a technology that some see as powering the next industrial revolution. But if that revolution fails to materialize — or takes longer than expected — Apple won’t be left holding the most expensive bag in Silicon Valley history.",

    "title": "10 Fitness Hacks Every Apple Watch User Should Know",
    "description": "These are the essential settings tweaks, lesser-known features, and apps you'll love for workouts.",
    "fullText": "The Apple Watch is a powerful tool for following and tracking exercise. We’ve already shown you 10 hacks for all Apple Watch users, but I’m here with a follow-up on the fitness features, specifically. With these lesser-known settings, apps, and features, you can get more out of your workouts and your health data.\n\nThe Apple Watch’s Fitness app famously includes three rings (Move, Exercise, Stand) that you can close with activity throughout the day. Not only should you change your Move and Exercise goals to numbers that work for you (raising or lowering them as appropriate), you can also schedule in different goals for each day.\n\nOriginally, your Move, Exercise, and Stand goals were the same every day, but these days you can change your ring-closing goals, including adding rest days. Go to the Fitness app and tap the Activity Rings card, and then tap the “+/-” icon next to each goal. You can create a weekly schedule so that you have lower targets on certain days. You can also change a goal temporarily just for today—for example, reducing your Stand hour goal on a day you’re taking a road trip.\n\nThe Apple Watch is meant to be worn on the wrist, but that doesn’t mean you have to wear it there. If your workout has you snatching kettlebells or bench pressing in wrist wraps, consider wearing the Watch on your upper arm. Or if you use a standing desk, your steps may not register unless you put the Watch on your ankle. Both of these locations will likely require a bigger wristband than what came with the Watch. Fortunately, you can buy an extra-long band, like this one.\n\nThis is a tiny hack, but one that makes it so much easier to operate your watch mid-workout: Press the crown, and you’ll see all your installed apps. By default, they appear as little icons clustered together. You can rearrange them if you like, but no matter the arrangement, they’re tough to accurately tap while you’re running down the street. Make life easier on yourself by scrolling to the bottom of this screen, and tap List View. This puts your apps in an alphabetical list, with the name next to each icon. It’s now far easier to tap anything you might need during your workout.\n\nThe Apple Watch collects a lot of data, but Apple doesn’t give you a convenient way to view it all in one place. The Fitness app has workout data, and the Health app stores everything else—but the Health app isn’t as user-friendly as you might wish. Third-party apps have stepped in to fill the gap. Bevel, for example, provides recovery scores and collects data in much the same way you’d see from a Whoop or Oura ring. There are other apps that do the same thing, like Athlytic, but I’m recommending Bevel because it has a free tier (and most of its functionality is on that tier). If you like the experience, consider shopping around to see if you prefer other apps.\n\nThe Workout app on Apple Watch has evolved quite a bit from its original format as a simple tracker with a start and stop button. The current version of the Fitness app has a little timer icon in the corner of each workout type, under the Workouts tab. Tap that, and you can view and edit custom workouts. Program yourself an interval workout, or a workout of a specific length. You can do this most easily from your phone—Apple has instructions here.\n\nIf you run or bike the same route often, try the Race Route feature. Routes are automatically generated after you do the same run twice. On the Watch itself, go to the Workout app and choose a Run or Cycle workout, then tap the timer icon to bring up options including race routes. You can choose to race your personal best time on that route, or just your last workout on that route. During the activity, you’ll see whether you’re keeping pace with that previous workout.\n\nOne of the best upgrades to iOS 26 is that the Fitness app can now track workouts even without the Apple Watch. If you left your watch at home but still want to get a run in, you can track it directly from your phone. Just go to the Fitness app, then Workout, and then tap whichever type of workout you’d like to do. If you choose an outdoor workout like a run, your phone will track your distance and pace with the phone’s GPS. If you choose an indoor workout, the app can still log the workout with a timer, but it won’t be able to collect any data. You’ll get a readout with the amount of time you worked out, and an estimate of your calorie burn, and you can rate your effort so the workout counts toward your training load. If you have a device that can measure your heart rate—like a chest strap or headphones like the Powerbeats Pro 2—you can pair that device directly to your iPhone, without involving the watch, and track your workout through the Fitness app with heart rate data intact.\n\nThe Apple Watch is pretty good at judging distance and speed outdoors when you run, and your iPhone can do a good job of that, too. But once you’re indoors on a treadmill, only the treadmill knows how far you’re running. The Apple Watch’s distance estimations aren’t always very good. That is, unless you’re using a treadmill that can beam data directly to your watch. The treadmills in a lot of commercial gyms have this feature through a system called GymKit. In your Settings on the watch, go to Workout and turn on Detect Gym Equipment. When you use a compatible gym machine, there will be a spot on the console to tap your watch. You’ll hear a beep, and then the data on your watch will be synced to the data on the machine.\n\nWe’ve seen that the stock Workout app has plenty of great features for running and other workouts, but many runners and hikers prefer a different option. The Apple Watch app WorkOutDoors gives Garmin-level mapping and data analytics during your run. It takes a bit of time to learn your way around all the features, but this is an incredibly powerful tool for just a small investment ($8.99 as a one-time charge).\n\nIf you use the Apple Watch to track your sleep, you don’t have the option of charging it while you sleep. But don’t worry if it’s close to bedtime and you’re low on battery—Apple Watches, especially the most recent models, are designed to charge quickly for exactly this reason. The Apple Watch Series 11 only needs five minutes of charge time for eight hours of sleep tracking.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that even he has \"fallen prey\" to \"the pixie dust\" of seeing Apple or Google on a résumé.",
    "fullText": "Even Elon Musk sometimes hires the wrong people.\n\n\"I've fallen prey to the pixie dust thing as well, where it's like, 'Oh, we'll hire someone from Google or Apple, and they'll be immediately successful,'\" Musk told Stripe cofounder John Collison and tech Dwarkesh Patel during a 3-hour-long appearance on a special joint episode of their podcasts.\n\nIt's why Tesla's CEO doesn't put his full faith in a candidate's résumé.\n\n\"Generally, what I tell people—I tell myself, I guess, aspirationally—is, don't look at the résumé. Just believe your interaction. The résumé may seem very impressive, and it's like, 'Wow, the résumé looks good.' But if the conversation after 20 minutes is not \"Wow,\" you should believe the conversation, not the paper,\" he said.\n\nHe said he's made other mistakes, too. \"My batting average is still not perfect, but it's very high,\" he said. That includes the times he's discounted certain personality traits.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness,\" he said. \"And I think goodness of heart is important. I underweighted that at one point. So, are they a good person? Trustworthy? Smart and talented and hard working? If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing.\"",

    "title": "Apple's 'Lockdown Mode' Could Stop the Government From Breaking Into Your iPhone",
    "description": "Lockdown Mode saved a journalist's iPhone from the FBI. Do you need it?",
    "fullText": "In January, the FBI made headlines after it raided the home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson. It was a shocking case of law enforcement not just overriding one journalist's privacy, but the integrity of the entire news organization. The devices the FBI seized—which included personal devices as well as a Washington Post-issued laptop—contained Natanson's personal contacts, correspondences, and the Slack channels of the Washington Post itself.\n\nBut while the FBI was able to access some of the devices, it was not able to access Natanson's iPhone. That's because the device was in Lockdown Mode, which prevented the FBI's Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) from breaking into it. This isn't a setting that is exclusive to journalists: You have this option baked into your iPhone as well, and can choose to turn it on at any time. The thing is, unless you're a high-profile target, you probably don't want to.\n\nLockdown Mode is an option on iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs, designed for users who could be the target of sophisticated cyberattacks. Think politicians, businessmen, activists, and, of course, journalists—really, anyone high-profile that works or takes action in a way that could draw the ire of powerful organizations or governments.\n\nBecause attackers target devices with spyware, the goal of Lockdown Mode is to reduce the attack surface of your device in order to prevent potential cyberattacks from working. Attackers can install spyware on a target's device in a number of ways, through links, attachments, wired connections, and file downloads, the same way you can install malware by clicking a malicious link in an email, or downloading a corrupt extension from the web. Lockdown Mode locks down these vulnerabilities and eliminates as many potential attack routes as possible.\n\nTo achieve this, Lockdown Mode severely impacts a number of functions you may use on your device every day. According to Apple, that includes the following:\n\nMessages: Lockdown Mode will block most message attachment types, other than \"certain images, video, and audio.\" Links and link previews are blocked.\n\nWeb browsing: The feature blocks \"complex web technologies,\" which could impact how certain websites load or function. You may not see certain web fonts, and you may see missing image icons in place of pictures.\n\nFaceTime: Incoming FaceTime calls are blocked, except for contacts you have called within the past 30 days. You can't use SharePlay or take Live Photos in FaceTime calls.\n\nApple services: Invitations to Apple services like invites to manage a smart home are blocked, unless you have previously invited that person. GameCenter will not work, and Focuses will not work \"as expected.\"\n\nDevice connections: Your device needs to be unlocked before it can communicate with another computer. In addition, your Mac also requires your explicit approval before the connection can be made.\n\nWireless connectivity: You won't automatically join non-secure wifi networks, and you will disconnect from existing non-secure wifi networks. Lockdown Mode also blocks 2G and 3G cellular support.\n\nConfiguration profiles: You can't install configuration profiles, and the device can't enroll in Mobile Device Management.\n\nApple makes a point to say that phone calls and \"plain text messages\" will work as normal, however incoming calls won't ring on your Apple Watch. Emergency SOS also will continue to work.\n\nThese restrictions make it much more difficult for a bad actor to install spyware on your device, though it also makes it more difficult to use your device. A shared album invite could contain malware, but by removing the feature entirely, you miss out on photos from friends and family. Any spyware coming from a malicious link or image will be blocked, but if you frequently send photos, videos, and other attachments in Messages, you'll miss out.\n\nThat's why these measures are really designed only for individuals who think they'll be targeted by sophisticated actors. It seems that could include governments secretly installing spyware on targets' devices, or the FBI stealing your device in a raid. It's worth noting that the FBI was able to access Natanson's other devices, including a MacBook Pro that unlocked with her fingerprint. The agency's warrant compelled Natanson to unlock her devices with biometrics if they were enabled. Lockdown Mode could not have prevented that, so it's not clear why the FBI didn't force Natanson to unlock the iPhone in question, too.\n\nIf you understand the restrictions, but still want to try Lockdown Mode, you'll need to be running the following software version on each of the Apple devices you want to use Lockdown Mode with:\n\nApple Watch: watchOS 10 or later\n\nApple says \"additional protections\" are available for iOS 17, iPadOS 17, or macOS Sonoma or later. In addition, you should update your device to the latest software version before turning on Lockdown Mode if you want all the latest protections.\n\nYou can turn on Lockdown Mode on any of your Apple devices, but you must do so individually on each. You'll find the option at the bottom of the \"Privacy & Security\" section in Settings (System Settings on Mac). Hit \"Turn On Lockdown Mode,\" then review the pop-up that appears and choose \"Turn On Lockdown Mode\" again. You'll need to choose to \"Turn On & Restart,\" then enter your device's password or passcode for the feature to take effect.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge was skeptical of President Donald Trump’s argument to try to move the appeal of his hush money conviction to federal court — after lawyers already took their shot in two other courts.\n\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein suggested Trump’s attorneys missed their chance by first taking the US Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity to the state court judge who oversaw the criminal trial and not to a federal judge until almost two months later.\n\n“You made a choice. You sought two bites at the apple,” Hellerstein told Trump’s lawyers Wednesday.\n\nHe also quizzed Trump’s lawyer over the argument that the case should move to federal court because Trump could claim as a defense that he has immunity. Calling the arguments “provocative,” he said he would issue a ruling later.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are trying to get the appeal of his hush money conviction moved into federal court where the judges could interpret challenges involving federal preemption and presidential immunity. Removal would also plow a quicker path to have the appeal heard by the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump was convicted in 2024 of 34 state charges of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDuring oral arguments on Wednesday, Hellerstein said Trump’s attorneys appeared to make a strategic decision to bring the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity first to Judge Juan Merchan, the state judge who oversaw the trial, before trying to move the case to federal court which it did 58 days after the decision came down.\n\nJeffrey Wall, an attorney for Trump, pushed back against Hellerstein’s comment that he was trying to get another bite at the apple.\n\n“It would have been disrespectful in spades” to Judge Merchan if they bypassed him, Wall said. He said they had to move quickly before the state judge because Trump was set to be sentenced by him 10 days later.\n\nHellerstein said Trump’s attorneys missed the 30-day window allowed under the statute to move the case into federal court and their burden now was whether there was “good cause” to allow them to try again.\n\n“All your doing is saying your good cause is you’re afraid to anger the state court and you want to give the state court the first chance” to rule on the Supreme Court decision before trying the argument in federal court, the judge said.\n\n“You’ve made a strategic decision. You’re seeing where you can get a better decision and that is indicative of the intent,” the judge said.\n\n“My thesis is that was fatal to you,” Hellerstein said.\n\nTrump is simultaneously appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to influence the 2016 presidential election in state court. That appeal can ultimately be brought to the US Supreme Court but it has additional layers of review.\n\nHellerstein had previously rejected Trump’s effort to move the case into federal court, finding the argument that Trump had presidential immunity didn’t apply. Trump later tried again after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. He argued the use of evidence, including testimony from Trump’s former White House advisor Hope Hicks and his tweets while in office, were improperly used and his conviction should be overturned.\n\nAt the time Hellerstein denied that motion for removal, writing, “Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts.”\n\nTrump appealed and in November the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sent it back to Hellerstein to conduct further analysis considering the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall, the attorney for Trump, argued when the Manhattan district attorney’s office introduced evidence of what they argued were official acts — such as Trump’s tweets, trial testimony from his former White House aide Hope Hicks, and testimony about conversations Trump had with his attorney general — it changed the case and now it should be moved into federal court.\n\n“The district attorney held those keys in his hand. He didn’t have to introduce that evidence at trial to prove up his case. Once he did this became a prosecution relating to those official acts,” Wall argued.\n\n“Is that enough to make it a federal case? I think the answer to that is obviously yes,” Wall said.\n\nThe attorney added, “I don’t think you have to get to the bottom of this. It’s all for the Second Circuit.”\n\nWall said that the judge doesn’t have to decide the merits of the argument on immunity, only that they have what is called a “colorable defense” to move the case into federal court.\n\nSteven Wu, an attorney for the district attorney’s office, argued that a fight over evidence is not a defense to criminal charges.\n\n“The defendant seems to assume that because evidence of official acts is introduced that somehow transforms the nature of the criminal action. That’s just not true. The charges arise out of conduct that is wholly unofficial and private,” Wu said.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s argument, while the judge was skeptical of many of Trump’s legal arguments, he acknowledged a technical maneuver that appealed to him.\n\n“That’s a delicious thought because I then dump the whole problem on the Court of Appeals,” Hellerstein said.",

    "title": "FBI stymied by Apple's Lockdown Mode after seizing journalist's iPhone",
    "description": "Post reporter was compelled to unlock MacBook Pro with fingerprint, however.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.\n\nFBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.\n\nAs previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.\n\nGovernment investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.\n\nThe Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.\n\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.\n\nCART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.\n\nThe government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”\n\nApple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”\n\nIntroduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.\n\nThe process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.\n\n“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”\n\nLockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.\n\nFBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”\n\nThe Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”\n\nNatanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:\n\nNatanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.\n\nIn 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”\n\nThe FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.\n\nThe government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.\n\nThe investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.\n\nThe government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.\n\nThe Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”\n\n“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”\n\nThe government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.\n\n“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”",

    "description": "Apple doesn't reach out to its users that way.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing scam is targeting Apple Pay users, attempting to lock them into phony support calls or emails that could see them handing over their passwords and credit card numbers. The news was first highlighted by AppleInsider and involves warnings that look suspiciously like official Apple messaging. While AppleInsider's report doesn't link to any specific user complaints of this happening, it does include example screenshots, and reports matching AppleInsider's description have popped up on both Reddit and Apple's official support forums over the last 30 days.\n\nThe scam might come over either email or text, and usually warns the recipient about a potentially fraudulent purchase made using their Apple Pay at a physical Apple Store, while offering a phone number or email to contact to address the issue. According to AppleInsider, it might also include a case ID, timestamp, or other technical details in order to appear more legitimate. One user on Reddit, for instance, considered that the scam might be a legitimate text from Apple because it included the official sounding phrase \"If this was you, no action is needed.\"\n\nHowever, inconsistencies remain, such as the scam often referring to Apple Accounts as Apple IDs, a now outdated term. Additionally, while emails might use official looking letterhead that makes them appear to come straight from Apple, mistakes could remain. For instance, an email could open with \"Hello {Name}\" instead of being addressed to the recipient's actual name. It could come from a bogus address, but even appearing to come from a legitimate source like \"[email protected]\" isn't a strong indicator that it's real, as it's possible for scammers to spoof email addresses. Overall, the idea seems to be to speed the recipient into action with an urgent tone, while using Apple's logo and a professional writing style to mask any clues as to who is really sending these notices.\n\nIf you are receiving any texts or emails about your Apple Pay activity at all, chances are they probably aren't real—Apple doesn't reach out to its users in this way. Rather than sending texts or emails, communication instead comes directly from the Wallet app. Additionally, Apple Pay serves as a medium for payment rather than as a credit or debit account in and of itself. As such, if any fraudulent transactions are detected, notices would come from your bank or credit card provider rather than Apple itself.\n\nStill, it is worth keeping an eye out for any red flags as well. Look for small typos or unusual domain names, which can help give a fake message away, even if a lack of these isn't an indicator that a message is legitimate. Also, rather than calling any provided phone numbers, consider searching for them online to see whether they've been reported as being tied to a scam operation. At any rate, do not respond to these notices, and don't provide any information (such as passwords, which Apple will never ask for) to them if you've already reached out by accident. There are better ways to verify your Apple Pay activity.\n\nIf you think a message you've received is illegitimate, the best thing you can do is ignore it and verify it independently. Instead of responding to the suspicious text or email directly, or calling any provided phone numbers, double check any claims made in the statement through official Apple channels. You can see your recent Apple Pay purchases in the Wallet app by tapping on one of your registered cards, and opening the Settings app and navigating to Media & Purchases > View Account > Purchase History will show you any recent App Store purchases. If you don't see a transaction mentioned in one of these notices in your official payment history, chance are it never happened.\n\nIf you're still in doubt you have options. Rather than reaching out to an email or phone number linked in a potential scam notice, start fresh with a new message straight to Apple's official support. You can find the proper contact details, including an official Apple phone number for your region, on Apple's website. The company will be able to determine whether it's seen any suspicious activity tied to your account.\n\nFinally, once you're certain a message is part of a scam, you can forward it (or simply report it, if forwarding isn't possible) to Apple to help the company shut it down. The specific email address you'll want to use will differ based on the type of message, and you can find all your options on Apple's support website, under \"How to report suspicious emails, messages, and calls.\" Once you've sent the message to the correct channels, delete it from your inbox to keep yourself from accidentally clicking any compromised links. As added security, also consider changing your Apple Account password, or using a password manager.",

    "fullText": "Google has been on a monumental tear as of late. Can it keep the good times rolling?\n\nWhen Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will focus on AI spending, cloud wins, and a big Apple deal.\n\nWith Meta projecting its capex for this year to nearly double that of 2025, how high will Google go? The company said in October that it expected capex for 2025 to land between $91 and $93 billion. Investors will track if it sticks to those goals. Google's finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, also said the company expected a \"significant\" increase in that number for 2026 and promised we'd hear more on Google's Q4 call this week.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Ciolli has observed this earnings season, investors are more willing to forgive big capital spending on AI as long as fundamentals remain chugging along.\n\nThat leads to the question of how Google's search advertising business, its core engine, is doing. Are OpenAI and other AI rivals chipping away at its dominance, or is Alphabet's money-printing machine whirring as proudly as ever?\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein appeared optimistic in a note this week, writing that they expect Google to have seen an increase in query volume in Q4.\n\n\"For Tinuiti's advertisers, Google's US paid click growth was the highest it has been since early 2021,\" Bernstein analysts wrote, referring to the US marketing agency.\n\nGoogle's cloud business has also become top billing, as it furiously competes with Amazon and Microsoft to build infrastructure and win crucial AI deals. In Q3, Google said the number of new cloud customers increased by about 34% year over year.\n\nBernstein analysts predicted big business for cloud off the back of AI sales, its big Anthropic deal, and the ramp-up of its AI chip business, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\n\"We also note that the new deal between Anthropic and Google for 'tens of billions of dollars' worth of compute represents upside to Google Cloud growth, regardless of whether the money flows through Cloud deals or outright TPU sales,\" they wrote.\n\nSpeaking of deals, this marks the first earnings report since Google and Apple announced that the iPhone giant will use Google's Gemini AI models for its revamped Siri assistant.\n\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions there. How much does Google get out of the deal? Can Google use query data to train Gemini? Will Apple use Google's data centers and TPU chips?\n\nHopefully, we'll get a clearer picture of the inner workings of that deal on Wednesday's earnings call.",

    "fullText": "Some iOS users are getting an extra layer of privacy when it comes to how their location data is shared. Limit Precise Location is a new setting that prevents some Apple devices from broadcasting specific locations to cell carriers.\n\nPrecise location sharing is useful, even essential, in some cases, such as when you're navigating with your maps app. But you may not want to constantly be sending your exact address to your phone provider, where it could be used for malicious purposes. If you enable Limit Precise Location, your iOS device will share your general area instead.\n\nAs TechCrunch points out, precise location sharing introduces a whole host of privacy and security risks. Cell carriers have been targeted by hackers, compromising sensitive customer data. Surveillance vendors and law enforcement agencies may also use location information broadcast via cellular networks for the purposes of real-time and ongoing tracking.\n\nUsers already have the option to disable precise location sharing at the app level on both iOS and Android for apps that don't need GPS coordinates to function—which is most of them. This allows you to prevent companies from receiving (and selling) your exact location data when a general location is sufficient. Limit Precise Location won't change these app-specific settings.\n\nFor now, the feature is available only on select Apple models—the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, and iPad Pro (M5) Wi-Fi + Cellular—running iOS 26.3 with a limited number of global carriers:\n\nApple says that even with this setting enabled, emergency responders will still be able to pinpoint exact location during an emergency call.\n\nIf you have a supported device with a partner carrier, go to Settings > Cellular and tap Cellular Data Options (you may need to select the specific line under SIMs if you have more than one).

    "title": "Everything We Know About Apple's Rumored Folding iPhone (and iPad)",
    "description": "Apple foldables are back in the rumor cycle.",
    "fullText": "Now that Apple has finally brought OLED to the iPad in the form of the most recent iPad Pro, its next goal seems to be foldables. The big news on the horizon is the foldable iPhone, which The Information first reported on way back in 2024, saying the company hopes to have a foldable iPhone on the market in 2026. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the iPhone maker is also working towards releasing a foldable iPad, originally rumored to be coming by 2028. Since those reports, others have come forward with supposed design leaks and potential release dates, and now we've got a pretty good idea of what Apple's first foldable devices might look like.\n\nWay back when the iPhone Fold (or whatever Apple will call it) was first being discussed, the Wall Street Journal said it’ll have a bigger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Since then, others had speculated that it might look like two iPhone Airs side-by-side. But now, we've got a much better idea about the specifics, including a price.\n\nIn a new post on Chinese social media site Weibo today, leaker Instant Digital laid out several key details about the iPhone Fold's design. Previously, Instant Digital had leaked details about the iPhone 17, which all turned out to be correct. It's unclear what these leaks' sources are, but as far as rumors go, Instant Digital has a decent track record.\n\nVia a machine translation, the post says that the iPhone Fold will feature an \"elegant internal stacking structure\" and will be thin enough to \"shock the industry.\" More concretely, the post also said that all buttons are being moved to the right side of the phone, as that's where the phone's motherboard will be. That means the volume buttons would be on the top-right of the device, while the camera and power buttons will be on the right side of the device. If that sounds cramped to you, it's worth noting that Samsung's Galaxy Fold Z 7 also only has buttons on the right side of the device.\n\nSpeaking of Samsung's Galaxy phones, people who dislike the iPhone's large Dynamic Island should also be happy, as the leaks say the selfie camera is changing to a small pinhole design more akin to what you'd find on Android.\n\nAs for how the phone will actually function, internal specs are still a bit up in the air, although yet another leaker named Fixed Focus Digital (no relation) alleged that the iPhone Fold will have a 5,500 mAh battery, which matches a previous rumor from last fall. That's a bit larger than any iPhone so far, and if the rumor pans out, shows that Apple will use the phone's extra internal space well.\n\nAll of this is, of course, in service of a bigger screen, which we can also nail down a bit now. The most recent leaks, coming from South Korean publication The Elec, say that the iPhone Fold's outer display will be 5.38 inches and the inner display will be 7.58 inches. That makes the internal screen just a little over half-inch larger than the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max display, although maybe the enhanced portability of folding part of that screen away will help supplement it a bit. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's screen is 8 inches.\n\nIn its report, The Elec also expressed concern that Apple might miss its 2026 release target. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo split the difference, saying that the device is likely to be announced in 2026, but that \"smooth shipments\" may not come until 2027.\n\nRegardless, when the phone does come, it's expect to cost between $2,100 and $2,500, going by another leak from Instant Digital.\n\nAll of this helps us have a much better idea about what to expect, but there's still plenty of time for changes to be made. For instance, a 2026 release would see the phone come out during an ongoing RAM crisis that could raise prices, although Kuo recently said that, at least for the iPhone 18 series, Apple plans to eat any extra costs rather than pass them on to the consumer.\n\nEven if it gets delayed to next year, the iPhone Fold's release seems imminent. Much less certain is a potential successor, a clamshell iPhone Flip.\n\nIn his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said that Apple Labs is also now considering a smaller foldable device akin to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr lines, which are essentially standard, candy bar-shaped phones that can fold once vertically to store away like makeup compacts.\n\n\"The product is far from guaranteed to reach the market,\" writes the reporter, citing unnamed sources inside Apple. But Gurman says \"Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand\" and that \"customers will want additional shapes and sizes.\"\n\nThis is our first time hearing that Apple is interested in additional foldable phones beyond one that opens horizontally like a book. On that note, Gurman also speculated that Apple might also make a larger foldable phone in the future, with a screen closer in size to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. Although, unlike with the flip phone, this appears to simply be a prediction.\n\nFinally, speaking of larger foldable devices, Gurman has some bad news for iPad fans. While the reporter had previously covered a folding iPad with a rumored 18.8-inch display, following up on predictions from market research firm Omdia, it now seems to be behind schedule.\n\nEarlier, Gurman had said the new iPad would be like “two iPad Pros side-by-side” and wouldn't feature an external screen. While the expected design hasn't changed, it seems Apple's now run into some manufacturing issues. Now, instead of being projected for 2028, the foldable iPad seems more likely to come out in 2029.\n\nGurman says that's because of \"engineering challenges\" with the device's weight and display technology, so at least skeptics can breathe a sigh of relief that it isn't due to supply chain issues. As such, pricing is likely to remain unaffected. Granted, the expected price is still likely to be on the high end—Gurman says you'll likely have to pay around $3,000 for the device.",

    "description": "India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers in certain areas for five years ​without any tax risk.\n\nApple has been growing in India in recent years as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research ‌says iPhone's share of the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share ‌has quadrupled to 25% since 2022.\n\nWhat is Apple's current market position in India?\n\nWhat tax changes did India make for Apple?\n\nWhy was Apple concerned about India's tax laws?\n\nHow will this benefit Apple's manufacturing strategy?\n\nApple had been lobbying India's government to modify its income tax laws to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of the high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers.\n\nIn India, unlike China, Apple was concerned that if it paid for machines for its contract manufacturers, Indian law could consider that a so-called \"business connection\" and impose taxes on its iPhone sales profits. ⁠That had forced its contract manufacturers Foxconn and ‌Tata to themselves spend billions of dollars on machines.\n\nIndia on Sunday said that \"to promote manufacturing of electronic goods for a contract manufacturer\", it is making certain law changes to ensure that mere ownership of ‍machines by a foreign company does not lead to taxes on it.\n\nThe decision was made public as part of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2026-27 annual budget, presented on Sunday.\n\nThe move could prompt Apple and other companies to invest rapidly in the electronics manufacturing space by taking over initial ​expenses for pricey machines, reducing the initial cost burden on contract manufacturers they partner with.\n\n\"We are saying that if you bring ‌your machine, and that machine is used by a local manufacturer to produce something, we will ... exempt you for 5 years. We are giving them certainty,\" Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget press conference.\n\nFASTER SCALE-UP AND GREATER CONFIDENCE\n\nSmartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda for economic growth.\n\nThe rule change will apply until the 2030-31 tax year and only to factories set up in so-called customs-bonded areas - which are technically considered being outside India’s customs border. If devices are sold within India from ⁠such factories, they will attract import taxes, making such facilities attractive only ​for exports.\n\n\"Any income arising on account of providing capital goods, equipment or tooling ​to a contract manufacturer, being a company resident in India, is eligible for exemption,\" the Indian government said in one of its explanatory budget documents.",

    "title": "The 'father of the iPod' says Apple should bring back a 'nostalgic version' of the music device",
    "description": "The \"father of the iPod,\" Tony Fadell, said the market is ripe for a new take on one of Apple's most famous devices.",
    "fullText": "Forget 2016, it's time to make sound like 2001 again.\n\nTony Fadell, creator of the iPod, said it is time for Apple to relaunch the device that changed the Cupertino-based tech giant and music forever.\n\n\"I think there are smarter ways of making an AirPod that has an iPod in it. So, I think they need to bring back the iPod,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the tech journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell, widely known as \"the father of the iPod,\" said there are two reasons to bring back the device that is synonymous with his legacy.\n\nFirst, to cash in on the broader nostalgia around the music device, which ended in 2019 with the release of the revamped, 7th-generation iPod Touch. The original iPod, which could hold just 1,000 songs, shared much \n\n\"So, iPod from the nostalgic point of view for all those people who's like, 'Oh, I remember the iPod,' but they don't want distractions anymore,\" Fadell said.\n\nSecond, a modern iPod would also tap into a market of music listeners who want a more \"pure\" experience, listening to music without all the extra stuff that comes with listening to music on a smartphone. After all, dumb phones are becoming increasingly popular as people try to simplify their relationship with tech.\n\nOnline, there are still active communities that seek to mod the now-retro iPods to fit more modern needs, including an entire subreddit devoted to the cause.\n\nPressed on what form a new iPod would take, Fadell said he wouldn't give away all of his ideas. Fadell has been mentioned in some corners as a potential replacement for CEO Tim Cook, who has been the subject of retirement speculation. (Cook, who is 64, has said he will not retire in a \"traditional\" way.) Apple exec John Ternus, the iPhone company's senior vice president of hardware engineering, is widely reported to be the top contender to replace Cook.\n\n\"Apple will make the right decision when they need to, about who the next CEO is. I love the company. It's been in my blood since 1980, '81, when I had my first Apple II,\" Fadell said. \"If anyone calls from the board, or Tim called, whatever, I'll be happy to pick up the phone and that's it. I'll help 'em any way they think they would like to be helped.\"\n\nFadell pointed to how Sony — which sells a $3,699 collector's edition of a Walkman — recently announced its first new turntables in years, seeking to capitalize on the growing number of vinyl listeners. Sony also sold off control of its TV line to TCL.\n\n\"They kill the TVs, and they bring back turntables,\" Fadell said. \"You tell me.\"",

    "fullText": "Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is well known for having numerous sources inside of Apple, and in a new interview he shared some interesting comments about the company’s reliance on Anthropic.\n\nApple recently announced an AI partnership with Google. But reporting indicates the company initially pursued deals with other companies, including Anthropic.\n\nBased on new comments from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, it’s easy to see why.\n\nGurman, speaking on TBPN, said the following:\n\nApple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple is doing internally in terms of product development, a lot of their internal tools…They have custom versions of Claude running on their own servers internally.\n\nBloomberg's @markgurman says that even though Apple partnered with Google Gemini for Siri, they actually run their business on Anthropic.\n\n\"Apple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple's doing internally in terms of product development and… pic.twitter.com/NpW0Pyj03J\n\nIn the full clip, Gurman mentions how Apple initially pursued an AI deal with Anthropic before the Google partnership came together.\n\nThe deal apparently fell apart because Anthropic wanted several billion dollars per year, and even a doubling of fees over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s deal with Google is reportedly costing just one billion annually. Initially though, uncertainty around Apple and Google’s existing Safari search deal led to prioritizing Anthropic and OpenAI as potential partners.\n\nWhat do you make of Gurman’s comments about Apple’s reliance on Anthropic’s tech?

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "Big news for runners with an Apple Watch: You can now follow Strava routes directly from your wrist. Route navigation on Strava-compatible watches isn't exactly new technology—it's just been inexplicably absent from Apple's platform until now. In a Reddit post from Strava's product team, the news was welcomed by runners, cyclists, and hikers who've long wondered why their Apple Watch couldn't do what Garmin and Coros devices have offered for years.\n\nThe core update here is users can now view maps directly on their Apple Watch during activities, seeing both where they're headed and how to backtrack if they take a wrong turn. For subscribers, saved Routes work hands-free and function offline, eliminating the need to pull out your phone mid-run or mid-ride to check directions.\n\nTo access routes directly on your watch, press the Route icon while selecting the Sport Type that you’ll record.  Once you’ve selected the saved route you want to follow, the activity will start recording.\n\nTo then access the map while in the middle of recording your activity, simply swipe up on your watch face. Once on the map screen, you will be able to follow your live location and, if added, your saved route. To zoom or pan the map, tap the watch face to unlock interactive mode. If you want to turn back to your Stat screen, tap the back icon or use the watch scroll button.\n\nAlongside route navigation, Strava added two more training features:\n\nCustom Laps let you mark intervals with a single tap, useful for tempo runs, hill repeats, or comparing efforts against your previous performances.\n\nLive Segments provide real-time feedback when you hit a tracked segment. Subscribers can see whether they're ahead or behind their personal record as it happens, while all users get live progress updates.\n\nAs always, you can also turn to route suggestions that draw from Strava's massive activity database full of actual paths that real users have tested and preferred.\n\nFor Apple Watch users who've grown accustomed to working around Strava's limitations, this update rocks. Less phone checking means more attention on the road, trail, or effort itself.\n\nMaybe it's taken longer than it should have, but Apple Watch users are finally caught up. Whether that's enough to satisfy those who've already migrated to other platforms remains to be seen, but for the loyal holdouts, it's about time.",

    "description": "UpScrolled is a social media app that launched in 2025. It's now the No. 2 app on Apple's App Store as TikTok deals with glitches.",
    "fullText": "What's January without a TikTok panic?\n\nLast January, TikTok briefly went dark in the US amid a legal fight. This year, TikTok users were treated to days of app glitches caused by an outage at an Oracle data center, and a transition to a new joint-venture ownership structure in the US.\n\nUpstart rivals have benefited from TikTok users — particularly those concerned about TikTok's new owners' ties to the Trump administration — seeking alternatives. The biggest winner appears to be UpScrolled, which hit No. 2 among free apps in Apple's App Store on Wednesday.\n\nUpScrolled launched last year and was founded by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist who previously worked at tech giants such as IBM and Oracle, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"UpScrolled is a social media platform designed to empower users worldwide — a space to freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,\" the platform's website says. \"We built it because people are asking for more transparency, authenticity, and trust in the platforms they use every day.\"\n\nAccording to estimates from the marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, as of Tuesday, UpScrolled had been downloaded about 400,000 times in the US and 700,000 globally since launching in June 2025. The app saw a surge in downloads beginning January 22, and Sensor Tower estimated that, as of Tuesday, 85% of UpScrolled's downloads in the US had occurred between January 21 and 27.\n\nAs of Wednesday, UpScrolled was No. 1 in the \"social networking\" category in Apple's App Store, surpassing Meta's Threads, WhatsApp, and TikTok. It was the No. 6 free social app on Google Play for Android users, where TikTok (and TikTok Lite) reign.\n\nUpScrolled feels like a combination of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nThere's a feed of accounts you follow, carousel posts, vertical short-form video, stories, and a discovery page with trending topics and hashtags.\n\nOne of the app's selling points for new users is its stance on content censorship: \"No shadowbans, no hidden throttling, no pay-to-play favoritism — ever,\" UpScrolled says on its website.\n\n\"UpScrolled is committed to protecting freedom of expression — but with that freedom comes responsibility,\" UpScrolled's FAQ says. \"We only restrict content that violates our community guidelines or broadly accepted legal and ethical standards. This includes content involving illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.\"\n\nOther social networks are also seeing spikes in users.\n\nSensor Tower data showed a recent marginal increase in Reddit and Pinterest downloads.\n\nMeanwhile, newer apps, like Spill, are also seeing an uptick.\n\nSpill was founded by former Twitter employees and launched in 2023. The app told Business Insider that it had seen an influx of signups in recent days. It was the No. 17 app in the social category as of Wednesday.\n\nIt isn't the first time TikTok users have looked for new pastures.\n\nLast year, other Chinese-owned apps, such as Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, gained traction in the US as TikTok faced legal jeopardy.",

    "fullText": "Apple (AAPL) is apparently opting for margin pain instead of sticker shock.\n\nMemory prices continue to spike due to relentless AI data center demand, but Apple’s looking to sidestep raising iPhone prices, even if it means taking a bottom-line hit.\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who’s a veteran in covering Apple’s supply chain for several years, says the tech giant will stick with their approach when it launches the hotly anticipated iPhone 18, at least for now.\n\nThat pivotal decision puts Apple’s supply-chain strength under the scanner as it heads into earnings on Thursday, January 29, 2026 (after the market closes).\n\nHaving covered the memory space extensively over the past few months, it’s crystal clear that suppliers have a ton of leverage for the foreseeable future.\n\nBellwethers in the space, like Micron, are building mammoth fabs to ease supply constraints, but most of those efforts are long-term, pointing to potential trouble over the next couple of years at least.\n\nNaturally, most hardware companies have little choice but to hike prices, but Apple isn’t your average hardware company.\n\nApple can take the hits and is far more insulated than any other hardware company in history, which could potentially become its biggest strength amidst the memory crunch.\n\nAccording to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is looking to take it on the chin with the higher memory costs instead of risking the iPhone pricing boat.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nKuo’s read is that Apple senses an opportunity in one that effectively plays to its scale and tremendous supply-chain muscle.\n\nIn a post on X, Kuo acknowledged that higher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. However, we went on to say that,\n\nKuo boils Apple’s thinking down to three key moves.\n\nAbsorb the pain now: Memory prices are rising at an incredible pace, and Apple is opting for margin pressure instead of consumer backlash.\n\nLockdown supply: Apple’s scale enables it to effectively secure components that others can’t, even as the shortages grow worse.\n\nPlay the long game: Any near-term margin hit will be viewed as temporary, with services revenue likely to backfill over time.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant risk that these pressures aren’t contained, as Kuo notes that iPhone memory prices are still being renegotiated quarterly rather than on a semiannual basis.",

    "fullText": "Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts.\n\nFor most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)\n\nAs noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality.\n\nStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp.\n\nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on.\n\nHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blocked\n\nOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile.\n\nOnly known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.\n\nThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available.",

    "description": "Apple, OpenAI, Meta, and more are all racing toward AI hardware products.",
    "fullText": "Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.\n\nThe product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.\n\nThe Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.\n\nThe wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.\n\nThe report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.\n\nNot long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.\n\nApple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.\n\nJust a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.",

    "title": "These 'Obsolete' iPhones Just Received a New Update",
    "description": "Apple just issued an update for an iPhone that's over 12 years old.",
    "fullText": "Many of us choose to upgrade our smartphones every two or three years, while others pick up the latest model every year. But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.\n\nBut no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks.\n\nApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age.\n\nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.\n\nThese iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.\n\niOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.\n\nIt's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.",

    "title": "Your iPhone Might Not Be Fully Compatible With Apple's New AirTag",
    "description": "If so, you're better off buying a first-gen AirTag.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, Apple released a new AirTag—but you wouldn't know that from looking at it. The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users.\n\nThere are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.\n\nThe main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag.\n\nAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags.\n\nEven if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)\n\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.)\n\nApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags.\n\nThat's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal.",

    "title": "Apple Finally Announced a New AirTag",
    "description": "AirTag Gen 2 is official.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly five years since Apple released the first—and only—AirTag, but that's not necessarily a surprise: These trackers aren't really the kind of product you expect to update every year or two. Unlike an iPhone, which gets new processors, cameras, and other hardware features every year, AirTags just ... track your stuff. The only thing that needs replacing annually are their batteries; otherwise, they do exactly what you expect them to.\n\nThat said, Apple has made changes over the years. In response to initial criticism, the company made it much more difficult for someone to slip one of these AirTags in your bag or car and track you without your knowledge. Plus, there's plenty you can do with the current AirTag that wouldn't make you think you needed an upgraded one. Nonetheless, I suppose the original AirTag wasn't going to be the AirTag for all time. As such, Apple just announced a brand-new AirTag. It likely won't get you out to replace your existing Apple trackers, but these new features will come in handy if you decide to expand your AirTag collection.\n\nApple isn't really calling this new AirTag anything in particular: It's still just AirTag. I'm a bit surprised, since, even if Apple replaces the existing AirTag with this one, they'll have a difficult time distinguishing between the first and second gen models.\n\nBut that's a problem for Apple Store Geniuses, not us. The new AirTag comes with Apple's second-gen Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip. This is the UWB chip Apple uses with the iPhone 17 Line, as well as the iPhone Air, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch Series 11. That new chip, plus the new Bluetooth chip, boosts Precision Finding's range by 50%. Precision Finding uses your iPhone to guide you to your AirTag, using haptics and visual and audio feedback to tell you when you're getting closer or further away. To be clear, the original AirTag also has a UWB chip that is compatible with Precision Finding, but this new UWB chip will make it easier to find an AirTag that isn't as close by.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2, the new AirTag marks the first time you'll be able to use Precision Finding. I'm not sure that's worth the upgrade, since you can always use Precision Finding with your iPhone, but it's certainly a nice perk if you happen to own one of these watches.\n\nPrecision Finding is helpful for finding your AirTag's whereabouts, but it might not help you locate it if it's hiding, like if it's stuck under a cushion. That's what the speaker is for: You can make your AirTag chirp, so you can find it easier when you're within listening range. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original, which should help when you really can't find your AirTag in your couch.\n\nThat's about all the updates Apple added to this newest AirTag—though you wouldn't know it from the press release. Apple sprinkles in existing AirTag features that might make you think they're fresh, but, really, these are just core features of all AirTags, both new and old.\n\nThis AirTag, like all AirTags, works within the Find My network: There's no inherent internet connection to enable tracking. Instead, the AirTag passively connects to any and all internet-connected Apple devices that are also connected to Find My—often, that means iPhones, but it can mean other devices like iPads and Macs. That enables features like Share Item Location, which lets you share your AirTags location with a third-party, like an airline. In that example, the airline can use that info to help find your luggage.\n\nThe new AirTag also carries over the same privacy and security features as the previous model. No data is stored on device, and all Find My communications are end-to-end encrypted. Whether you have this AirTag or the first, Apple can't see your AirTag, or any devices that connected it to the Find My network.\n\nApple also didn't change the price of the second-gen AirTag. One of these trackers runs you $29, while a four pack costs $99—a small savings if you want to buy that many. Unless you really need the newest ones, however, you might want to consider the previous gen, since you can pick up a four-pack for $69.99 on Amazon right now.",

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula defeated her close friend Madison Keys to end her Australian Open title defence and settle a bet involving apple pie with cheddar cheese on top.\n\nIn an all-American encounter, Pegula needed just 78 minutes to complete an impressive 6-3 6-4 victory and set up a quarter-final with compatriot Amanda Anisimova, who defeated China's Xinyu Wang later on Monday.\n\nDefending champion Keys hit 26 winners - 12 more than Pegula - but she was undone by 28 unforced errors on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nPegula not only walked away with bragging rights over her podcast co-host, but she also won a bet that means Keys must sample something which is a Thanksgiving tradition for the Pegula family.\n\n\"In the US we have Thanksgiving and I don't know why, my grandparents are Canadian, but we have this tradition my mum always did,\" the sixth seed said in her on-court interview.\n\n\"Tell me if this is weird or if it's real. They would melt cheddar cheese on their apple pie.\"\n\nSabalenka sets tie-break record to reach last eight\n\nBombs, queuing for food, and dreams of being a tennis pro\n\nKeys had previously insisted she would refuse to eat the delicacy, but she admitted defeat and said she would accept the terms of the wager.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it. I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be but we'll find out I guess,\" Keys said in her post-match news conference.\n\nHad the ninth seed won the fourth-round match and continued her title defence, Keys' side of the bet involved Pegula - whose billionaire parents own NFL side Buffalo Bills - wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey.\n\n\"She wanted me to wear a [Travis] Kelce slash Taylor Swift Chiefs jersey,\" Pegula said. \"Honestly I had a lot of motivation today not to wear that.\"\n\nThe 2024 US Open finalist wrote \"no Chiefs jersey today\" on a courtside camera lens after her victory and the pair were seen chatting and laughing in the locker room straight after the match.\n\nKeys, who beat Sabalenka in last year's final at Melbourne Park, said she was \"still really proud of herself\" despite her exit.\n\n\"Coming back and being defending champion, and dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves - I am really proud of myself for the way I handled it,\" she said.\n\nFourth seed Anisimova awaits Pegula in the quarter-finals after she overpowered Wang 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 to reach her first quarter-final at the Australian Open.\n\nThe 24-year-old has yet to drop a set at Melbourne Park as she bids for a first major title after finishing as runner-up at Wimbledon and the US Open last year.\n\nWith fellow Americans Coco Gauff and Iva Jovic already in the quarter-finals, it is the first time four players from the US have reached the last eight in the women's singles at the Australian Open since 2001.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "It could be ChatGPT's next big competitor.",
    "fullText": "Last week, Apple finally admitted it will need to team up with Google to finally make good on that contextual Siri promise it made two years ago, which would have allowed the virtual assistant to integrate with content like your texts or emails to answer personal questions and take actions for you. Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.\n\nCurrently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.\n\nIn other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\n\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.\n\nWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n\nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.\n\nBut Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.\n\nHowever you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.",

    "fullText": "I’m an old Mac-head at heart, and I’ve been using Macs since the mid 1990s (the first Mac I used was an LC II with System 7.1 installed on it). I don’t tend to genuinely think that the computing experience was better in the olden days — sure, there’s a thing to be said about the simplicity of older software, but most of my fondness for those days is nostalgia.\n\nFor example, I have wonderful memories of finally getting a copy of ClarisWorks and being able to do pixel-based image editing, which sparked a wonderful childhood “career” of tinkering with icons and various other bits and bobs with that and ResEdit. The things you could do before code signing!\n\nHowever, I’m not going to sit here and say with a straight face that ClarisWorks on System 7 in the 1990s was better than using the myriad of tools we have available to us today. It’s nostalgia for a simpler time — both in computing, and in my life.\n\nAn exception to that, however, is Apple’s Aperture. I’m still grumpy that Apple discontinued it back in 2015, and I’m not alone. Start spending time in the online photography sphere and you’ll start to notice a small but undeniable undercurrent of lament of its loss to this day. Find an article about Adobe hiking their subscription prices because they added AI for some reason, and amongst the complaining in the comments you’ll invariably find it: “I miss Aperture.”\n\nA couple of things have happened recently that spurred me to actually write all of this down rather than grumble occasionally on social media:\n\nApple released macOS Tahoe, which has been pretty constantly raked over the coals for poor design and broken interactions from the day it was released (and even before, if we’re honest).\n\nApple very recently announced their Creator Studio subscription service, and I saw this post on Mastodon by @BasicAppleGuy:\n\nWhen I took this screenshot, the first reply to the post was “I miss Aperture. <long digital sigh>”.\n\nSo, I dug out the ‘ol Trashcan Mac Pro I lovingly reviewed here on this very blog over eleven years ago and fired up Aperture to document — at least partially — just why it was so special.\n\nThe Mac Studio is a perfectly cromulent computer, but it just doesn’t have the verve of the classics, you know?\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Aperture, it’s an app for organising, managing, editing, and exporting images. If you’re familiar with Apple’s Photos app, it’s that. But for professionals! Aperture is a complex app — its PDF user manual is over 900 pages long — so to keep this manageable I’ll focus on one particular aspect of it via two short excerpts from said manual.\n\nTwo excerpts that hide an astonishing amount of engineering effort.\n\nLet’s look at our first excerpt:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nThis little sentence extremely succinctly describes how Aperture is different to most other software of its nature — it comes to you. Most software has you go to it.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let’s look at the Photos app. My brain works pretty spatially — I remember where I took a photo more than when. So, I pan around the map in Photos to find the cool photo of my car in the Alps that I want to edit and send to my friend. Here it is:\n\nI click the picture, and the map is gone, replaced with a list of the images at the location I clicked.\n\nI double-click the photo to bring it up bigger.\n\nI click “Edit” in the top right of the window to switch into Photos’ editing mode (as a shortcut, I could’ve pressed the Return key in the image list to open it straight in the editing mode).\n\nI perform my edits, then click “Done” to get back to the fullscreen viewer. Then I click “Back” to get back to the list of images. Then “Back” again, and I’m finally back at my map. Hooray! Oh wait, I forgot to export it…\n\nThis sort of design is common in apps like Photos, and especially in “shoebox” apps1. Every feature is in its own place, and if you want to use that feature you need to pick up your thing (in this case, a photo) and take it over to where the feature is. In this example, the journey from the map to the editor is through a separate list of images, the fullscreen viewer, then finally to the editor.\n\nIn contrast, Aperture comes to you. As a reminder:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nWhen Aperture says this, it really means it. If you can select an image, you can edit it right where you are with that HUD.\n\nAperture’s map (which by some miracle still works eleven years after it was discontinued) doesn’t show the images on the map, but rather underneath it. It’s less pretty, but combines the first two steps of the journey in the Photos example — the map on top, and the images in the visible map area underneath. Clicking a pin refines the selection of images.\n\nAlight, let’s find another photo of my car in the Alps:\n\nA Volvo stuck in the snow is less awesome than the previous photo, but oh well. I need to edit it, so I press H on my keyboard to bring up the adjustments HUD. I’m still exactly where I was, but now I have editing controls. There’s no step three!\n\nThat was incredibly easy, and I didn’t even leave the map! I need to export it now… and, of course, I can do that from right here on the map too.\n\nI’m still exactly where I was, and I can carry on with the next task.\n\n“But Daniel,” I hear you cry, “Who edits photos on a map?”\n\nFine, it’s a contrived example, but one I was able to directly make between Photos and Aperture. Let’s look at something more real-world: Aperture’s book editor. I love making photo books as the years go by, but putting them together can be a long and tedious process.\n\nLet’s imagine it’s 2005, and I have a page in my book full of pictures of my new car for this year’s book. Unfortunately, auto white balance and changing lighting conditions means the car is a different shade of grey in every photo! Disaster!\n\nIt’d be nice to have them consistent with each other on the page, but matching them all together when they might be from all over the photo library is a big pain. Can you imagine doing that in Photos? Click, click, click, click, into the editor. Tweak white balance. Click, click, click, click, back to the book. Nope, still not right. Click, click, click, click…\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nOh, right! H, drag slider, done. Right on the book page.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate quite how revolutionary and smooth this flow is until you had it for multiple years before having it taken away. Nothing on the market — even over a decade later — is this good at meeting you where you are and not interrupting your flow.\n\nEspecially that book example. My Lord. When Aperture was discontinued (well, when it stopped working properly after an OS update or two) I moved over to Adobe Lightroom (now Lightroom Classic) which had separate modules for file management, editing, and books — switching modules was such a slow and clunky processes, I swear nearly threw my computer out the window trying to colour match photos on a book page.\n\nIt’s OK, Daniel, you got rid of Lightroom years ago. It can’t hurt you any more!\n\nTechnically speaking, the edit-anywhere model is an incredibly impressive feature. Managing a lot of images is already difficult2 (especially on the hardware of the time), and for a map, or a book editor… of course you’d have an optimised set of static thumbnails.\n\nOr, y’know, a full RAW image editing context ready-to-go for anything you might want to click on.\n\nAperture has a tool called the “loupe”. In real life, a loupe is a little cup with a magnifying glass on the top. It’s what’s on the Preview app’s icon, and you use it to zoom in to physical things on a physical surface (I know, how quaint).\n\nIf you want to quickly check specific compositional details of an image, you can use the Loupe. Aperture provides a software Loupe that lets you magnify portions of an image. The Loupe is particularly useful when you are quickly navigating through images in the Browser and you need to verify that the image is in focus or other details without having to switch to the Viewer or Full Screen view.\n\nIn Aperture, the loupe is a little round zoomy thing you can either drag around to view a zoomed-in portion of the image it’s on top of, or attach to the mouse so you can just point at stuff to zoom in.\n\nNote: I’ve dimmed the main Aperture window slightly in the following screenshots to make the loupe clearer.\n\nFun fact: Even when attached to the mouse, the loupe is a separate window just like the other HUDs — which means you can take a screenshot of it independently. Neat!\n\nIt’d be easy to think this is just a screen zoom, or at least a window into a big thumbnail that’s being downsampled a bit for the main viewer. But, since the loupe is attached to the mouse, we can just start pointing at stuff to see what happens.\n\nThere’s no way you’d keep a full-resolution image in memory for every thumbnail on screen, so this is another extremely impressive technical feat. Remember, this is over a decade ago, and Aperture’s system requirements were a Mac with 2GB of RAM. Keeping a whole 20 megapixel image in memory will consume somewhere in the region of 90-120MB3 once you’re starting to display it.\n\nHmm… now that I think about it, the manual doesn’t say where the loupe works and doesn’t, and since we’re not limited to selecting images like with the other HUD…\n\nOnce again, it’s hard to overstate how bonkers this is on a technical level. That’s a list of thumbnails of book pages, there so you can identify which page you want to edit. That thumbnail-within-a-thumbanail — on a Retina display! — is 68x47 pixels. 0.003 megapixels.\n\nFrom a software development perspective, it would be insane to have those pages be anything but static thumbnail images. But hey, would you want to be the person that made the manual say that the loupe works everywhere except in the book editor’s page list?\n\nThese days, technological marvels in computing — if you’ll forgive a gross generalisation — tend to be very flashy. Liquid Glass is a great example of that — it’s very impressive what can be done with the engineering talent and computing power we have available to us today, and the effect is cool. However, my browser’s UI refracting the webpage I’m reading as it scrolls by doesn’t really do anything except look cool… when it isn’t making things less readable.\n\nNotice how the Liquid Glass refraction effect makes it look — at first glance, at least — like we’ll be making a sharp right after we turn left? Thanks, Liquid Glass!\n\nGenerative AI is another technology that falls into this “flashy” camp, but kinda at the other end of the scale. BEHOLD THE AI, FOR IT IS PRODUCING CONTENT. Very useful, very impressive, and is transforming a lot of industries. Just… ignore the wider societal and environmental concerns AS THE AI IS PRODUCING A FUNNY POEM.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss criticisms of these kinds of technologies as the ramblings of an old man, since on average — as I mentioned at the top of this post — the computing experience is orders of magnitude better than it was back then.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point where we as humans need to use our computers as tools to get stuff done, I think we have stagnated over the past few years. When preparing for this post I was excited to fire up Aperture and experience it again, but after less than ten minutes of using it I was getting grumpy — here I am, sitting at a thirteen-year old computer, and I’m flying through my photos faster than I ever do on modern machines. Why is this not possible now?\n\nAperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.\n\nIt’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work?\n\nAnd that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done.\n\nAnd then, it was taken away — with a final, cruel twist of the knife from Apple: “You can use the Photos app as a replacement!” — and everyone was grumpy forever.\n\nAperture’s discontinuation happened at the tail end of my time working at Spotify here in Sweden. As with any corporate job, it had good days and bad days… and after the particularly bad days, I’d rage-fill part of a job application elsewhere. I’d always loved Aperture — as a Mac developer, it was the pinnacle of what was possible on the Mac, and in a field I was passionate about — so this particular application was to work on Aperture at Apple.\n\nI ended up having a couple of interviews with the Aperture team, but as I remember (this was well over a decade ago) the process just… kinda petered out.\n\nA few months later, the official discontinuation announcement happened. I have no idea if I was just not up to the task or if something happened internally during my interview process, but it’s an interesting “What if…” to think about.\n\nAperture: Senior QA (2004-2005) by Chris Hynes \n\nWhile the result was amazing, the development process was… perhaps less so. This is an interesting read about Aperture’s development.\n\nIt’s hard to justify Tahoe icons by Nikita Prokopov \n\nA great look on why (amongst many other reasons) macOS Tahoe is being raked through the coals at the moment.\n\n“Shoebox” apps are apps that contain the content you use with them, as opposed to document-based apps which work with content you manage as a user. It’s an extremely common design nowadays, but less so back then — early pioneers of the shoebox app were iPhoto, iMovie, etc. ↩\n\nI maintain that one of the most technically impressive app on an iPhone is the Photos app’s thumbnail grid – being able to scroll that many images that smoothly is very hard. ↩\n\nMaths: 20 million pixels at 12-16 bits per channel. Doesn’t include overheads of getting from the encoded RAW to a GPU-ready pixel buffer. ↩",

    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "India issues a final warning to Apple in its antitrust case, signaling action after delays over App Store practices.",
    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

I divorced Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star described the experience of her kids leaving the family home as \"a big reckoning,\" which forced her to let go of part of her identity.\n\n\"When you're a parent, it's like you're orienting everything around the child, right? And everything is around their emotional needs, their soccer practice, their dinner, you know. It's so relentless, and it's so intense. And when they go, it's like it forces this major reorientation,\" she said.\n\n\"Marty Supreme,\" which was released in theatres on Christmas Day, is the first movie Paltrow has acted in since 2019. When Fragoso asked if her decision to take the job was linked to her becoming an empty nester, she said, \"very much so.\"\n\n\"I panicked in a sense.

Our technology expert compares the top Apple smartwatches available right now\n\nThe best running watches – tested\n\nThe best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.\n\nEach generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

We make more kernel logging available on iOS and build a log aggregator that combines and aligns system- and network-level log sources from iOS and macOS.\n\nApple's Continuity features make up a big part of their walled garden. From AirDrop and Handoff to AirPlay, they all connect macOS and iOS devices wirelessly. In recent years, security researchers have opened up several of these features showing that the Apple ecosystem is technically compatible with third-party devices.\n\nIn this talk, we present the internal workings of Low-Latency WiFi (LLW) – Apple's link-layer protocol for several real-time Continuity features like Continuity Camera and Sidecar Display. We talk about the concepts behind LLW, how it achieves its low-latency requirement and how we got there in the reverse engineering process.\n\nWe also present the tooling we built to enable more kernel-level tracing and logging on iOS through a reimplementation of cctool from macOS and the source code of trace that was buried deep inside of Apple’s open-source repository system_cmds. We build a log aggregator that combines various kernel- and user-space traces, log messages and pcap files from both iOS and macOS into a single file and finally investigate the network stack on Apple platforms that is implemented in both user- and kernel space. There we find interesting configuration values of LLW that make it the go-to link-layer protocol for Apple's proprietary real-time Continuity applications.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "fullText": "The latest iOS update has hit Apple products, and you can now download it to your iPhone.\n\nSince September, iPhone users have had the chance to update their phones to iOS 26, Apple's software update that ushered in new features like the Liquid Glass design and tools powered by Apple Intelligence. While iOS 26.1 came out in November to mixed reviews, the latest version of the iOS, 26.2, launched last month.\n\nThe latest update is set to enhance certain apps and install security updates on users' devices. If you're looking to update your Apple device, here's what to know about iOS 26.2.\n\niOS 26.2 is the latest Apple software update, released on Dec. 12, 2025. Among the new features mentioned for 26.2 are enhancements to apps Apple Music, Podcasts, and Games. The update brings new ways to customize the look and visibility of the liquid glass design on lock screens and home screens, which creates a see-through, bubble effect, according to the description of the software.\n\nUsers can also now add alarms created in the Clock app into the reminders they create in the Reminders app, according to Apple Insider. In the Podcasts app, users can experience automatically created chapters based on the podcasts' transcripts along with easier ways to navigate the media to find specific mentions or moments.\n\nThe update also includes new security patches and fixes flaws in the last iOS, iOS 26.1. The update does not state what flaws existed in the last iOS, and for the protection Apple customers, the company \"doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and patches or releases are generally available,\" according to Apple.\n\nMore: Like it or not, iOS 26 is here. What to know about the iPhone update.\n\niOS 26.1 went live in November and brought the liquid glass feature to lock screens and home screens. The description also touts live translation features, updates to messages, and enhancements to camera, photos, wallet, CarPlay, and more.\n\nMore on iOS: Apple's iOS 26 update is coming.

If there is an update, tap to download and install it.\n\nOnce you've updated to iOS 26, Apple does not let you downgrade to iOS 18, the USA TODAY Network reported.\n\nSome iPhone users have taken to social media to voice their concerns with the entirety of the iOS 26 update, including calling the liquid glass design \"ugly\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nA Dec. 8 post on Reddit went as far as to warn other users to \"save yourself\" from the latest update.\n\n\"I can't focus. It's disorienting,\" the user wrote, saying that the app \"takes up too much space.\"\n\nDO NOT UPDATE TO IOS 26 I GOT TRICKED BY MY PHONE ITS SO AWFUL\n\n— little gremlin (@frankieplsrelax) December 9, 2025\n\nUsers on X shared similar feelings, with multiple people saying their phones automatically updated to iOS 26 and they now regret the change. One person advised others not to download the update, adding \"Your life will be significantly worse after.\"\n\nSome iPhone users, though, are embracing the bubbly new design. One X user praised the new liquid glass feature, calling its interactions beautiful, while another posted a photo of their screen with the caption \"i love ios 26 lowkey.\"\n\nThese Bubbly interactions are some of the most beautiful aspects of Liquid Glass on iOS 26 ! pic.twitter.com/gypWJLMF0j\n\n— Minimal Nerd (@minimalnerd1) December 10, 2025\n\nParis Barraza contributed to this report.\n\nKate Perez covers national trends and breaking news for USA TODAY.

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "fullText": "Love it or hate it, the Apple ecosystem really does have its perks. Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great.\n\nMicrosoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps.\n\nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board.\n\nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible.\n\nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.\n\nIt's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability.\n\nThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.",

Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

Last week, the company overtook Apple as the second most valuable company behind Nvidia.\n\nSpeculation of a potential deal has been circulating since last year. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was considering paying $1 billion a year to use the Gemini model.\n\n\"This is what the Street has been waiting for with the elephant in the room for Cupertino revolving around its invisible AI strategy,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note on Monday morning, referring to Apple's Cupertino headquarters, \"but we believe this is an incremental positive to both AAPL and GOOGL as a major validation moment for Google as a premier foundation model and for Apple as a stepping stone to accelerate its AI strategy into 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nApple had a head start in the AI assistant race when it launched Siri on its iOS devices in 2011.\n\nHowever, the iPhone maker has lagged behind the competition following the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple has delayed several upgrades to Siri, and Apple shook up its AI division late last year.\n\nFor Google, integration with the leading mobile phone platform in the US is yet another distribution advantage. In addition to being available via a stand-alone app, Gemini powers some Google search features, and it's also the default AI assistant on the company's Pixel smartphones.\n\nThomas Hudson, a VP principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told Business Insider that the deal could \"look counterintuitive\" given Apple and Google compete in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, he pointed to Google's long-running deal to make it the default search engine on Apple's iPhones as an example of how the pair have partnered before. In December, a federal judge ordered Google to limit search and AI app contracts to a one-year term.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple TV User Should Know",
    "description": "You don't actually have to use the remote your Apple TV comes with.",
    "fullText": "Like many Apple devices, your Apple TV works pretty well right out of the box. You plug it in, download your favorite streaming services, and you're off—while much of your data stays put. But while this is a perfectly fine way to watch shows and movies, there are things you can (and should) change to make your Apple TV work even better. Here are 10 such hacks every Apple TV owner should consider using:\n\nThe first time I booted up my Apple TV after updating to tvOS 26, I was greeted with a full-screen profile selector. I soon found out I have to deal with this screen every time I turn on my Apple TV. For a large household that wants separate recommendations and history, that might make sense. But for my TV, choosing my profile instead my wife’s every single time is more of an annoyance.\n\nIf you’re in the same boat, you can disable this screen from Settings > Profile and Accounts. Here, disable the Choose Profile on Wake option. Disabling this feature doesn’t delete the profiles: You can still switch between them using the Power button.\n\nAny time I set up a new Apple TV (or end up resetting mine), this is the setting I change first. For a couple of years, pressing the TV button on the Apple TV remote opens the TV app, instead of taking you back home. To go back to the Home screen, you have to press and hold the TV button instead. Annoying. Thankfully, there is a setting to change this. Go to Settings > Remotes and Devices > TV Button, and switch to Home Screen. Now, pressing the TV button will take you home instead.\n\nIf the Apple TV app is your go-to for TV and movies, there's an easy way to disable autoplaying videos. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Auto-Play Video Previews > Off.\n\nWhile this is the only app that has this setting built into your Apple TV, you can disable autoplaying videos for your other apps too, such as for Netflix and Prime. While each service has its own way of disabling auto-playing videos, you'll likely find similar solutions for each. To change this setting for Netflix and Prime Video, for example, you’ll have to use their respective websites. Open the Netflix website, click on the Profile icon, go to Manage Profiles, choose a profile, and then click Playback Settings. Next, disable Autoplay previews. Then, log out of your account on Apple TV and log in again to see the update. For Prime video, click the Profile Icon, go to Account & Settings > Player and turn the Autoplay video and live events feature Off.\n\nI like the touchpad gesture on the Apple TV. Swiping on it is second nature to me. But whenever my parents use the Apple TV remote they always struggle with it. They prefer the D-pad buttons for moving around, but always send up swiping on the touchpad accidentally. If you have kids or elderly using the Apple TV remote often, you might want to disable the gesture altogether.\n\nGo to Settings > Remote and Devices > Clickpad, and switch to Click Only. Now, the center button will operate as a regular Click or “OK” button, but you won’t be able to use it as a touchpad, which should cut down on some confusion.\n\nIt’s way too easy to lose your Apple TV remote, but, luckily, you don't actually need it. If you have your iPhone nearby, or if you’re wearing your Apple Watch, you can control your Apple TV directly from your Apple devices. On your iPhone, open Control Center, then tap the Apple TV remote button. If you don’t see it, tap and hold the empty part of Control Center to edit the layout. Here, search for and add the Apple TV control. If you’re on the same network, you will see your Apple TV listed here. The first time you connect, you might need to authenticate with a code. Once enabled, you can control playback and navigate the device from your iPhone.\n\nIt’s the same story on the Apple Watch too, but here, it’s a dedicated app. Open the Remote app from your Apple Watch, select the Apple TV around you, and start controlling it.\n\nDid you know you can use a HomePod or any AirPlay-enabled speakers as the default media output for your Apple TV? If you have two wireless speakers, they can even default as a stereo pair. And since HomePods are always paired to your Apple TV, you won’t have to change the sound output every single time you start watching something.\n\nTo set this up on your Apple TV, go to Settings > Video and Audio > Audio Output and then choose the HomePod or the stereo pair as the default output. If you have two HomePods, you’ll first need to set them up a stereo pair from the Home app on your iPhone (follow Apple’s instructions here).\n\nIf you want to watch something at night without waking up your entire family, you should use your AirPods with your Apple TV. As with other Apple devices, AirPods are tightly integrated with Apple TV software. You’ll just need to connect them from Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth first.\n\nThe next time you put them on, you’ll see a suggestion from Apple TV to connect to your AirPods automatically. From here, press and hold the TV/Home button, and they'll connect. You can also use Control Center to quickly switch audio output to AirPods or any Bluetooth audio source. Open Control Center using the Power button, then select the audio output button.\n\nApple TV is like any other device you own. As such, there are times when a tvOS app misbehaves or gets stuck. For me, it’s usually Netflix. Instead of waiting around to fix the mess, you can force-quit an app just like you can on the iPhone. Double-press the TV button to open the app switcher. Then, swipe up on an app to close it. Relaunch the app to fix common issues like audio lag, buffering, and playback issues.\n\nApple TV is a powerful piece of hardware, but if you’re using an older one, sometimes it can start to lag. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Notion and enable the Reduce Motion feature to speed up animations. This way, at least the Apple TV will feel snappier, as you won’t have to wait for elaborate animations.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, your TV shouldn’t notify you about anything. Apple TV, however, notifies you about things like incoming phone and FaceTime calls, Home app updates from your webcam setup, and workout notifications from the Fitness app. To disable them, head to Settings > Notifications, then disable alerts for any and all apps. If you don't want to turn off notifications entirely, you can always press the Power button once to open Control Center and flip on Do Not Disturb.\n\nAdditionally, you can disable call notifications from your iPhone itself. Go to Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices and disable the Apple TV option.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "fullText": "The Apple iPhone is the most popular mobile phone line in the United States and one of the most popular series of devices in the world with an estimated 1.6 billion iPhone users across the globe. Unfortunately, many of those users are now at risk.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Apple has been issuing a warning about a security flaw that data shows would impact around half of those iPhone users, which is around 800 million.\n\nLate last month, Apple began warning users of two critical flaws found in WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The flaws left iPhone users vulnerable an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" which would targeting specific individuals.\n\nApple said that the critical flaw could allow hackers to be able to take control of an iPhone or iPad by using malicious websites on the compromised web browsers and trick the device into executing harmful instructions.\n\nThe flaw left users vulnerable to hackers who could potentially take controll of the iPhone or iPad or run code without your permission, possibly obtaining passwords or payment information.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has already created a patch to correct the vulnerability in its latest software update. However, those that have not installed the software update are vulnurable.\n\nForbes estimates that 50% of all eligible iPhone users have yet to upgrade from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Given that there are more than 1.6 billion iPhone users worldwide, this means that around 800 million devices are still vulnerable. StatCounter has an even more pessimistic view, estimating that just 20% of users have upgraded, which would leave more than 1.2 billion iPhone users vulnerable.\n\nAccording to Apple, the devices most at risk include the iPhone 11 and later, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other vulnerable models include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the iPad (8th generation and later), and the iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to protect yourself from these vulnerabilities is upgrade to the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 26.2.\n\nWhile it was expected that Apple would make a security update for users wanting to stick with iOS 18 for a bit longer, that is no longer the case, as iOS 18.7.3 is not available unless you’re running an iPhone that can’t run iOS 26.\n\n“There’s no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully mitigates this risk,” says Keeper Security’s Darren Guccione, via Forbes.\n\nHe went on to explain that upgrading to the latest version of the software is \"the only effective defense. Once patches are public, the exposure window widens for anyone who delays updating.”\n\nThe good news is that installing the update is easy. In fact, for users with automatic updates enabled, the software should be up to date and the patch should already be installed.\n\nIf you do not have automatic updates enabled, you will need to manually download iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 through their device settings. In this case, users should simply open the \"settings\" app then click \"general\" followed by \"software update.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote that “X’s generation of these harmful and likely illegal depictions of women and children has shown complete disregard for your stores’ distribution terms.” X users have identified several cases where Grok undressed or sexualized apparent minors in the AI-created images.\n\nThe senators point to the app stores’ own policies for why the app should be removed. Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.”",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple HomePod User Should Know",
    "description": "Get more out of Apple's smart speaker.",
    "fullText": "The HomePod is one of the most polarizing Apple devices I've ever owned. When it works, it's awesome, but if anything goes wrong, it can be a bit of a head-scratcher to troubleshoot. That's led to a bit of a mixed reception among Apple fans, but I've been buying HomePods since 2017, and know all the hacks to help make them easier or better to use. Some of these hacks are geared towards trouble-free usage, but others highlight hidden features. Let's dive right in.\n\nIn all my experience with HomePods, I've observed that the product just works a lot better when it's in a place with a strong wifi signal. For a few months, I'd kept the HomePod in a bedroom where my wifi was a bit flaky, and the speaker did not perform well at all. Since it uses either the internet or AirPlay to play sound, it needs a strong wifi signal. If your house has a single router, you may have better luck connecting your HomePod to the 2.4GHz band as opposed to the 5GHz option, which has a shorter range.\n\nYou can check which network your HomePod is connected to by going to the Home app on your iPhone, selecting your HomePod, and going to Accessory Settings. The smart speaker automatically connects to the same network that your iPhone or iPad is connected to. You can switch the wifi network on your iOS device to change the connected wifi on the HomePod.\n\nSince we're talking about increasing the reliability of your HomePod, you'll find that pairing it with your Apple TV will make it far less flaky. This is not to say that you should go out and buy an Apple TV just to make your HomePod work better, but if you do have the streaming device, you should consider pairing it with your HomePod for the best results.\n\nI've used my HomePods with my iPhone, Mac, iPad, and even my Apple Watch, and I can tell you that the experience is just not the same as when using the speaker with an Apple TV. For starters, the Apple TV can use a HomePod as a default output, which means that you don't have to fiddle with software buttons or use Siri to operate the speaker. You just switch on your Apple TV, play anything you like, and the HomePod will just work. That may sound like a minor benefit, but it's really not. I don't have many good things to say about the HomePod's software and reliability, and it's only been 100% solid when I've used it with an Apple TV.\n\nI don't usually tell people to spend more money to make the most of a product, but in the case of Apple's HomePods, two speakers are a lot better than just one. If you have the bigger HomePod, you'll probably be fine with just one of those, but that's not true for those of us who have opted for a HomePod mini. Using two HomePod minis in a stereo pair is a much better experience, taking what can be underwhelming audio and letting it play with the big boys. And that goes double if you followed through on that last hack. If you have an Apple TV, you're going to be really impressed when connecting it to two HomePods in a stereo pair. It makes watching movies so much better.\n\nHDMI ARC is one of the least-known features of the HomePod, but once you try it, there's no going back. In a nutshell, it lets you use the HomePod as a speaker for your PS5, Xbox, or any other device connected to your TV. It requires a pretty specific combination of hardware to work, and even after having that in place, you may have to troubleshoot it a bit to get it working correctly. This is because there are at least four different devices made by different manufacturers involved here. Sometimes you might need to manually enable ARC, eARC, or HDMI-CEC in your TV's settings, which usually does the trick.\n\nThis Apple Support page highlights everything you need to make this feature work, which boils down to having an Apple TV 4K (second-gen or newer), a HomePod or a HomePod mini, and a TV that supports HDMI ARC or eARC (usually, TV manufacturers label the HDMI ports to indicate support for these technologies). You'll have to enable this feature on your Apple TV first, and once you do that, the HomePod should play sound from other devices connected to your TV. Note that you need to add the Apple TV and the HomePod to the same \"room\" in the Home app on your iPhone to make this feature work.\n\nThe good news is that this setup is a one-time headache, and once it's done, it works without much trouble.\n\nIf you have more than one HomePod of the same type, you can and should try using them for multi-room audio. Three HomePods (or HomePod Minis) are good enough to cover an apartment of around 1000 sqft, and you can use them to have music playing in every room as you go about your day. If you have a Mac, you could also get the excellent SoundSource app to test how much you like multi-room audio without having to buy multiple HomePods first, too. SoundSource lets you send audio to multiple devices at once, which means that you can play the same audio file on generic Bluetooth speakers, HomePods, AirPods, and any other audio devices connected to your Mac, at the same time.\n\nYou can use this to get a feel for how multi-room audio sounds, and if you like the experience, you can use multiple HomePods to have the same experience with minimal latency.\n\nYou can use your HomePod to send voice messages to other people in your house. For instance, you can send the following command to Siri: \"Intercom, it's time for dinner.\" This will send your dinner reminder message to all HomePods in the house. Others can use Siri to reply to you as well, making it an effective alternative to sending texts.\n\nYou can access the intercom function by opening the Home app on your iPhone, holding down the HomePod icon, and selecting Accessory Settings > Intercom. It also works with Siri on your iPhone, so you can send an intercom message to a HomePod even when it's not nearby.\n\nApple's HomeKit smart home platform may not be as popular as its competition, but there are some good HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories out there. If you find the right products, you can use the HomePod to control your entire house. This includes lights, doors, cameras, and many other types of smart home gadgets. Of course, all of these features are heavily dependent on Siri, which means that you'll occasionally have to repeat your commands or deal with the wrong gadget being switched on or off.\n\nAlthough Siri can be frustrating to deal with, HomeKit is the best option for people who want a privacy-focused smart home platform. Apple tries its best to minimize data sent to external servers and encrypts security footage, which is different from the approach many competing platforms have chosen.\n\nIn my experience, it's worth it to take some time to figure out the best place to put your HomePod, particularly for the best stereo output. Apple recommends placing your HomePod up to 10 inches away from a wall, but in my experience, it works best if it's about 6-10 inches from walls. For the best stereo experience, you should place your two HomePods on either side of your TV, not more than 4 feet from each other.\n\nIf you have expensive wood furniture, be sure to check if it's safe to place the HomePod on those surfaces. Sometimes, HomePods can leave a mark on wooden surfaces, so you can consider using a cork trivet to protect the surface.\n\nIf you've previously enabled sharing analytics data with Apple, your HomePod could be sending audio of your Siri interactions to Apple's servers. You should review this and disable the feature if you don't want to share this data. Open the Home app on your iPhone, hold the HomePod icon, and go to Accessory Settings. Now, go to Analytics & Improvements and disable all options on this page. On the Accessory Settings page, you can also go to Siri History and select Delete Siri History to clear out previously stored data.\n\nThe HomePod also supports automation routines, and you can use these to do lots of fun things. For about a year, I'd set up my HomePod to play calming music in the mornings and some jazz at sunset. You can set these up in Apple's Shortcuts app. Go to the Automation section, tap the + button, and select Create Home Automation. This is where you can set up your favorite automation routines. The HomePod supports executing actions when you reach or leave your home, at a specific time of the day, when accessories are connected, or when a sensor detects something (eg: motion).",

    "title": "8BitDo Reveals Ultimate 3E Modular Controller For Xbox And PC",
    "description": "8BitDo unveiled the next generation of its flagship Ultimate controller series at CES 2026--and it now makes sense why the manufacturer hasn't released an Xbox version of the Ultimate 2. Officially licensed by Xbox, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E is a wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own Elite Series 2 and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Scuf Valor Pro, and GameSir G7 Pro.",

    "description": "Apple needs big news in 2026, and it's expected to deliver launches like a foldable iPhone.",
    "fullText": "Apple is famously tight-lipped about what it's working on. However, occasionally the tech giant gives hints about what's coming.\n\nIt's pointed to big changes coming to its voice assistant Siri, for example.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Apple, which is expected to release a foldable iPhone and upgrade its AI, Apple Intelligence, a technology that CEO Tim Cook has struggled to establish as a household name.\n\n\"Many will point to AI as Cook's Achilles' heel — and that critique is not misplaced, though not for lack of early ambition. The shortfall lies in execution,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider.\n\nThe company typically makes big product announcements in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference and in the fall, when it tends to debut a new iPhone generation. It also sprinkles in other product launches throughout the year, such as new iPads or Mac computers.\n\nHere's what tech analysts, insiders, and Apple itself have said to expect from the tech giant in 2026.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple's Services business, which encompasses its subscription-based offerings, has experienced steady growth across several earnings periods. It makes sense that this is an area where Apple would want to continue innovating.\n\nOn January 2, the tech giant released an update to its Apple Fitness+ service, which it teased heading into the new year.\n\nThe features include new workout programs, an Artist Spotlight that features exercise playlists dedicated to specific artists, and new additions to its Time to Walk program, which pairs storytelling with music for people to listen to while walking.\n\nApple first teased an updated AI-powered Siri at WWDC 2024 in a now-deleted clip where actor Bella Ramsey asks Siri to remind them about the name of someone they'd had dinner with in the past. In the clip, Siri was able to recall the name based on the prior context of texts and the calendar.\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence came out in fall 2024, that version of Siri was missing. In March 2025, Apple made the rare move of delaying its launch, saying it'll be released \"in the coming year.\"\n\nApple confirmed to Tom's Guide in June 2025 that the new Siri would come in 2026.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, known for his Apple predictions and supply-chain sourcing, said in a note in 2025 that he expects Apple to introduce the first foldable iPhone in 2026 with a retail price of over $2,000.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a similar timeline and price point for the launch of a foldable iPhone.\n\nCompetitors like Samsung and Chinese phone maker Huawei have been on the foldable phones trend for years, so Apple won't be the first to innovate its product lineup this way.\n\nAs it stands, foldable phones have a relatively \"small base\" in the smartphone market, Chatterjee told Business Insider in August 2025. Apple, however, has the market share to make the form factor mainstream among smartphone owners.\n\n\"Apple will, like it has done before in the smartwatch business, where Samsung moved first, be a catalyst for growth in the category,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nApple analyst Kuo published a note in June 2025 on a more affordable 13-inch MacBook, which Bloomberg reported could cost less than the $999 MacBook Air, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt would be the first MacBook to run on a chip built for an iPhone, Kuo said. Kuo predicted mass production would begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026.",
