    "title": "Warren Buffett Says Buy This Vanguard Index Fund -- It Could Turn $400 Per Month Into $835,000 With Help From Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft",
    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "title": "These Two New iPhone Features Are Coming to iOS 26.3",
    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "fullText": "However, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nHowever, Apple can collect ‘appropriate’ fees from external App Store links, says court.\n\nApple has lost its appeal of a massive district court ruling in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Epic Games.\n\nThat April ruling from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Apple “willingly” failed to comply with a 2021 order allowing mobile app developers to link to payment options outside of Apple’s, and she barred Apple from charging a commission on in-app purchases using external payment links, among other restrictions. In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "description": "Sleep Score should feel a bit more accurate.",
    "fullText": "watchOS 26 wasn't a huge update, but it did introduce some new features. You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:\n\nwatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.\n\nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you.\n\nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nYou'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n\nIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n\nFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice.\n\nApple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone.",

    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",

    "description": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the...",
    "fullText": "Authoritarian governments don’t like their citizens being able to have private conversations using end-to-end encrypted messaging apps. This is the reason Russia has just banned FaceTime, but it was surprising iMessage had escaped a ban.\n\nA potential reason for this has now been discovered: Apple may have accidentally made it almost impossible for a government to ban its end-to-end encrypted text messaging app …\n\nRussia last week blocked the use of FaceTime within the country, naturally using terrorism as the excuse.\n\nJustifying its decision, the communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in an emailed statement: “According to law enforcement agencies, FaceTime is being used to organise and carry out terrorist attacks in the country, recruit perpetrators, and commit fraud and other crimes against Russian citizens.” The watchdog did not cite evidence in support of the allegations.\n\nFaceTime uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), so audio and video calls cannot be intercepted by the state. However, some were curious why Russia hadn’t done the same with iMessage, which is similarly protected by E2EE.\n\nOne potential explanation offered is that iMessage usage within the country is extremely low, with most people preferring other messaging apps. Now, however, another possible explanation has surfaced.\n\nWhen Apple commenter John Gruber wondered aloud about this, Mastodon user Magebarf had an idea.\n\nIsn’t it still that the iMessage traffic is merged on the same endpoint as the push notifications? So, if taking out iMessage all remote push notifications to iPhone would immediately cease to work.\n\nThey suggested this was a deliberate decision by Apple, but the aim was to ensure carriers, rather than repressive governments, couldn’t block iMessage. Carriers might otherwise have been tempted to do so as the service reduced demand for SMS, which attracted per-message charges at the time.\n\nThis is how they shoehorned in iMessage under the nose of all phone operators, who already had been using the push notifications as one of the the major reasons for their customers to get a iPhone, and now they couldn’t block the iMessage traffic.\n\nAs evidence for this, they noted that choosing the messaging-only tier on in-flight Wi-Fi services means you continue to get push notifications for other apps you can’t actually access.\n\nSince FaceTime also relies on the Apple Push Notification service (APNs), it’s not 100% clear whether this is indeed the explanation. There are also other methods a government could use to block iMessage, such as blocking access to Identity Services, though this may be tougher to implement across an entire country.\n\nHowever, it does seem to be at least plausible and if accurate would explain an otherwise surprising decision.\n\nOf course, assuming it was an accidental side benefit of a policy targeting carriers is also speculation. It may well be that Apple had in mind also protecting against repressive governments, although in that case you might have expected it to similarly protect FaceTime.\n\nBenjamin Mayo contributed to this report\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "fullText": "Apple and Google want to simplify data transfer between their iOS and Android platforms, support more data formats, and enable wireless transfer. The EU welcomes this step, stating: The Digital Markets Act is showing its effect.\n\nThe EU Commission has sent a statement to 9to5Mac. In it, a Commission spokesperson says about Apple and Google's cooperation in this area that it is an \"example of how the Digital Markets Act (DMA) benefits users and developers\".\n\nThe EU further states that this solution allows users to easily transfer data from iPhone to Android and vice versa when setting up a new device. According to the report, the transfer is intended to support \"many types of data\" – including contacts, calendar events, messages, photos, documents, Wi-Fi networks, passwords, and also data from third-party apps. Unlike previous solutions, the optimized method will also be wireless.\n\nAccording to the EU, the more seamless cross-platform data transfer follows the introduction of eSIM transfer by Apple and Google last October. Currently, however, this solution is only supported by a few network operators, but also by some outside the EU.\n\nBoth solutions are the direct result of the DMA, which \"requires effective data portability\" from certain services – including iOS and Android, the EU statement continues. Apple has summarized its work on this project in its DMA compliance reports from March 2024 and March 2025. Furthermore, the solutions are possible through extensive technical work and collaboration between Apple and Google, as well as through intensive discussions with the Commission over the past two years, according to the EU spokesperson.\n\nUnlike numerous features that Apple offers exclusively to its customers in the EU, such as alternative marketplaces, the seamless data transfer between platforms will be provided worldwide. For Apple, the solution is likely to be a win to attract new customers from Google's Android. This could, of course, also happen the other way around, with Google poaching from Apple. For consumers, the new solution means no longer being necessarily trapped in one of the two platform worlds.\n\nIncidentally, Apple will have to open up its iOS and iPadOS even further in the future, so that headphones and smartwatches, for example, work more seamlessly with the operating systems. These requirements are not at all to the company's liking, and it wanted to prevent this. The iPhone maker and Google are also not big fans of the Digital Markets Act: Apple would prefer to abolish the law, Google wishes for a reset, as it causes significant collateral damage in its current form.\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "For reminders you really shouldn't forget.",
    "fullText": "Apple’s various apps and utilities are finally starting to talk to each other, and it’s great news for iPhone users. Last year, Apple added the ability to sync Reminders with Calendar, which added time-based reminders directly into your Calendar view—a feature I now regularly use. Now, with iOS 26.2, Apple is finally integrating Reminders with the Alarms app; you'll be able to set an accompanying alarm for any reminder.\n\nIf, like me, you tend to be forgetful—if you need a reminder for your reminder—this will be a handy feature. The alarm will sound, taking up your entire screen until you dismiss it. And yes, you can snooze it.\n\nTo get started, open the Reminder app, navigate to a task list, and either create a new reminder, or edit it. When you’re adding a date and time, you’ll see a new Urgent toggle. When you enable the Urgent mode, it will turn on an alarm that will go off when the reminder is due. The alarm will trigger even when your iPhone is in silent mode or in a Do Not Disturb Focus mode, so be careful when setting it up.\n\nWhen you enable this for the first time, you’ll get a connection request for integrating Reminders with Alarms. Here, tap Allow. If you don’t see this popup, or if you’ve dismissed it before, go to Settings > Apps > Reminders, and in the \"Allow Reminders to Access\" section, enable the Alarms toggle.\n\nWhen the reminder is due, you’ll see a full-screen reminder interface, with the reminder up top, and an option to slide to stop (using Apple’s new sliding interface for dismissing alarms, which you can disable if you want). You’ll also see a big blue Snooze button. This will snooze the reminder for nine minutes.\n\nWhether you hit the Snooze button or you use the slider to stop the alarm, Apple will add the Reminder to the top of the notifications list, as a Live Activity. You’ll see the reminder, with the snooze duration (if enabled), and the task. To actually complete the task, you’ll have to check it off from the Live Activity or the Reminders app.\n\nUnlike in the new alarm feature, there’s no way to edit the Snooze duration for reminders, or to disable the slider. If you don’t like the Snooze feature or the two-tap approach to completing reminders, you can switch it out for a Complete button instead. Go to Settings > Apps > Reminders and in the \"Urgent Reminders\" section, enable the Complete from Alarm feature. Now, when the alarm goes off, you’ll see two buttons instead: Slide to Stop and Complete. When you tap Complete, the alarm will disappear, and the task will be marked as Complete.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
