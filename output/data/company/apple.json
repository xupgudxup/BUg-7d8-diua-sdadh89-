    "title": "The 'father of the iPod' says Apple should bring back a 'nostalgic version' of the music device",
    "description": "The \"father of the iPod,\" Tony Fadell, said the market is ripe for a new take on one of Apple's most famous devices.",
    "fullText": "Forget 2016, it's time to make sound like 2001 again.\n\nTony Fadell, creator of the iPod, said it is time for Apple to relaunch the device that changed the Cupertino-based tech giant and music forever.\n\n\"I think there are smarter ways of making an AirPod that has an iPod in it. So, I think they need to bring back the iPod,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the tech journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell, widely known as \"the father of the iPod,\" said there are two reasons to bring back the device that is synonymous with his legacy.\n\nFirst, to cash in on the broader nostalgia around the music device, which ended in 2019 with the release of the revamped, 7th-generation iPod Touch. The original iPod, which could hold just 1,000 songs, shared much \n\n\"So, iPod from the nostalgic point of view for all those people who's like, 'Oh, I remember the iPod,' but they don't want distractions anymore,\" Fadell said.\n\nSecond, a modern iPod would also tap into a market of music listeners who want a more \"pure\" experience, listening to music without all the extra stuff that comes with listening to music on a smartphone. After all, dumb phones are becoming increasingly popular as people try to simplify their relationship with tech.\n\nOnline, there are still active communities that seek to mod the now-retro iPods to fit more modern needs, including an entire subreddit devoted to the cause.\n\nPressed on what form a new iPod would take, Fadell said he wouldn't give away all of his ideas. Fadell has been mentioned in some corners as a potential replacement for CEO Tim Cook, who has been the subject of retirement speculation. (Cook, who is 64, has said he will not retire in a \"traditional\" way.) Apple exec John Ternus, the iPhone company's senior vice president of hardware engineering, is widely reported to be the top contender to replace Cook.\n\n\"Apple will make the right decision when they need to, about who the next CEO is. I love the company. It's been in my blood since 1980, '81, when I had my first Apple II,\" Fadell said. \"If anyone calls from the board, or Tim called, whatever, I'll be happy to pick up the phone and that's it. I'll help 'em any way they think they would like to be helped.\"\n\nFadell pointed to how Sony — which sells a $3,699 collector's edition of a Walkman — recently announced its first new turntables in years, seeking to capitalize on the growing number of vinyl listeners. Sony also sold off control of its TV line to TCL.\n\n\"They kill the TVs, and they bring back turntables,\" Fadell said. \"You tell me.\"",

    "fullText": "Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is well known for having numerous sources inside of Apple, and in a new interview he shared some interesting comments about the company’s reliance on Anthropic.\n\nApple recently announced an AI partnership with Google. But reporting indicates the company initially pursued deals with other companies, including Anthropic.\n\nBased on new comments from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, it’s easy to see why.\n\nGurman, speaking on TBPN, said the following:\n\nApple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple is doing internally in terms of product development, a lot of their internal tools…They have custom versions of Claude running on their own servers internally.\n\nBloomberg's @markgurman says that even though Apple partnered with Google Gemini for Siri, they actually run their business on Anthropic.\n\n\"Apple runs on Anthropic at this point. Anthropic is powering a lot of the stuff Apple's doing internally in terms of product development and… pic.twitter.com/NpW0Pyj03J\n\nIn the full clip, Gurman mentions how Apple initially pursued an AI deal with Anthropic before the Google partnership came together.\n\nThe deal apparently fell apart because Anthropic wanted several billion dollars per year, and even a doubling of fees over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple’s deal with Google is reportedly costing just one billion annually. Initially though, uncertainty around Apple and Google’s existing Safari search deal led to prioritizing Anthropic and OpenAI as potential partners.\n\nWhat do you make of Gurman’s comments about Apple’s reliance on Anthropic’s tech? Let us know in the comments.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "Big news for runners with an Apple Watch: You can now follow Strava routes directly from your wrist. Route navigation on Strava-compatible watches isn't exactly new technology—it's just been inexplicably absent from Apple's platform until now. In a Reddit post from Strava's product team, the news was welcomed by runners, cyclists, and hikers who've long wondered why their Apple Watch couldn't do what Garmin and Coros devices have offered for years.\n\nThe core update here is users can now view maps directly on their Apple Watch during activities, seeing both where they're headed and how to backtrack if they take a wrong turn. For subscribers, saved Routes work hands-free and function offline, eliminating the need to pull out your phone mid-run or mid-ride to check directions.\n\nTo access routes directly on your watch, press the Route icon while selecting the Sport Type that you’ll record.  Once you’ve selected the saved route you want to follow, the activity will start recording.\n\nTo then access the map while in the middle of recording your activity, simply swipe up on your watch face. Once on the map screen, you will be able to follow your live location and, if added, your saved route. To zoom or pan the map, tap the watch face to unlock interactive mode. If you want to turn back to your Stat screen, tap the back icon or use the watch scroll button.\n\nAlongside route navigation, Strava added two more training features:\n\nCustom Laps let you mark intervals with a single tap, useful for tempo runs, hill repeats, or comparing efforts against your previous performances.\n\nLive Segments provide real-time feedback when you hit a tracked segment. Subscribers can see whether they're ahead or behind their personal record as it happens, while all users get live progress updates.\n\nAs always, you can also turn to route suggestions that draw from Strava's massive activity database full of actual paths that real users have tested and preferred.\n\nFor Apple Watch users who've grown accustomed to working around Strava's limitations, this update rocks. Less phone checking means more attention on the road, trail, or effort itself.\n\nMaybe it's taken longer than it should have, but Apple Watch users are finally caught up. Whether that's enough to satisfy those who've already migrated to other platforms remains to be seen, but for the loyal holdouts, it's about time.",

    "description": "UpScrolled is a social media app that launched in 2025. It's now the No. 2 app on Apple's App Store as TikTok deals with glitches.",
    "fullText": "What's January without a TikTok panic?\n\nLast January, TikTok briefly went dark in the US amid a legal fight. This year, TikTok users were treated to days of app glitches caused by an outage at an Oracle data center, and a transition to a new joint-venture ownership structure in the US.\n\nUpstart rivals have benefited from TikTok users — particularly those concerned about TikTok's new owners' ties to the Trump administration — seeking alternatives. The biggest winner appears to be UpScrolled, which hit No. 2 among free apps in Apple's App Store on Wednesday.\n\nUpScrolled launched last year and was founded by Issam Hijazi, a Palestinian-Jordanian-Australian technologist who previously worked at tech giants such as IBM and Oracle, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"UpScrolled is a social media platform designed to empower users worldwide — a space to freely express thoughts, share moments, and connect with others,\" the platform's website says. \"We built it because people are asking for more transparency, authenticity, and trust in the platforms they use every day.\"\n\nAccording to estimates from the marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, as of Tuesday, UpScrolled had been downloaded about 400,000 times in the US and 700,000 globally since launching in June 2025. The app saw a surge in downloads beginning January 22, and Sensor Tower estimated that, as of Tuesday, 85% of UpScrolled's downloads in the US had occurred between January 21 and 27.\n\nAs of Wednesday, UpScrolled was No. 1 in the \"social networking\" category in Apple's App Store, surpassing Meta's Threads, WhatsApp, and TikTok. It was the No. 6 free social app on Google Play for Android users, where TikTok (and TikTok Lite) reign.\n\nUpScrolled feels like a combination of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok.\n\nThere's a feed of accounts you follow, carousel posts, vertical short-form video, stories, and a discovery page with trending topics and hashtags.\n\nOne of the app's selling points for new users is its stance on content censorship: \"No shadowbans, no hidden throttling, no pay-to-play favoritism — ever,\" UpScrolled says on its website.\n\n\"UpScrolled is committed to protecting freedom of expression — but with that freedom comes responsibility,\" UpScrolled's FAQ says. \"We only restrict content that violates our community guidelines or broadly accepted legal and ethical standards. This includes content involving illegal activity, hate speech, bullying, harassment, explicit nudity, unlicensed copyrighted material, or anything intended to cause harm.\"\n\nOther social networks are also seeing spikes in users.\n\nSensor Tower data showed a recent marginal increase in Reddit and Pinterest downloads.\n\nMeanwhile, newer apps, like Spill, are also seeing an uptick.\n\nSpill was founded by former Twitter employees and launched in 2023. The app told Business Insider that it had seen an influx of signups in recent days. It was the No. 17 app in the social category as of Wednesday.\n\nIt isn't the first time TikTok users have looked for new pastures.\n\nLast year, other Chinese-owned apps, such as Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, gained traction in the US as TikTok faced legal jeopardy.",

    "fullText": "Apple (AAPL) is apparently opting for margin pain instead of sticker shock.\n\nMemory prices continue to spike due to relentless AI data center demand, but Apple’s looking to sidestep raising iPhone prices, even if it means taking a bottom-line hit.\n\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who’s a veteran in covering Apple’s supply chain for several years, says the tech giant will stick with their approach when it launches the hotly anticipated iPhone 18, at least for now.\n\nThat pivotal decision puts Apple’s supply-chain strength under the scanner as it heads into earnings on Thursday, January 29, 2026 (after the market closes).\n\nHaving covered the memory space extensively over the past few months, it’s crystal clear that suppliers have a ton of leverage for the foreseeable future.\n\nBellwethers in the space, like Micron, are building mammoth fabs to ease supply constraints, but most of those efforts are long-term, pointing to potential trouble over the next couple of years at least.\n\nNaturally, most hardware companies have little choice but to hike prices, but Apple isn’t your average hardware company.\n\nApple can take the hits and is far more insulated than any other hardware company in history, which could potentially become its biggest strength amidst the memory crunch.\n\nAccording to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is looking to take it on the chin with the higher memory costs instead of risking the iPhone pricing boat.\n\nMorgan Stanley sets jaw-dropping Micron price target after event\n\nNvidia’s China chip problem isn’t what most investors think\n\nQuantum Computing makes $110 million move nobody saw coming\n\nMorgan Stanley drops eye-popping Broadcom price target\n\nApple analyst sets bold stock target for 2026\n\nKuo’s read is that Apple senses an opportunity in one that effectively plays to its scale and tremendous supply-chain muscle.\n\nIn a post on X, Kuo acknowledged that higher memory costs will hit iPhone gross margins. However, we went on to say that,\n\nKuo boils Apple’s thinking down to three key moves.\n\nAbsorb the pain now: Memory prices are rising at an incredible pace, and Apple is opting for margin pressure instead of consumer backlash.\n\nLockdown supply: Apple’s scale enables it to effectively secure components that others can’t, even as the shortages grow worse.\n\nPlay the long game: Any near-term margin hit will be viewed as temporary, with services revenue likely to backfill over time.\n\nHowever, there’s a significant risk that these pressures aren’t contained, as Kuo notes that iPhone memory prices are still being renegotiated quarterly rather than on a semiannual basis.",

    "fullText": "Not to be outdone by Apple's \"Lockdown Mode,\" Meta is rolling out new security features for WhatsApp designed to protect high-risk users—journalists, activists, and government officials, for example—from cyber attacks. Strict Account Settings is a \"lockdown-style\" mode that builds on the platform's existing end-to-end encryption, adding stronger privacy features and additional restrictions against unknown contacts.\n\nFor most WhatsApp users, this level of lockdown is overkill. However, people with access to sensitive data that is potentially valuable to threat actors actually have been targeted with spyware campaigns through messaging platforms like WhatsApp, so for users like that, it may be a lifesaver. (In the last year, WhatsApp has also patched multiple zero-day exploits that allowed spyware to proliferate.)\n\nAs noted, the new WhatsApp settings are similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, an OS-level feature that blocks attachments, link previews, and communication from unknown contacts alongside some other settings changes. It also disables wired connections to external devices and a range of web features. Android's Advanced Protection offers similar functionality.\n\nStrict Account Settings automatically enables existing privacy and security settings and adds a host of restrictions to users' communication and visibility on WhatsApp.\n\nTwo-step verification and security notifications, which alert you if a contact's security code changes, are turned on.\n\nHigh volumes of messages from unknown accounts are blocked\n\nOnly your contacts or those added to a pre-established list can see information about you, including your last seen and online, profile photo, about details, and links on your profile.\n\nOnly known contacts or those on your pre-established list can add you to groups.\n\nThese controls can be enabled by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced and toggling on Strict account settings. Settings must be changed on your primary device and cannot be updated on the web. Note that the feature will roll out gradually over the coming weeks, and may not be immediately available.",

    "description": "Apple, OpenAI, Meta, and more are all racing toward AI hardware products.",
    "fullText": "Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.\n\nThe product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.\n\nThe Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.\n\nThe wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.\n\nThe report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.\n\nNot long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.\n\nApple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.\n\nJust a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.",

    "title": "These 'Obsolete' iPhones Just Received a New Update",
    "description": "Apple just issued an update for an iPhone that's over 12 years old.",
    "fullText": "Many of us choose to upgrade our smartphones every two or three years, while others pick up the latest model every year. But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.\n\nBut no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks.\n\nApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age.\n\nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.\n\nThese iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.\n\niOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.\n\nIt's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.",

    "title": "Your iPhone Might Not Be Fully Compatible With Apple's New AirTag",
    "description": "If so, you're better off buying a first-gen AirTag.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, Apple released a new AirTag—but you wouldn't know that from looking at it. The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users.\n\nThere are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.\n\nThe main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag.\n\nAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags.\n\nEven if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)\n\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.)\n\nApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags.\n\nThat's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal.",

    "title": "Apple Finally Announced a New AirTag",
    "description": "AirTag Gen 2 is official.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly five years since Apple released the first—and only—AirTag, but that's not necessarily a surprise: These trackers aren't really the kind of product you expect to update every year or two. Unlike an iPhone, which gets new processors, cameras, and other hardware features every year, AirTags just ... track your stuff. The only thing that needs replacing annually are their batteries; otherwise, they do exactly what you expect them to.\n\nThat said, Apple has made changes over the years. In response to initial criticism, the company made it much more difficult for someone to slip one of these AirTags in your bag or car and track you without your knowledge. Plus, there's plenty you can do with the current AirTag that wouldn't make you think you needed an upgraded one. Nonetheless, I suppose the original AirTag wasn't going to be the AirTag for all time. As such, Apple just announced a brand-new AirTag. It likely won't get you out to replace your existing Apple trackers, but these new features will come in handy if you decide to expand your AirTag collection.\n\nApple isn't really calling this new AirTag anything in particular: It's still just AirTag. I'm a bit surprised, since, even if Apple replaces the existing AirTag with this one, they'll have a difficult time distinguishing between the first and second gen models.\n\nBut that's a problem for Apple Store Geniuses, not us. The new AirTag comes with Apple's second-gen Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip. This is the UWB chip Apple uses with the iPhone 17 Line, as well as the iPhone Air, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch Series 11. That new chip, plus the new Bluetooth chip, boosts Precision Finding's range by 50%. Precision Finding uses your iPhone to guide you to your AirTag, using haptics and visual and audio feedback to tell you when you're getting closer or further away. To be clear, the original AirTag also has a UWB chip that is compatible with Precision Finding, but this new UWB chip will make it easier to find an AirTag that isn't as close by.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2, the new AirTag marks the first time you'll be able to use Precision Finding. I'm not sure that's worth the upgrade, since you can always use Precision Finding with your iPhone, but it's certainly a nice perk if you happen to own one of these watches.\n\nPrecision Finding is helpful for finding your AirTag's whereabouts, but it might not help you locate it if it's hiding, like if it's stuck under a cushion. That's what the speaker is for: You can make your AirTag chirp, so you can find it easier when you're within listening range. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original, which should help when you really can't find your AirTag in your couch.\n\nThat's about all the updates Apple added to this newest AirTag—though you wouldn't know it from the press release. Apple sprinkles in existing AirTag features that might make you think they're fresh, but, really, these are just core features of all AirTags, both new and old.\n\nThis AirTag, like all AirTags, works within the Find My network: There's no inherent internet connection to enable tracking. Instead, the AirTag passively connects to any and all internet-connected Apple devices that are also connected to Find My—often, that means iPhones, but it can mean other devices like iPads and Macs. That enables features like Share Item Location, which lets you share your AirTags location with a third-party, like an airline. In that example, the airline can use that info to help find your luggage.\n\nThe new AirTag also carries over the same privacy and security features as the previous model. No data is stored on device, and all Find My communications are end-to-end encrypted. Whether you have this AirTag or the first, Apple can't see your AirTag, or any devices that connected it to the Find My network.\n\nApple also didn't change the price of the second-gen AirTag. One of these trackers runs you $29, while a four pack costs $99—a small savings if you want to buy that many. Unless you really need the newest ones, however, you might want to consider the previous gen, since you can pick up a four-pack for $69.99 on Amazon right now.",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "description": "It could be ChatGPT's next big competitor.",
    "fullText": "Last week, Apple finally admitted it will need to team up with Google to finally make good on that contextual Siri promise it made two years ago, which would have allowed the virtual assistant to integrate with content like your texts or emails to answer personal questions and take actions for you. Now, according to a new report, the iPhone company might actually go one step further and turn Siri into a full-fledged AI chatbot—one on par with the likes of ChatGPT, and perhaps even more sophisticated.\n\nCurrently, Siri has AI implementation, but only technically, and it's certainly underwhelming: You can use it to get tech support on Apple products or shunt questions off to ChatGPT, but otherwise, Siri basically works as it always has. But according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has reliably reported on insider information at Apple before, the company is finally not only looking to make Siri smarter, but also change the way you interact with it. Currently planned for iOS and macOS 27 under the name \"Campos,\" Siri's new chatbot interface will still be powered by Gemini, but will allow you to both type and talk to Siri, with full continuity between your conversations. This upgrade will be in addition to the overdue features that were already announced.\n\nIn other words, it'll look something like the chatbot interface from the ChatGPT app or the standalone Gemini app. Yes, you can technically type to Siri right now, but it mostly works like a separate input method, rather than as a full conversation. You can't scroll through your previous questions to Siri or peruse the assistant's previous answers, and if you ask Siri to reference a message you sent it two weeks ago, it'll have no idea what you mean. That's far behind what other AI chatbots offer right now.\n\nThe update will also apparently further expand Siri's capabilities even beyond the contextual or personalization upgrades that were already revealed. Gurman says that, while the contextual upgrades will be able to pull information from other apps like Messages, the chatbot-style Siri will be \"integrated into all of the company's core apps, including ones for mail, music, podcasts, TV, Xcode programming software and photos.\" Essentially, Siri will have more access to your iPhone than other AI chatbots, and those integrations will go beyond what was previously promised. That could make it more or less appealing to you, depending on your tastes in AI integration.\n\nWith the chatbot interface planned for iOS 27, it's likely to come after the contextual upgrades, rather than at the same time. That's because, as Gurman said previously, those upgrades are set for the spring. He predicts we'll learn more about it during this year's WWDC, which, if it follows the standard set by previous years, will take place in June.\n\nThe move to turn Siri into a chatbot could come across as a a much-overdue modernization, as Google has already done the same with Gemini over on Android, but it's also a bit of a surprise, as Apple had previously said it did not intend to turn Siri into a \"bolt-on chatbot on the side\" for Apple Intelligence.\n\nBut Apple was likely talking about quality of the experience rather than expressing any significant anti-chatbot bias among the development team, meaning the fact that Siri is turning into a chatbot could mean the company is finally happy with the direction it's headed. But it's also possible that the professed skepticism about turning Siri into a chatbot was meant to appeal to AI skeptics in general. Unfortunately, if you're still skeptical about AI, it currently seems like iOS 27 will be a boring update for you, as Gurman indicated the new Siri chatbot will be the \"primary new addition\" to the operating system.\n\nHowever you feel about it personally, Siri as a full-fledged AI chatbot could seriously upset ChatGPT's market dominance—ironic, given its early integration with Apple Intelligence. Currently, OpenAI has reportedly admitted it's in a Code Red situation, as it is losing market share to Google and introducing ads to bolster its bottom line. The new Siri, being powered by Gemini, is unlikely to hurt Google (although it will have more access to your phone than the standalone Gemini app), but its ease-of-access might make it the new go-to for iPhone users, and that could hurt pretty much every AI company Apple isn't in business with directly.",

    "fullText": "I’m an old Mac-head at heart, and I’ve been using Macs since the mid 1990s (the first Mac I used was an LC II with System 7.1 installed on it). I don’t tend to genuinely think that the computing experience was better in the olden days — sure, there’s a thing to be said about the simplicity of older software, but most of my fondness for those days is nostalgia.\n\nFor example, I have wonderful memories of finally getting a copy of ClarisWorks and being able to do pixel-based image editing, which sparked a wonderful childhood “career” of tinkering with icons and various other bits and bobs with that and ResEdit. The things you could do before code signing!\n\nHowever, I’m not going to sit here and say with a straight face that ClarisWorks on System 7 in the 1990s was better than using the myriad of tools we have available to us today. It’s nostalgia for a simpler time — both in computing, and in my life.\n\nAn exception to that, however, is Apple’s Aperture. I’m still grumpy that Apple discontinued it back in 2015, and I’m not alone. Start spending time in the online photography sphere and you’ll start to notice a small but undeniable undercurrent of lament of its loss to this day. Find an article about Adobe hiking their subscription prices because they added AI for some reason, and amongst the complaining in the comments you’ll invariably find it: “I miss Aperture.”\n\nA couple of things have happened recently that spurred me to actually write all of this down rather than grumble occasionally on social media:\n\nApple released macOS Tahoe, which has been pretty constantly raked over the coals for poor design and broken interactions from the day it was released (and even before, if we’re honest).\n\nApple very recently announced their Creator Studio subscription service, and I saw this post on Mastodon by @BasicAppleGuy:\n\nWhen I took this screenshot, the first reply to the post was “I miss Aperture. <long digital sigh>”.\n\nSo, I dug out the ‘ol Trashcan Mac Pro I lovingly reviewed here on this very blog over eleven years ago and fired up Aperture to document — at least partially — just why it was so special.\n\nThe Mac Studio is a perfectly cromulent computer, but it just doesn’t have the verve of the classics, you know?\n\nIf you’re not familiar with Aperture, it’s an app for organising, managing, editing, and exporting images. If you’re familiar with Apple’s Photos app, it’s that. But for professionals! Aperture is a complex app — its PDF user manual is over 900 pages long — so to keep this manageable I’ll focus on one particular aspect of it via two short excerpts from said manual.\n\nTwo excerpts that hide an astonishing amount of engineering effort.\n\nLet’s look at our first excerpt:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nThis little sentence extremely succinctly describes how Aperture is different to most other software of its nature — it comes to you. Most software has you go to it.\n\nTo understand what I mean, let’s look at the Photos app. My brain works pretty spatially — I remember where I took a photo more than when. So, I pan around the map in Photos to find the cool photo of my car in the Alps that I want to edit and send to my friend. Here it is:\n\nI click the picture, and the map is gone, replaced with a list of the images at the location I clicked.\n\nI double-click the photo to bring it up bigger.\n\nI click “Edit” in the top right of the window to switch into Photos’ editing mode (as a shortcut, I could’ve pressed the Return key in the image list to open it straight in the editing mode).\n\nI perform my edits, then click “Done” to get back to the fullscreen viewer. Then I click “Back” to get back to the list of images. Then “Back” again, and I’m finally back at my map. Hooray! Oh wait, I forgot to export it…\n\nThis sort of design is common in apps like Photos, and especially in “shoebox” apps1. Every feature is in its own place, and if you want to use that feature you need to pick up your thing (in this case, a photo) and take it over to where the feature is. In this example, the journey from the map to the editor is through a separate list of images, the fullscreen viewer, then finally to the editor.\n\nIn contrast, Aperture comes to you. As a reminder:\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nWhen Aperture says this, it really means it. If you can select an image, you can edit it right where you are with that HUD.\n\nAperture’s map (which by some miracle still works eleven years after it was discontinued) doesn’t show the images on the map, but rather underneath it. It’s less pretty, but combines the first two steps of the journey in the Photos example — the map on top, and the images in the visible map area underneath. Clicking a pin refines the selection of images.\n\nAlight, let’s find another photo of my car in the Alps:\n\nA Volvo stuck in the snow is less awesome than the previous photo, but oh well. I need to edit it, so I press H on my keyboard to bring up the adjustments HUD. I’m still exactly where I was, but now I have editing controls. There’s no step three!\n\nThat was incredibly easy, and I didn’t even leave the map! I need to export it now… and, of course, I can do that from right here on the map too.\n\nI’m still exactly where I was, and I can carry on with the next task.\n\n“But Daniel,” I hear you cry, “Who edits photos on a map?”\n\nFine, it’s a contrived example, but one I was able to directly make between Photos and Aperture. Let’s look at something more real-world: Aperture’s book editor. I love making photo books as the years go by, but putting them together can be a long and tedious process.\n\nLet’s imagine it’s 2005, and I have a page in my book full of pictures of my new car for this year’s book. Unfortunately, auto white balance and changing lighting conditions means the car is a different shade of grey in every photo! Disaster!\n\nIt’d be nice to have them consistent with each other on the page, but matching them all together when they might be from all over the photo library is a big pain. Can you imagine doing that in Photos? Click, click, click, click, into the editor. Tweak white balance. Click, click, click, click, back to the book. Nope, still not right. Click, click, click, click…\n\nTo work efficiently in Aperture, you can use floating windows of controls called heads-up displays (HUDs) to modify images.\n\nOh, right! H, drag slider, done. Right on the book page.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate quite how revolutionary and smooth this flow is until you had it for multiple years before having it taken away. Nothing on the market — even over a decade later — is this good at meeting you where you are and not interrupting your flow.\n\nEspecially that book example. My Lord. When Aperture was discontinued (well, when it stopped working properly after an OS update or two) I moved over to Adobe Lightroom (now Lightroom Classic) which had separate modules for file management, editing, and books — switching modules was such a slow and clunky processes, I swear nearly threw my computer out the window trying to colour match photos on a book page.\n\nIt’s OK, Daniel, you got rid of Lightroom years ago. It can’t hurt you any more!\n\nTechnically speaking, the edit-anywhere model is an incredibly impressive feature. Managing a lot of images is already difficult2 (especially on the hardware of the time), and for a map, or a book editor… of course you’d have an optimised set of static thumbnails.\n\nOr, y’know, a full RAW image editing context ready-to-go for anything you might want to click on.\n\nAperture has a tool called the “loupe”. In real life, a loupe is a little cup with a magnifying glass on the top. It’s what’s on the Preview app’s icon, and you use it to zoom in to physical things on a physical surface (I know, how quaint).\n\nIf you want to quickly check specific compositional details of an image, you can use the Loupe. Aperture provides a software Loupe that lets you magnify portions of an image. The Loupe is particularly useful when you are quickly navigating through images in the Browser and you need to verify that the image is in focus or other details without having to switch to the Viewer or Full Screen view.\n\nIn Aperture, the loupe is a little round zoomy thing you can either drag around to view a zoomed-in portion of the image it’s on top of, or attach to the mouse so you can just point at stuff to zoom in.\n\nNote: I’ve dimmed the main Aperture window slightly in the following screenshots to make the loupe clearer.\n\nFun fact: Even when attached to the mouse, the loupe is a separate window just like the other HUDs — which means you can take a screenshot of it independently. Neat!\n\nIt’d be easy to think this is just a screen zoom, or at least a window into a big thumbnail that’s being downsampled a bit for the main viewer. But, since the loupe is attached to the mouse, we can just start pointing at stuff to see what happens.\n\nThere’s no way you’d keep a full-resolution image in memory for every thumbnail on screen, so this is another extremely impressive technical feat. Remember, this is over a decade ago, and Aperture’s system requirements were a Mac with 2GB of RAM. Keeping a whole 20 megapixel image in memory will consume somewhere in the region of 90-120MB3 once you’re starting to display it.\n\nHmm… now that I think about it, the manual doesn’t say where the loupe works and doesn’t, and since we’re not limited to selecting images like with the other HUD…\n\nOnce again, it’s hard to overstate how bonkers this is on a technical level. That’s a list of thumbnails of book pages, there so you can identify which page you want to edit. That thumbnail-within-a-thumbanail — on a Retina display! — is 68x47 pixels. 0.003 megapixels.\n\nFrom a software development perspective, it would be insane to have those pages be anything but static thumbnail images. But hey, would you want to be the person that made the manual say that the loupe works everywhere except in the book editor’s page list?\n\nThese days, technological marvels in computing — if you’ll forgive a gross generalisation — tend to be very flashy. Liquid Glass is a great example of that — it’s very impressive what can be done with the engineering talent and computing power we have available to us today, and the effect is cool. However, my browser’s UI refracting the webpage I’m reading as it scrolls by doesn’t really do anything except look cool… when it isn’t making things less readable.\n\nNotice how the Liquid Glass refraction effect makes it look — at first glance, at least — like we’ll be making a sharp right after we turn left? Thanks, Liquid Glass!\n\nGenerative AI is another technology that falls into this “flashy” camp, but kinda at the other end of the scale. BEHOLD THE AI, FOR IT IS PRODUCING CONTENT. Very useful, very impressive, and is transforming a lot of industries. Just… ignore the wider societal and environmental concerns AS THE AI IS PRODUCING A FUNNY POEM.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss criticisms of these kinds of technologies as the ramblings of an old man, since on average — as I mentioned at the top of this post — the computing experience is orders of magnitude better than it was back then.\n\nHowever, when it gets to the point where we as humans need to use our computers as tools to get stuff done, I think we have stagnated over the past few years. When preparing for this post I was excited to fire up Aperture and experience it again, but after less than ten minutes of using it I was getting grumpy — here I am, sitting at a thirteen-year old computer, and I’m flying through my photos faster than I ever do on modern machines. Why is this not possible now?\n\nAperture’s technical brilliance is remarkable in how quiet it is. There’s no BEHOLD RAINBOW SPARKLE ANIMATIONS WHILE THE AI MAKES AUNT JANICE LOOK LIKE AN ANTHROPOMORPHISED CARROT, just an understated dedication to making the tool you’re using work for you in exactly the way you want to work.\n\nIt’s the kind of monumental engineering effort that the user is unlikely to ever notice, simply because of how obvious it is to use — if I want to zoom in to this photo, I point at it with the zoom thing. Duh. Sure, it’s a tiny thumbnail inside a small thumbnail of a page in a book… but how else would it work?\n\nAnd that is why Aperture was so special. It was powered by some of the most impressive technology around at the time, but you’d never even know it because you were too busy getting shit done.\n\nAnd then, it was taken away — with a final, cruel twist of the knife from Apple: “You can use the Photos app as a replacement!” — and everyone was grumpy forever.\n\nAperture’s discontinuation happened at the tail end of my time working at Spotify here in Sweden. As with any corporate job, it had good days and bad days… and after the particularly bad days, I’d rage-fill part of a job application elsewhere. I’d always loved Aperture — as a Mac developer, it was the pinnacle of what was possible on the Mac, and in a field I was passionate about — so this particular application was to work on Aperture at Apple.\n\nI ended up having a couple of interviews with the Aperture team, but as I remember (this was well over a decade ago) the process just… kinda petered out.\n\nA few months later, the official discontinuation announcement happened. I have no idea if I was just not up to the task or if something happened internally during my interview process, but it’s an interesting “What if…” to think about.\n\nAperture: Senior QA (2004-2005) by Chris Hynes \n\nWhile the result was amazing, the development process was… perhaps less so. This is an interesting read about Aperture’s development.\n\nIt’s hard to justify Tahoe icons by Nikita Prokopov \n\nA great look on why (amongst many other reasons) macOS Tahoe is being raked through the coals at the moment.\n\n“Shoebox” apps are apps that contain the content you use with them, as opposed to document-based apps which work with content you manage as a user. It’s an extremely common design nowadays, but less so back then — early pioneers of the shoebox app were iPhoto, iMovie, etc. ↩\n\nI maintain that one of the most technically impressive app on an iPhone is the Photos app’s thumbnail grid – being able to scroll that many images that smoothly is very hard. ↩\n\nMaths: 20 million pixels at 12-16 bits per channel. Doesn’t include overheads of getting from the encoded RAW to a GPU-ready pixel buffer. ↩",

    "description": "Apple once set the bar for suppliers including TSMC. Now it's being unseated by Nvidia and AI cloud giants.",
    "fullText": "For over a decade, Apple sat at the center of the tech supply chain. Its enormous scale let it dictate pricing, lock up capacity, and steer the roadmaps of suppliers that made everything from chips and memory to substrates and packaging. That era is ending.\n\n\"Apple is no longer the gravitational center of the hardware universe,\" said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology, who tracks the industry's supply chain.\n\n\"Apple still moves huge volumes and has unmatched brand strength. But the company is no longer the anchor client for fabs, substrate makers, or key component suppliers. That's a fundamental change.\"\n\nThis is important because the tech companies that control the supply chain are more likely to win. When you can order the largest amount of a key component, you get better pricing and a more reliable supply. That results in better-priced products that are available sooner than your rivals. This power is now shifting toward AI giants, including Nvidia and huge cloud players such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google (aka \"AMG\").\n\nThe most visible sign is at TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker. It's famous for churning out cutting-edge iPhone chips, which gave Apple a huge advantage over other consumer hardware players.\n\nWhen TSMC reported results this week, it became very clear that its smartphone business is no longer its most important segment. High-performance computing — a category dominated by AI chips for companies like Nvidia and hyperscale cloud providers — now accounts for roughly 58% of TSMC's revenue, far surpassing smartphone processors.\n\nTSMC makes chips for Nvidia's AI servers, which are being snapped up in huge volumes by the cloud giants. They pack this gear into huge data centers that train and run AI models to power new services such as ChatGPT. Is that a better business than making iPhone chips?\n\nTSMC's CEO C.C. Wei answered that. He's been talking to these AI giants a lot lately. Here's what he said on this week's earnings call:\n\n\"They show me the evidence that the AI really helps their business. So they grow their business successfully and see the financial return. So I also double-checked their financial status. They are very rich.\"\n\nSuppliers go where the money is. Increasingly, the biggest Benjamins are coming from AI and cloud giants, not Apple.\n\nThis shift is rippling through the rest of the supply chain. Memory chip makers are reallocating capacity away from phones and PCs to feed AI data centers hungry for DRAM, dynamic random access memory. This is a common type of memory chip that's used in AI servers and iPhones.\n\nMemory prices have surged lately, and that's likely to push up smartphone costs and potentially squeeze margins. Nvidia has locked in long-term memory supply, leaving smartphone makers with less negotiating power.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, Apple's scale let it dictate component supply, pricing, and roadmaps,\" Gastwirth said. \"That leverage diminishes when suppliers earn higher margins and higher growth from AI customers than from smartphones.\"\n\nBottlenecks are emerging in unexpected places, too. A shortage of high-end glass cloth, a critical input for chip substrates, has suppliers prioritizing AI customers who pre-pay and sign multi-year contracts.\n\nApple, which uses these substrates across nearly all its products, is now competing with AI chipmakers for limited supply and even sending engineers to help smaller suppliers qualify alternative materials, according to a report this week from Nikkei.\n\nManufacturing partners are also re-prioritizing. Foxconn, once synonymous with iPhone assembly, now generates more revenue from AI servers than from consumer electronics. Its fastest-growing customers are hyperscalers and Nvidia, not Apple.\n\nNone of this makes Apple irrelevant. The company remains one of the world's largest buyers of components. However, in a supply chain increasingly shaped by AI, pricing, allocation, and capacity planning are being set elsewhere — and Apple is learning what it's like to be just another very large customer.\n\n\"In the 2010s, Apple set the pace for the supply chain,\" Gastwirth said. \"In the late 2020s, Nvidia, hyperscalers, and AI infrastructure now dictate pricing, allocation, and long‑term capacity planning.\"\n\nApple didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "India issues a final warning to Apple in its antitrust case, signaling action after delays over App Store practices.",
    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

I divorced Los Angeles.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star described the experience of her kids leaving the family home as \"a big reckoning,\" which forced her to let go of part of her identity.\n\n\"When you're a parent, it's like you're orienting everything around the child, right? And everything is around their emotional needs, their soccer practice, their dinner, you know. It's so relentless, and it's so intense. And when they go, it's like it forces this major reorientation,\" she said.\n\n\"Marty Supreme,\" which was released in theatres on Christmas Day, is the first movie Paltrow has acted in since 2019. When Fragoso asked if her decision to take the job was linked to her becoming an empty nester, she said, \"very much so.\"\n\n\"I panicked in a sense.

Our technology expert compares the top Apple smartwatches available right now\n\nThe best running watches – tested\n\nThe best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.\n\nEach generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

We make more kernel logging available on iOS and build a log aggregator that combines and aligns system- and network-level log sources from iOS and macOS.\n\nApple's Continuity features make up a big part of their walled garden. From AirDrop and Handoff to AirPlay, they all connect macOS and iOS devices wirelessly. In recent years, security researchers have opened up several of these features showing that the Apple ecosystem is technically compatible with third-party devices.\n\nIn this talk, we present the internal workings of Low-Latency WiFi (LLW) – Apple's link-layer protocol for several real-time Continuity features like Continuity Camera and Sidecar Display. We talk about the concepts behind LLW, how it achieves its low-latency requirement and how we got there in the reverse engineering process.\n\nWe also present the tooling we built to enable more kernel-level tracing and logging on iOS through a reimplementation of cctool from macOS and the source code of trace that was buried deep inside of Apple’s open-source repository system_cmds. We build a log aggregator that combines various kernel- and user-space traces, log messages and pcap files from both iOS and macOS into a single file and finally investigate the network stack on Apple platforms that is implemented in both user- and kernel space. There we find interesting configuration values of LLW that make it the go-to link-layer protocol for Apple's proprietary real-time Continuity applications.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "fullText": "The latest iOS update has hit Apple products, and you can now download it to your iPhone.\n\nSince September, iPhone users have had the chance to update their phones to iOS 26, Apple's software update that ushered in new features like the Liquid Glass design and tools powered by Apple Intelligence. While iOS 26.1 came out in November to mixed reviews, the latest version of the iOS, 26.2, launched last month.\n\nThe latest update is set to enhance certain apps and install security updates on users' devices. If you're looking to update your Apple device, here's what to know about iOS 26.2.\n\niOS 26.2 is the latest Apple software update, released on Dec. 12, 2025. Among the new features mentioned for 26.2 are enhancements to apps Apple Music, Podcasts, and Games. The update brings new ways to customize the look and visibility of the liquid glass design on lock screens and home screens, which creates a see-through, bubble effect, according to the description of the software.\n\nUsers can also now add alarms created in the Clock app into the reminders they create in the Reminders app, according to Apple Insider. In the Podcasts app, users can experience automatically created chapters based on the podcasts' transcripts along with easier ways to navigate the media to find specific mentions or moments.\n\nThe update also includes new security patches and fixes flaws in the last iOS, iOS 26.1. The update does not state what flaws existed in the last iOS, and for the protection Apple customers, the company \"doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and patches or releases are generally available,\" according to Apple.\n\nMore: Like it or not, iOS 26 is here. What to know about the iPhone update.\n\niOS 26.1 went live in November and brought the liquid glass feature to lock screens and home screens. The description also touts live translation features, updates to messages, and enhancements to camera, photos, wallet, CarPlay, and more.\n\nMore on iOS: Apple's iOS 26 update is coming.

If there is an update, tap to download and install it.\n\nOnce you've updated to iOS 26, Apple does not let you downgrade to iOS 18, the USA TODAY Network reported.\n\nSome iPhone users have taken to social media to voice their concerns with the entirety of the iOS 26 update, including calling the liquid glass design \"ugly\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nA Dec. 8 post on Reddit went as far as to warn other users to \"save yourself\" from the latest update.\n\n\"I can't focus. It's disorienting,\" the user wrote, saying that the app \"takes up too much space.\"\n\nDO NOT UPDATE TO IOS 26 I GOT TRICKED BY MY PHONE ITS SO AWFUL\n\n— little gremlin (@frankieplsrelax) December 9, 2025\n\nUsers on X shared similar feelings, with multiple people saying their phones automatically updated to iOS 26 and they now regret the change. One person advised others not to download the update, adding \"Your life will be significantly worse after.\"\n\nSome iPhone users, though, are embracing the bubbly new design. One X user praised the new liquid glass feature, calling its interactions beautiful, while another posted a photo of their screen with the caption \"i love ios 26 lowkey.\"\n\nThese Bubbly interactions are some of the most beautiful aspects of Liquid Glass on iOS 26 ! pic.twitter.com/gypWJLMF0j\n\n— Minimal Nerd (@minimalnerd1) December 10, 2025\n\nParis Barraza contributed to this report.\n\nKate Perez covers national trends and breaking news for USA TODAY.

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "description": "Start using an app on your Android, then continue where you left off on your PC.",
    "fullText": "Love it or hate it, the Apple ecosystem really does have its perks. Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great.\n\nMicrosoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps.\n\nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board.\n\nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible.\n\nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.\n\nIt's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability.\n\nThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.",

In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The “more intelligent” version of Siri that Apple plans to release later this year will be backed by Google’s Gemini language models, the company announced today. CNBC reports that the deal is part of a “multi-year partnership” between Apple and Google that will allow Apple to use Google’s AI models in its own software.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we’re excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,” reads an Apple statement given to CNBC.\n\nToday’s announcement confirms Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reporting late last year that Apple and Google were nearing a deal. Apple didn’t disclose terms, but Gurman said that Apple would be paying Google “about $1 billion a year” for access to its AI models “following an extensive evaluation period.”\n\nBloomberg has also reported that the Gemini model would be run on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute servers, “ensuring that user data remains walled off from Google’s infrastructure,” and that Apple still hopes to improve its own in-house language models to the point that they can eventually be used instead of relying on third-party models.\n\nAlthough Apple’s iPhones and iOS compete with Google’s Android operating system and the many smartphones that use it, the companies still cooperate in plenty of other areas. Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (though that deal has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years).\n\nApple’s announcement is a blow to OpenAI and the many versions of its ChatGPT model, which Apple has used elsewhere in iOS and macOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple also tested OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude models before deciding to go with Gemini. ChatGPT came out ahead of Gemini in tests that Ars ran using earlier versions of the models, but Google’s models have apparently improved enough (and amassed enough users) to worry OpenAI; CEO Sam Altman declared a “code red” last month and pushed back several planned ChatGPT features so that the company could better respond to Google’s Gemini 3 release.\n\nApple originally promised the improved, AI-powered Siri for 2024’s iOS 18 release, but ultimately delayed the feature because it didn’t work reliably enough. The new version of Siri should arrive in an update to iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 Tahoe later this year.",

Last week, the company overtook Apple as the second most valuable company behind Nvidia.\n\nSpeculation of a potential deal has been circulating since last year. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was considering paying $1 billion a year to use the Gemini model.\n\n\"This is what the Street has been waiting for with the elephant in the room for Cupertino revolving around its invisible AI strategy,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note on Monday morning, referring to Apple's Cupertino headquarters, \"but we believe this is an incremental positive to both AAPL and GOOGL as a major validation moment for Google as a premier foundation model and for Apple as a stepping stone to accelerate its AI strategy into 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nApple had a head start in the AI assistant race when it launched Siri on its iOS devices in 2011.\n\nHowever, the iPhone maker has lagged behind the competition following the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple has delayed several upgrades to Siri, and Apple shook up its AI division late last year.\n\nFor Google, integration with the leading mobile phone platform in the US is yet another distribution advantage. In addition to being available via a stand-alone app, Gemini powers some Google search features, and it's also the default AI assistant on the company's Pixel smartphones.\n\nThomas Hudson, a VP principal analyst at the research firm Forrester, told Business Insider that the deal could \"look counterintuitive\" given Apple and Google compete in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, he pointed to Google's long-running deal to make it the default search engine on Apple's iPhones as an example of how the pair have partnered before. In December, a federal judge ordered Google to limit search and AI app contracts to a one-year term.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple TV User Should Know",
    "description": "You don't actually have to use the remote your Apple TV comes with.",
    "fullText": "Like many Apple devices, your Apple TV works pretty well right out of the box. You plug it in, download your favorite streaming services, and you're off—while much of your data stays put. But while this is a perfectly fine way to watch shows and movies, there are things you can (and should) change to make your Apple TV work even better. Here are 10 such hacks every Apple TV owner should consider using:\n\nThe first time I booted up my Apple TV after updating to tvOS 26, I was greeted with a full-screen profile selector. I soon found out I have to deal with this screen every time I turn on my Apple TV. For a large household that wants separate recommendations and history, that might make sense. But for my TV, choosing my profile instead my wife’s every single time is more of an annoyance.\n\nIf you’re in the same boat, you can disable this screen from Settings > Profile and Accounts. Here, disable the Choose Profile on Wake option. Disabling this feature doesn’t delete the profiles: You can still switch between them using the Power button.\n\nAny time I set up a new Apple TV (or end up resetting mine), this is the setting I change first. For a couple of years, pressing the TV button on the Apple TV remote opens the TV app, instead of taking you back home. To go back to the Home screen, you have to press and hold the TV button instead. Annoying. Thankfully, there is a setting to change this. Go to Settings > Remotes and Devices > TV Button, and switch to Home Screen. Now, pressing the TV button will take you home instead.\n\nIf the Apple TV app is your go-to for TV and movies, there's an easy way to disable autoplaying videos. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Auto-Play Video Previews > Off.\n\nWhile this is the only app that has this setting built into your Apple TV, you can disable autoplaying videos for your other apps too, such as for Netflix and Prime. While each service has its own way of disabling auto-playing videos, you'll likely find similar solutions for each. To change this setting for Netflix and Prime Video, for example, you’ll have to use their respective websites. Open the Netflix website, click on the Profile icon, go to Manage Profiles, choose a profile, and then click Playback Settings. Next, disable Autoplay previews. Then, log out of your account on Apple TV and log in again to see the update. For Prime video, click the Profile Icon, go to Account & Settings > Player and turn the Autoplay video and live events feature Off.\n\nI like the touchpad gesture on the Apple TV. Swiping on it is second nature to me. But whenever my parents use the Apple TV remote they always struggle with it. They prefer the D-pad buttons for moving around, but always send up swiping on the touchpad accidentally. If you have kids or elderly using the Apple TV remote often, you might want to disable the gesture altogether.\n\nGo to Settings > Remote and Devices > Clickpad, and switch to Click Only. Now, the center button will operate as a regular Click or “OK” button, but you won’t be able to use it as a touchpad, which should cut down on some confusion.\n\nIt’s way too easy to lose your Apple TV remote, but, luckily, you don't actually need it. If you have your iPhone nearby, or if you’re wearing your Apple Watch, you can control your Apple TV directly from your Apple devices. On your iPhone, open Control Center, then tap the Apple TV remote button. If you don’t see it, tap and hold the empty part of Control Center to edit the layout. Here, search for and add the Apple TV control. If you’re on the same network, you will see your Apple TV listed here. The first time you connect, you might need to authenticate with a code. Once enabled, you can control playback and navigate the device from your iPhone.\n\nIt’s the same story on the Apple Watch too, but here, it’s a dedicated app. Open the Remote app from your Apple Watch, select the Apple TV around you, and start controlling it.\n\nDid you know you can use a HomePod or any AirPlay-enabled speakers as the default media output for your Apple TV? If you have two wireless speakers, they can even default as a stereo pair. And since HomePods are always paired to your Apple TV, you won’t have to change the sound output every single time you start watching something.\n\nTo set this up on your Apple TV, go to Settings > Video and Audio > Audio Output and then choose the HomePod or the stereo pair as the default output. If you have two HomePods, you’ll first need to set them up a stereo pair from the Home app on your iPhone (follow Apple’s instructions here).\n\nIf you want to watch something at night without waking up your entire family, you should use your AirPods with your Apple TV. As with other Apple devices, AirPods are tightly integrated with Apple TV software. You’ll just need to connect them from Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth first.\n\nThe next time you put them on, you’ll see a suggestion from Apple TV to connect to your AirPods automatically. From here, press and hold the TV/Home button, and they'll connect. You can also use Control Center to quickly switch audio output to AirPods or any Bluetooth audio source. Open Control Center using the Power button, then select the audio output button.\n\nApple TV is like any other device you own. As such, there are times when a tvOS app misbehaves or gets stuck. For me, it’s usually Netflix. Instead of waiting around to fix the mess, you can force-quit an app just like you can on the iPhone. Double-press the TV button to open the app switcher. Then, swipe up on an app to close it. Relaunch the app to fix common issues like audio lag, buffering, and playback issues.\n\nApple TV is a powerful piece of hardware, but if you’re using an older one, sometimes it can start to lag. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Notion and enable the Reduce Motion feature to speed up animations. This way, at least the Apple TV will feel snappier, as you won’t have to wait for elaborate animations.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, your TV shouldn’t notify you about anything. Apple TV, however, notifies you about things like incoming phone and FaceTime calls, Home app updates from your webcam setup, and workout notifications from the Fitness app. To disable them, head to Settings > Notifications, then disable alerts for any and all apps. If you don't want to turn off notifications entirely, you can always press the Power button once to open Control Center and flip on Do Not Disturb.\n\nAdditionally, you can disable call notifications from your iPhone itself. Go to Settings > Phone > Calls on Other Devices and disable the Apple TV option.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.\n\nThe tech companies ​have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, ‌lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.\n\nThe plan is part of Prime Minister Narendra ‌Modi's efforts to boost security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world's second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.\n\nIT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that \"any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind\", adding it was \"premature to read more into it\". A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.\n\nONGOING TUG OF WAR OVER GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nApple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian ⁠industry group that represents the firms, did not respond ‌to requests for comment.\n\nIndian government requirements have irked technology firms before. Last month it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security ‍cameras over fears of Chinese spying.\n\nXiaomi and Samsung - whose phones use Google's Android operating system - hold 19% and 15%, respectively, of India's market share and Apple 5%, Counterpoint Research estimates.\n\nAmong the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code - the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly ​tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.\n\nThe Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to ‌block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to \"avoid malicious usage\".\n\n\"Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,\" said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.\n\nThe security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.\n\nCOMPANIES SAY SOURCE CODE REVIEW, ANALYSIS 'NOT POSSIBLE'\n\nSmartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China's request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and U.S. law enforcement has also tried and failed to ⁠get it.\n\nIndia's proposals for \"vulnerability analysis\" and \"source code review\" would require smartphone makers to perform a \"complete ​security assessment\", after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and ​analysis.\n\n\"This is not possible ... due to secrecy and privacy,\" MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters. \"Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.\"\n\nMAIT asked the ministry last ‍week to drop the proposal, a source ⁠with direct knowledge said.\n\nThe Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones. Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.\n\nMAIT's ⁠document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone's battery and seeking government approval for software updates is \"impractical\" as they need to be issued promptly.\n\nIndia also wants the phone's logs - digital records ‌of its system activity - to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.\n\n\"There is not enough room on device to store ‌1-year log events,\" MAIT said in the document.",

    "fullText": "The Apple iPhone is the most popular mobile phone line in the United States and one of the most popular series of devices in the world with an estimated 1.6 billion iPhone users across the globe. Unfortunately, many of those users are now at risk.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Apple has been issuing a warning about a security flaw that data shows would impact around half of those iPhone users, which is around 800 million.\n\nLate last month, Apple began warning users of two critical flaws found in WebKit, which is the browser engine that powers Safari and all browsers on iOS. The flaws left iPhone users vulnerable an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" which would targeting specific individuals.\n\nApple said that the critical flaw could allow hackers to be able to take control of an iPhone or iPad by using malicious websites on the compromised web browsers and trick the device into executing harmful instructions.\n\nThe flaw left users vulnerable to hackers who could potentially take controll of the iPhone or iPad or run code without your permission, possibly obtaining passwords or payment information.\n\nThe good news is that Apple has already created a patch to correct the vulnerability in its latest software update. However, those that have not installed the software update are vulnurable.\n\nForbes estimates that 50% of all eligible iPhone users have yet to upgrade from iOS 18 to iOS 26. Given that there are more than 1.6 billion iPhone users worldwide, this means that around 800 million devices are still vulnerable. StatCounter has an even more pessimistic view, estimating that just 20% of users have upgraded, which would leave more than 1.2 billion iPhone users vulnerable.\n\nAccording to Apple, the devices most at risk include the iPhone 11 and later, the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), and the iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later). Other vulnerable models include the iPad Air (3rd generation and later), the iPad (8th generation and later), and the iPad mini (5th generation and later).\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to protect yourself from these vulnerabilities is upgrade to the latest version of iOS, which is iOS 26.2.\n\nWhile it was expected that Apple would make a security update for users wanting to stick with iOS 18 for a bit longer, that is no longer the case, as iOS 18.7.3 is not available unless you’re running an iPhone that can’t run iOS 26.\n\n“There’s no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully mitigates this risk,” says Keeper Security’s Darren Guccione, via Forbes.\n\nHe went on to explain that upgrading to the latest version of the software is \"the only effective defense. Once patches are public, the exposure window widens for anyone who delays updating.”\n\nThe good news is that installing the update is easy. In fact, for users with automatic updates enabled, the software should be up to date and the patch should already be installed.\n\nIf you do not have automatic updates enabled, you will need to manually download iOS 26.2 or iPadOS 26.2 through their device settings. In this case, users should simply open the \"settings\" app then click \"general\" followed by \"software update.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Below are key security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, prompting ​opposition from tech companies, according to four sources, as well as industry and government ‌documents seen by Reuters.\n\nManufacturers must test and provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs to ‌identify vulnerabilities in phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers.\n\nIndustry group MAIT, which represents Apple, South Korea's Samsung, Google, China's Xiaomi, has told the government this is \"not possible\" due to corporate secrecy and global privacy policies.\n\nBACKGROUND PERMISSION RESTRICTIONS:\n\nApps cannot access cameras, microphones or location services in ⁠the background when phones are inactive. ‌Continuous status bar notifications are required when these permissions are active.\n\nManufacturers say this lacks any global precedent and there is no specific test method ‍prescribed.\n\nDevices must periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. Companies say notice should be limited to \"highly critical\" permissions.\n\nDevices must store security audit logs, including ​app installations and login attempts, for 12 months.\n\nMAIT argues consumer phones lack the storage capacity ‌for a year of data.\n\nPhones must periodically scan for malware and identify potentially harmful applications.\n\nManufacturers warn that constant on-device scanning significantly drains the battery and slows hardware performance.\n\nOPTION TO REMOVE PRE-INSTALLED APPS:\n\nAll pre-installed apps bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions, must be deletable.\n\nCompanies argue many apps are critical system components that cannot be ⁠removed.\n\nINFORMING GOVERNMENT OF MAJOR UPDATES:\n\nPhone makers must notify a ​government organisation before releasing any major updates or security ​patches.\n\nManufacturers argue this is \"impractical\" because security fixes must be released quickly to protect users from active exploits, while government delays could leave users vulnerable.\n\nDevices ‍must detect if phones have ⁠been rooted or \"jailbroken\", where users bypass built-in security restrictions, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures.\n\nCompanies say there is no reliable mechanism to detect jailbreaking.\n\nPhones ⁠must permanently block installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security ‌downgrades.\n\nThere is no global standard related to this requirement, manufacturers say.",

    "description": "Apple Wallet taking up 4GB on your iPhone? Here’s why it happens, what causes the storage spike, and how you can fix it safely.",
    "fullText": "We use the Wallet app without thinking too much about it. It holds our cards, tickets, and passes, and it usually stays out of the way. You check Settings > General > iPhone Storage and see something that makes no sense: Wallet shows nearly 4GB in Documents and Data. You delete your passes, remove cards, even delete and reinstall the app, but the number stays the same.\n\nIf you feel stuck, you are not alone. People have reported Wallet storage that looks wildly out of proportion to what the app does.\n\nWallet does more than store a few cards. It also holds local files tied to passes and payment features. That storage can add up, especially if something goes wrong.\n\nIn short, you did the right first steps. If Wallet still shows 4GB after a reinstall, you need to force iOS to rebuild whatever Wallet keeps locally.\n\nWork through these in order. You will usually get results before the last step.\n\n1) Restart your iPhone\nA restart sounds basic, but it can flush stuck indexing and temporary caches. After you restart, re-check iPhone Storage to see if Wallet drops.\n\n2) Update iOS, then check storage again\nIf you run an older build, update first. Storage bugs often ride along in iOS releases and Apple fixes them quietly. After the update finishes, give your phone a few minutes on Wi-Fi and power, then check Wallet storage again.\n\n3) Remove Wallet content the “full” way\nEven if you already deleted passes, do a clean sweep:\n\nThen restart again and re-check storage.\n\n4) Sign out of iCloud and sign back in\nThis step often forces iOS apps that sync data to rebuild local databases.\n\nThen check Wallet storage again.\n\n5) Back up, then reset as the “break glass” fix\nIf Wallet still sits at multiple gigabytes, treat it like a system-level storage bug. You see similar behavior in other Apple apps when their Documents and Data gets stuck, and the most reliable fix becomes a full reset after backup.\n\nThis takes longer, but it gives iOS a clean slate. In many “storage won’t clear” cases, it is the only step that truly resets the hidden cache.\n\nA big Wallet number does not automatically mean someone hacked you. People who never use Wallet still see some Wallet storage, and Apple Support forum threads show that small amounts can appear even when you do nothing with the app.\n\nThe issue here is scale. Gigabytes usually mean a stuck cache, a database that never compacts, or a system bug that keeps re-growing the same files.",

Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), and Ed Markey (D-MA) wrote that “X’s generation of these harmful and likely illegal depictions of women and children has shown complete disregard for your stores’ distribution terms.” X users have identified several cases where Grok undressed or sexualized apparent minors in the AI-created images.\n\nThe senators point to the app stores’ own policies for why the app should be removed. Google’s terms of service say that apps are subject to removal if they fail to bar users from “creating, uploading, or distributing content that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children” or portray kids “in a manner that could result in the sexual exploitation of children.” Apple prohibits apps that are “offensive” or “just plain creepy.” Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether X was in compliance with their policies and whether they planned to remove the app.\n\nFailing to remove X from the app stores would both show a double standard, and undermine the companies’ arguments for their control over the app stores in the first place, the lawmakers write. Both companies removed ICEBlock and Red Dot from their stores following government pressure. The apps were used to anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. “Unlike Grok’s sickening content generation, these apps were not creating or hosting harmful or illegal content, and yet, based entirely on the Administration’s claims that they posed a risk to immigration enforcers, you removed them from your stores,” the senators wrote.\n\nThey also warned that inaction would “undermine your claims in public and in court that your app stores offer a safer user experience than letting users download apps directly to their phones. This principle has been core to your advocacy against legislative reforms to increase app store competition and your defenses to claims that your app stores abuse their market power through their payment systems.”",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple HomePod User Should Know",
    "description": "Get more out of Apple's smart speaker.",
    "fullText": "The HomePod is one of the most polarizing Apple devices I've ever owned. When it works, it's awesome, but if anything goes wrong, it can be a bit of a head-scratcher to troubleshoot. That's led to a bit of a mixed reception among Apple fans, but I've been buying HomePods since 2017, and know all the hacks to help make them easier or better to use. Some of these hacks are geared towards trouble-free usage, but others highlight hidden features. Let's dive right in.\n\nIn all my experience with HomePods, I've observed that the product just works a lot better when it's in a place with a strong wifi signal. For a few months, I'd kept the HomePod in a bedroom where my wifi was a bit flaky, and the speaker did not perform well at all. Since it uses either the internet or AirPlay to play sound, it needs a strong wifi signal. If your house has a single router, you may have better luck connecting your HomePod to the 2.4GHz band as opposed to the 5GHz option, which has a shorter range.\n\nYou can check which network your HomePod is connected to by going to the Home app on your iPhone, selecting your HomePod, and going to Accessory Settings. The smart speaker automatically connects to the same network that your iPhone or iPad is connected to. You can switch the wifi network on your iOS device to change the connected wifi on the HomePod.\n\nSince we're talking about increasing the reliability of your HomePod, you'll find that pairing it with your Apple TV will make it far less flaky. This is not to say that you should go out and buy an Apple TV just to make your HomePod work better, but if you do have the streaming device, you should consider pairing it with your HomePod for the best results.\n\nI've used my HomePods with my iPhone, Mac, iPad, and even my Apple Watch, and I can tell you that the experience is just not the same as when using the speaker with an Apple TV. For starters, the Apple TV can use a HomePod as a default output, which means that you don't have to fiddle with software buttons or use Siri to operate the speaker. You just switch on your Apple TV, play anything you like, and the HomePod will just work. That may sound like a minor benefit, but it's really not. I don't have many good things to say about the HomePod's software and reliability, and it's only been 100% solid when I've used it with an Apple TV.\n\nI don't usually tell people to spend more money to make the most of a product, but in the case of Apple's HomePods, two speakers are a lot better than just one. If you have the bigger HomePod, you'll probably be fine with just one of those, but that's not true for those of us who have opted for a HomePod mini. Using two HomePod minis in a stereo pair is a much better experience, taking what can be underwhelming audio and letting it play with the big boys. And that goes double if you followed through on that last hack. If you have an Apple TV, you're going to be really impressed when connecting it to two HomePods in a stereo pair. It makes watching movies so much better.\n\nHDMI ARC is one of the least-known features of the HomePod, but once you try it, there's no going back. In a nutshell, it lets you use the HomePod as a speaker for your PS5, Xbox, or any other device connected to your TV. It requires a pretty specific combination of hardware to work, and even after having that in place, you may have to troubleshoot it a bit to get it working correctly. This is because there are at least four different devices made by different manufacturers involved here. Sometimes you might need to manually enable ARC, eARC, or HDMI-CEC in your TV's settings, which usually does the trick.\n\nThis Apple Support page highlights everything you need to make this feature work, which boils down to having an Apple TV 4K (second-gen or newer), a HomePod or a HomePod mini, and a TV that supports HDMI ARC or eARC (usually, TV manufacturers label the HDMI ports to indicate support for these technologies). You'll have to enable this feature on your Apple TV first, and once you do that, the HomePod should play sound from other devices connected to your TV. Note that you need to add the Apple TV and the HomePod to the same \"room\" in the Home app on your iPhone to make this feature work.\n\nThe good news is that this setup is a one-time headache, and once it's done, it works without much trouble.\n\nIf you have more than one HomePod of the same type, you can and should try using them for multi-room audio. Three HomePods (or HomePod Minis) are good enough to cover an apartment of around 1000 sqft, and you can use them to have music playing in every room as you go about your day. If you have a Mac, you could also get the excellent SoundSource app to test how much you like multi-room audio without having to buy multiple HomePods first, too. SoundSource lets you send audio to multiple devices at once, which means that you can play the same audio file on generic Bluetooth speakers, HomePods, AirPods, and any other audio devices connected to your Mac, at the same time.\n\nYou can use this to get a feel for how multi-room audio sounds, and if you like the experience, you can use multiple HomePods to have the same experience with minimal latency.\n\nYou can use your HomePod to send voice messages to other people in your house. For instance, you can send the following command to Siri: \"Intercom, it's time for dinner.\" This will send your dinner reminder message to all HomePods in the house. Others can use Siri to reply to you as well, making it an effective alternative to sending texts.\n\nYou can access the intercom function by opening the Home app on your iPhone, holding down the HomePod icon, and selecting Accessory Settings > Intercom. It also works with Siri on your iPhone, so you can send an intercom message to a HomePod even when it's not nearby.\n\nApple's HomeKit smart home platform may not be as popular as its competition, but there are some good HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories out there. If you find the right products, you can use the HomePod to control your entire house. This includes lights, doors, cameras, and many other types of smart home gadgets. Of course, all of these features are heavily dependent on Siri, which means that you'll occasionally have to repeat your commands or deal with the wrong gadget being switched on or off.\n\nAlthough Siri can be frustrating to deal with, HomeKit is the best option for people who want a privacy-focused smart home platform. Apple tries its best to minimize data sent to external servers and encrypts security footage, which is different from the approach many competing platforms have chosen.\n\nIn my experience, it's worth it to take some time to figure out the best place to put your HomePod, particularly for the best stereo output. Apple recommends placing your HomePod up to 10 inches away from a wall, but in my experience, it works best if it's about 6-10 inches from walls. For the best stereo experience, you should place your two HomePods on either side of your TV, not more than 4 feet from each other.\n\nIf you have expensive wood furniture, be sure to check if it's safe to place the HomePod on those surfaces. Sometimes, HomePods can leave a mark on wooden surfaces, so you can consider using a cork trivet to protect the surface.\n\nIf you've previously enabled sharing analytics data with Apple, your HomePod could be sending audio of your Siri interactions to Apple's servers. You should review this and disable the feature if you don't want to share this data. Open the Home app on your iPhone, hold the HomePod icon, and go to Accessory Settings. Now, go to Analytics & Improvements and disable all options on this page. On the Accessory Settings page, you can also go to Siri History and select Delete Siri History to clear out previously stored data.\n\nThe HomePod also supports automation routines, and you can use these to do lots of fun things. For about a year, I'd set up my HomePod to play calming music in the mornings and some jazz at sunset. You can set these up in Apple's Shortcuts app. Go to the Automation section, tap the + button, and select Create Home Automation. This is where you can set up your favorite automation routines. The HomePod supports executing actions when you reach or leave your home, at a specific time of the day, when accessories are connected, or when a sensor detects something (eg: motion).",

    "description": "8BitDo unveiled the next generation of its flagship Ultimate controller series at CES 2026--and it now makes sense why the manufacturer hasn't released an Xbox version of the Ultimate 2. Officially licensed by Xbox, the 8BitDo Ultimate 3E is a wireless modular controller for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Apple devices, and Android. A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own Elite Series 2 and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Scuf Valor Pro, and GameSir G7 Pro.",

    "description": "Apple needs big news in 2026, and it's expected to deliver launches like a foldable iPhone.",
    "fullText": "Apple is famously tight-lipped about what it's working on. However, occasionally the tech giant gives hints about what's coming.\n\nIt's pointed to big changes coming to its voice assistant Siri, for example.\n\n2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Apple, which is expected to release a foldable iPhone and upgrade its AI, Apple Intelligence, a technology that CEO Tim Cook has struggled to establish as a household name.\n\n\"Many will point to AI as Cook's Achilles' heel — and that critique is not misplaced, though not for lack of early ambition. The shortfall lies in execution,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider.\n\nThe company typically makes big product announcements in June at its Worldwide Developers Conference and in the fall, when it tends to debut a new iPhone generation. It also sprinkles in other product launches throughout the year, such as new iPads or Mac computers.\n\nHere's what tech analysts, insiders, and Apple itself have said to expect from the tech giant in 2026.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple's Services business, which encompasses its subscription-based offerings, has experienced steady growth across several earnings periods. It makes sense that this is an area where Apple would want to continue innovating.\n\nOn January 2, the tech giant released an update to its Apple Fitness+ service, which it teased heading into the new year.\n\nThe features include new workout programs, an Artist Spotlight that features exercise playlists dedicated to specific artists, and new additions to its Time to Walk program, which pairs storytelling with music for people to listen to while walking.\n\nApple first teased an updated AI-powered Siri at WWDC 2024 in a now-deleted clip where actor Bella Ramsey asks Siri to remind them about the name of someone they'd had dinner with in the past. In the clip, Siri was able to recall the name based on the prior context of texts and the calendar.\n\nWhen Apple Intelligence came out in fall 2024, that version of Siri was missing. In March 2025, Apple made the rare move of delaying its launch, saying it'll be released \"in the coming year.\"\n\nApple confirmed to Tom's Guide in June 2025 that the new Siri would come in 2026.\n\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, known for his Apple predictions and supply-chain sourcing, said in a note in 2025 that he expects Apple to introduce the first foldable iPhone in 2026 with a retail price of over $2,000.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman reported a similar timeline and price point for the launch of a foldable iPhone.\n\nCompetitors like Samsung and Chinese phone maker Huawei have been on the foldable phones trend for years, so Apple won't be the first to innovate its product lineup this way.\n\nAs it stands, foldable phones have a relatively \"small base\" in the smartphone market, Chatterjee told Business Insider in August 2025. Apple, however, has the market share to make the form factor mainstream among smartphone owners.\n\n\"Apple will, like it has done before in the smartwatch business, where Samsung moved first, be a catalyst for growth in the category,\" Chatterjee said.\n\nApple analyst Kuo published a note in June 2025 on a more affordable 13-inch MacBook, which Bloomberg reported could cost less than the $999 MacBook Air, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nIt would be the first MacBook to run on a chip built for an iPhone, Kuo said. Kuo predicted mass production would begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026.",

You are then asked whether you bought something at an electrical retailer recently for £120 and spent £235 in Birmingham, but neither transaction rings true.\n\nThe caller tells you they have blocked the payments but they must now secure your account, and say they will send you a notification to approve, or a code to pass on to them. You feel under pressure to protect your money, so you do what is asked.\n\nUnfortunately, the person at the other end of the phone is not your bank but a criminal, and they have added your payment card to a digital wallet on one of their many smartphones. At some stage, your account will be emptied by purchases of expensive phones or designer clothes, which will then be sold on.\n\nBanks have seen an increase in the number of attempts to exploit victims using the elaborate digital wallet fraud and have introduced new security measures to counter the threat.\n\nDanai Antoniou, the chief scientist at Gradient Labs, a financial services AI company, says the approach from criminals can appear harmless as the victim is not being asked to move money.\n\n“This is why most people don’t question it. If the notification says ‘never share this with anyone’ (or similar), they will pre-emptively mention it to the customer that this is a routine comment that comes with every notification – which is true, customers do become immune to warnings if they get warnings frequently,” she says.\n\n“Victims often describe feeling panicked and pressured during the call, being told their account is under attack, or that their money is at risk. In that heightened emotional state, approving a notification feels like the responsible thing to do. The victim believes they’re protecting their account, when, in reality, they’re handing over the keys.”\n\nSantander says that digital wallet fraud was the second biggest reason for card scam losses last year, while HSBC has reported an increase over the past 18 months.\n\nUK Finance, the banking trade body, says that the number of attempts has surged, in part because security systems have prevented criminals being successful, forcing them to make more attacks.\n\nThe fraud can start with phishing where the victim provides personal and bank details after a text message that promises, for example, a winter fuel allowance payment, or an offer for cheap products on social media.\n\nAfter a few weeks, enough time for the victim to forget about supplying details, the fraudster will contact them, claiming to be from their bank. They will know which bank because of the details already supplied by the victim.\n\nThey may ask the victim to confirm the address, or postcode, they have on file, in order to portray legitimacy. The criminal will then ask about some transactions, all fabricated, and when the victim says they don’t recognise them, the criminal will claim they have been stopped, and more measures must be taken to secure the account. They will say that a notification is on the way, and the victim should approve it to secure the account.\n\n“The notification the customer receives is entirely legitimate, as it’s the genuine notification your bank sends when a new Apple Pay or Google Pay card is being added to a device, or the bank may send you a code via text, or in the app. They have just added your card into their Apple Pay or Google Pay and you are now receiving a text, or a notification, to approve it,” Antoniou says.\n\nFrom there, the criminals can act quickly and empty the account of the victim. “They drain accounts at high-value merchants, such as tech stores and fashion retailers. The appeal is simple: electronics and designer goods can be quickly resold on the secondary market with minimal loss of profit during the money-laundering process,” she adds.\n\nBanks don’t need your help to protect your account: they have systems in place to freeze and block accounts if needed. “Never trust anyone who calls you from your bank unless you arranged that phone call in advance. If somebody calls, tell them you will call the bank back yourself,” Antoniou says. And don’t use a number they give you: search on the web for the bank’s phone number, or use the one on the back of your physical debit or credit card.\n\nNationwide warns people to be aware of what any one-time passcodes they receive are being used for.\n\nHSBC says it has put in new security measures to counter the threat of wallet fraud and more would be coming this year. “We are regularly reminding customers not to give out their details, such as one-time passcodes, and to treat them as carefully as you would your pin,” it adds.\n\nUK Finance says: “Set up bank alerts in your app, and check your transactions regularly so you know about any suspicious transactions as soon as possible.\n\n“If you think you’ve fallen for a scam it’s important to contact your bank immediately and report it to Report Fraud.”\n\nApple says it is not responsible for approving a card for inclusion in the wallet, but that it gives banks information that they can use to combat fraud.\n\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "Company had hoped the virtual reality device would herald a new era in ‘spatial computing’\n\nPoor sales have reportedly forced Apple to cut production of the Vision Pro headset that it had hoped would herald a new era in “spatial computing”.\n\nThe tech company also reduced marketing for Vision Pro by more than 95% last year, according to the market intelligence group Sensor Tower in figures first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nApple continues to sell iPhones, iPads and laptops in the millions each quarter, but analysts say sales of Vision Pro headsets, which cost at least £3,199 ($3,499) each, have been sluggish.\n\nApple has not released sales figures for the device, but the market research group International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates it will have sold only 45,000 in the last quarter of last year.\n\nIDC said Apple’s Chinese producer, Luxshare, had stopped production of the headset at the start of 2025, and Apple has not expanded direct sales beyond a select 13 countries.\n\nCounterpoint Research has predicted a 14% reduction in annual sales of virtual reality headsets.\n\nThe apparent failure of Vision Pro has echoes of the ill-fated Google Glass in 2013. Users were shunned as social pariahs or “glassholes”.\n\nDespite these setbacks tech firms are persisting with smart glasses. Apple is expected to release a cheaper version of Vision Pro later this year, but the emphasis now is on AI-enabled devices.\n\nReports in the tech press said Apple had paused its planned next iteration of virtual reality in favour of wearable AI devices. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is also expected to cut back on its plans for a “metaverse”, which includes its virtual reality Quest headsets. These are less advanced than Apple’s product but at £419 each are considerably cheaper and have cornered 80% of the market.\n\nMeta confirmed last month that it was “shifting some of our investments from metaverse towards AI glasses and other wearables”.\n\nApple has refused to comment on the reports that it is scaling back virtual reality headsets.\n\nIf confirmed, the cuts to Vision Pro would represent a rare commercial flop for an Apple product.\n\nWhen it launched Vision Pro in 2023, Apple hoped the devices, which allow users to interact with apps using eye movements, would have the same success as Macs and iPhones. At the product launch Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “Your surroundings become an infinite canvas … Vision Pro blends digital content into the space around us. It will introduce us to spatial computing.”\n\nBut consumers balked at the price tag and reviewers complained that the devices were heavy, uncomfortable and little more than a gimmick. There was also alarm when users were filmed wearing the headsets while driving.\n\nEven enthusiasts admit the headsets only have niche appeal and that the experience of wearing them can be isolating from other people.\n\nThe limited number of apps available compared with phones and tablets is also thought to have limited interest in Vision Pro.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s tech analyst Erik Woodring summed up its problems. “We can say the cost, form factor and the lack of VisionOS native apps are the reasons why the Vision Pro never sold broadly,” he told the FT.\n\nApple says there are 3,000 apps available for Vision Pro headsets. That is a relatively small number compared with the proliferation after the launch of the iPhone in 2007.",

The changes could arrive as soon as January, according to the video.\n\n\"Word on the street is that Apple Fitness+ has big plans for 2026... stay tuned!\" the caption reads.\n\nA post shared by Apple Fitness+ (@applefitnessplus)\n\nThe ad featured Apple Fitness+ trainers Bakari Williams, Molly Fox, and Dice Iida-Klein holding newspapers with headlines that suggested major changes. Although Apple didn't share details of what's to come in 2026, some commenters shared what they want to see and speculated on what could be coming.\n\nSome Instagram users commented asking Apple to make small updates, such as reducing the music in workout videos or adding the ability to skip back and forth between workouts. Others asked for more programs to choose from.\n\nApple Fitness+ is a subscription-based digital fitness platform that includes instructor-led classes, on-demand workout videos, and health and fitness metrics. It competes with similar offerings from companies like Peloton. Apple Fitness+ launched in 2020, and Apple expanded it into 28 new markets in December. It costs $9.99 a month or $79.99 annually in the US.\n\nAlthough Apple doesn't report how many users pay for Apple Fitness+, its Services division, which includes those subscribers, hit an all-time high in revenue during its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nApple has also teased other major product reveals coming in 2026, including an upgrade to its virtual assistant Siri.\n\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary learned about the \"signal and noise\" ratio for productivity from Apple founder Steve Jobs.",
    "fullText": "\"Shark Tank\" star Kevin O'Leary has learned many things from the CEOs and world leaders he rubs shoulders with, but one of his most important daily rituals comes from an iconic innovator: Steve Jobs.\n\nO'Leary told Business Insider that a goal technique he uses every day came straight from studying the Apple founder. He picked it up after working alongside Jobs in the mid-1990s, when O'Leary's educational software company The Learning Company was working with Apple to get the Mac computer into schools.\n\n\"He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day,\" O'Leary said of Jobs.\n\n\"You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise — whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done,\" he continued. \"So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\"\n\nO'Leary said one of the three things he has to do every day is exercise. He usually wakes up at 5 a.m. and works out for over an hour, usually biking about 12 miles.\n\n\"I have to do that; otherwise, bad things happen,\" he said.\n\nOn the noise side, part of the 30% that gets in O'Leary's way is his overflowing inbox. It's become such a distraction that he's stopped trying to keep up with email.\n\n\"I don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day,\" O'Leary said. \"I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try.\"\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" star says in his line of work, it's best to focus on what he really wants to accomplish and block out all the noise.\n\n\"In entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist,\" O'Leary said. \"It's what you want to do with your time.\"",

    "fullText": "ESPN analyst calls for Giants to draft Fernando Mendoza or Dante Moore over building up Jaxson Dart originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer Alabama quarterback and ESPN analyst Greg McElroy believes the New York Giants should consider a pivot at quarterback. Even after spending a first-round pick on Jaxson Dart just one year ago, is it time to move on?\n\nDuring Tuesday's episode of Get Up, McElroy said he would prioritize the long-term upside of college quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore rather than committing fully to Dart.\n\n“Right now, I would go with the upside that you get with Dante Moore and Fernando Mendoza,” McElroy said. He called Dart a “high-floor prospect” with mechanical inconsistencies that may limit his ceiling.\n\nThe Giants selected Dart with the No. 25 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. After beginning the season behind Russell Wilson, Dart took over as the starter in Week 4 and has shown flashes, particularly as a dual-threat runner. In Sunday’s win over the Las Vegas Raiders, Dart completed 22 of 30 passes for 207 yards and added 48 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBut McElroy raised concerns about Dart’s durability and processing speed, noting his physical style has already resulted in a concussion. He questioned whether Dart can elevate those around him, as he did at Ole Miss, or whether he needs an elite supporting cast.\n\nMcElroy compared Dart’s path to quarterbacks such as Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts, while maintaining Mendoza and Moore offer greater long-term upside.\n\nWith New York potentially drafting near the top in 2026, McElroy’s comments add to a growing debate over the Giants’ future at quarterback. Obviously, there will need to be a conversation with a new head coach coming in soon.\n\nMichigan’s Biff Poggi warns up to 25 players may not return after Christmas break\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nESPN's grade for LSU hiring Lane Kiffin will make Ole Miss fans even more mad\n\nWhy Diego Pavia attorneys are fighting the NCAA for seventh year of eligibility",

    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

    "description": "The YouTuber doesn't seem fazed by Apple's threats.",
    "fullText": "There are a few people that Apple would love to delete from the face of the planet.\n\nBloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who’s consistently divulging Apple’s plans, is one. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is always sharing information based on his supply chain checks, is high up on the list, too. But YouTuber Jon Prosser is public enemy number one that Apple is trying to truly silence. And for good reason: the man who Apple sued in July for leaking iOS 26 and Liquid Glass keeps spoiling Apple’s unreleased products with high-quality 3D renders in his videos—like the foldable iPhone that’s not expected to be announced until next year.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Prosser gave the world an early gift: a video revealing what he claims is Apple’s foldable iPhone in all of its book-style glory. Watch for yourself:\n\nIn his video, Prosser confidently states the foldable iPhone, which is rumored to launch next fall alongside the iPhone 18 Pro and 18 Pro Max, will have a 5.5-inch external display with a hole-punch camera. The inside foldable screen will measure 7.8 inches with a hole-punch camera in the upper left corner. His renders show dual cameras sitting on an oblong camera plateau much like the one on the iPhone Air; an LED flash sits on the opposite side.\n\nProsser says the foldable iPhone will be 9mm thick when closed, which means each half will likely be 4.5mm. That’d over a whole millimeter thinner than the 5.6mm iPhone Air, which is already barely thicker than a USB-C port and feels impossibly thin in the hand.\n\nThe dimensions do align with the rumored footprint from multiple previous reports. However, it conflicts with a recent leak that claimed the foldable iPhone would have an external screen that’s about 5.25 inches, which would be smaller than the 5.4-inch iPhone 13 mini.\n\nProsser’s 3D renders do appear to depict a foldable iPhone that’s wider than it is tall when folded and open. Side-by-side with a first-gen Pixel Fold, minus the thicker bezels on Google’s foldable, the foldable iPhone might look similar, down to the location of the hole-punch cameras. Other reports have suggested the foldable iPhone would have an “invisible” under-panel camera (UDC) in the folding display.\n\nThe big question will be whether or not Apple can make the crease less visible. Several previous reports said that Apple had figured it out, but the latest leak suggests that might not be the case after all.\n\nUltimately, a foldable iPhone will undoubtedly get lots of buzz if Apple does launch it next year. But the real indicator of its success will be whether consumers buy it. The iPhone Air is a state-of-the-art phone with impressive miniaturization that could be a glimpse of what’s to come in a future pair of Apple smart glasses, and yet it’s reportedly been a commercial failure. It’s been such a sales flop that there may not be an iPhone Air 2 next year. More consumers have purchased the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros than the super-skinny iPhone Air that has fewer cameras and less battery life.\n\nWill consumers see the value of a foldable iPhone, especially if it comes with an exorbitant price tag that could start at over $2,000? I’d say never bet against the iPhone, but then again, the iPhone mini, iPhone Plus, and now the iPhone Air reportedly didn’t sell enough.",

    "description": "Apple, Michigan taxpayers, and one of Detroit’s wealthiest families spent roughly $30 million training hundreds of people to build iPhone apps. Not everyone lands coding jobs right away.",
    "fullText": "Lizmary Fernandez took a detour from studying to be an immigration attorney to join a free Apple course for making iPhone apps. The Apple Developer Academy in Detroit launched as part of the company’s $200 million response to the Black Lives Matter protests and aims to expand opportunities for people of color in the country’s poorest big city.\n\nBut Fernandez found the program’s cost-of-living stipend lacking—“A lot of us got on food stamps,” she says—and the coursework insufficient for landing a coding job. “I didn’t have the experience or portfolio,” says the 25-year-old, who is now a flight attendant and preparing to apply to law school. “Coding is not something I got back to.”\n\nSince 2021, the academy has welcomed over 1,700 students, a racially diverse mix with varying levels of tech literacy and financial flexibility. About 600 students, including Fernandez, have completed its 10-month course of half-days at Michigan State University, which cosponsors the Apple-branded and Apple-focused program.\n\nWIRED reviewed contracts and budgets and spoke with officials and graduates for the first in-depth examination of the nearly $30 million invested in the academy over the past four years—almost 30 percent of which came from Michigan taxpayers and the university’s regular students. As tech giants begin pouring billions of dollars into AI-related job training courses across the country, the Apple academy offers lessons on the challenges of uplifting diverse communities.\n\nSeven graduates who spoke with WIRED said they had good experiences at the academy, citing benefits such as receiving mentorship from past students. Fernandez says she was impressed by a focus on developing inclusive apps and a series of speakers from Apple who were genuinely willing to help and share frank lessons. “Their heart was in the right place,” she says.\n\nThe program does expose people of color to new possibilities. “It changed my life,” says Min Thu Khine, who’s now mentoring coding students and working at an Apple Store Genius Bar. “My dream is to be a software engineer at Apple.”\n\nThe academy also draws positive grades from some researchers who study tech education, such as Quinn Burke. He says its fully subsidized in-person instruction surpasses the quality of many coding boot camps, which proliferated over the past decade and sometimes left students in debt and with narrow skills.\n\nBut the academy being open to all can complicate instruction and how to measure success. One entire family attended together, and at least two mothers have come with their daughters. Students on average are in their thirties, ranging from 18-year-olds to, for example, a grandfather in his seventies who wanted to develop a photo app for his grandchild, according to Sarah Gretter, the academy leader for Michigan State.",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook bought $3 million in Nike shares, nearly doubling his stake in the company.",
    "fullText": "Nike has Tim Cook to thank for its warm, festive glow this Christmas.\n\nThe sneaker giant disclosed in a filing that Cook, a longtime member of Nike's board and its lead independent director, bought shares in Nike worth about $3 million.\n\nCook's purchase of 50,000 shares almost doubled his holdings in the company to just over 105,000 shares, or about $6 million.\n\nNike's stock jumped 4.64% at the close of trading on Wednesday.\n\nCook's investment sends a signal of support to Nike CEO Elliott Hill, who is in the middle of a plan to turn around the struggling sportswear giant.\n\n\"You buy with your own personal wealth, you put your money where your mouth is, you're making a point,\" said Simeon Siegel, equities research analyst at Guggenheim, in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday. \"Whether it's intended as an investment or as a signal, it's there.\"\n\nThe company also disclosed that another board member, Robert Swan, the chair of its audit committee, bought shares worth about $500,000 this week.\n\nHill rejoined Nike as CEO in October last year, inheriting a company facing heightened competition from smaller players. Nike was also trying to regain its mojo after its attempt to sell directly to consumers instead of through marketplace retailers stumbled. The company had also become, in Hill's words, \"far too promotional.\"\n\nHill's \"win now\" strategy involves focusing on five key areas: culture, product, marketing, marketplace, and in-person presence. The plan has reset the company's focus on sports, including running, basketball, football, and training. Nike's management team has undergone a revamp, with several key leaders receiving promotions.\n\nNike's road to recovery under Hill has been hit with obstacles. The company's shares tumbled last week after it reported a big drop in sales in China during its second-quarter earnings. Nike's profits have also been hit by tariffs this year, which the company has said it hopes to offset by raising prices for customers in the US. Nike's stock is down 18.5% in the year-to-date.\n\nCook has been a member of Nike's board of directors since 2005. Apple and Nike have often collaborated on products over the years, including fitness apps and Nike variations of the Apple Watch.\n\nCook isn't just an Apple investor — he's also shown his support for Nike on his feet. Earlier this year, Cook was spotted wearing a pair of custom Nike Vomero Plus sneakers at the reopening of an Apple store in Tokyo. The kicks were designed by Sashiko Gals, an artisan division of the Japanese brand Kuon, the designers told Business Insider's Jordan Hart. Cook also wore a different pair of one-of-a-kind Nike sneakers when he launched a new iPad lineup at an Apple event in 2024.",

    "description": "Apple's 2025 helped set up its future.",
    "fullText": "It’s been quite a year for Apple (AAPL). The company reported record revenue on the back of strong iPhone sales. Its Services business continued its impressive growth, hitting $109.2 billion in sales. And its market capitalization topped $4 trillion, joining Nvidia (NVDA) as just the second company to reach the milestone.\n\nBut the company is also contending with major changes amid its executive ranks. CFO Jeff Williams retired — he was previously considered the top choice to take up the mantle of CEO after Tim Cook eventually steps down.\n\nHead of government affairs Lisa Jackson and general counsel Kate Adams are retiring in late January and late 2026, respectively.\n\nAnd then there's AI chief John Giannandrea and design vice president Alan Dye. Giannandrea is retiring and turning Apple's AI efforts over to Amar Subramanya, who previously worked on AI initiatives at Google (GOOGL, GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nDye, meanwhile, left Apple to lead Meta (META) Reality Labs' new design studio.\n\nAll of this comes as Cook is reportedly preparing senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus to take over as CEO when he departs.\n\nIt all adds up to an Apple in flux as it transforms itself for a post-Cook era. According to the Financial Times, Cook could step down as soon as early 2026. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, meanwhile, said there’s still no firm timeline for when Cook will leave his post.\n\nRegardless of exact timing, Apple will eventually have to say goodbye to Cook, and 2025 helped the company set itself up for its biggest change in years.\n\nCook, who joined Apple in 1998, took over as CEO 14 years ago following the death of founder Steve Jobs. Jobs turned around an ailing Apple when he returned to the company in 1997 after being fired in 1985. He subsequently released a string of groundbreaking products, including the iPod and iPhone, which continues to bring in the majority of Apple's revenue.\n\nCook has carried that success forward during his time at the company's helm, overseeing the debut of the Apple Watch and AirPods, as well as the explosion of Apple's Services business. He has also pushed Apple to use its own chips in its products, giving the company more control over the design and functionality of its devices.\n\nThat, coupled with Cook's deft abilities as a negotiator, helped Apple weather a series of crises, including showdowns with the US Department of Justice, the COVID-19 pandemic, and President Trump's ongoing trade war with China. Trump eventually exempted smartphones and certain other tech products from his tariffs on Chinese goods.",

    "fullText": "Getting a new phone is a great way to start the new year, especially if it's one of Apple's latest iPhone models. But why get an upgrade for just yourself when you can upgrade the entire family in one go? T-Mobile's current holiday deal makes it worthwhile by handing out four free iPhone 17s when you open four new lines on its Essentials 4 Line Plan.\n\nT-Mobile's Essentials Plan is already one of the best cell phone plans we've ever tested for those looking to open multiple lines on a budget, so we highly recommend it at any time. But with four free iPhones to sweeten the deal, it's a particularly good time to switch.\n\nNot only does T-Mobile's current deal get you a suite of the most sophisticated iPhones yet for free, but it also gets you an excellent service plan. Compared to other major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, T-Mobile's phone plans offer the best value for their quality, especially if you're opening multiple lines, like in this promotion.\n\nFor more on plan offerings, coverage, and speeds, check out our full T-Mobile review.\n\nIt's worth noting that you won't be getting the four phones for free up front. You'll earn back the cost of the devices via 24 monthly billing credits, which means you'll be locked into a two-year contract with T-Mobile before the phones are officially paid off. You'll also have to pay a $35 activation fee for each device. Still, this is less of a commitment compared to other carriers, which typically lock you into a 36-month contract for this type of deal. It's certainly a small price to pay for upgrades for the whole family.\n\nIf you don't need a new phone, you can still upgrade to T-Mobile's network. The carrier is also running a promotion that gets new customers up to $800 back when they keep their current phone and switch to T-Mobile from another carrier. Learn \n\nThe terms and conditions can be hard to follow for these phone carrier deals, so we're breaking down exactly how to get your free phones. Here are the steps to follow.\n\nT-Mobile's four free iPhone 17s promotion isn't the only one the carrier is running ahead of the holidays. If you're on the hunt for a Samsung or Google smartphone, a different iPhone model, a smartwatch, or even a tablet, there's a deal for you. Explore some of T-Mobile's current promotions below.",

    "description": "The free tier includes everything except Bevel Intelligence.",
    "fullText": "The makers of Bevel, a health app for the Apple Watch that turns the device into a Whoop-style fitness tracker, have announced on social media that nearly all of the app’s functions will soon be available for free. Until now, Bevel required a $5.99/month (or $49.99/year) subscription. That said, the paid tier isn't going away completely.\n\nYou can read my review of Bevel here, but in brief, it’s a tracking app that uses data from your Apple Watch (and other devices) to give you a Whoop-style dashboard that collects your health data in one place and analyzes it. Bevel can give you advice about how recovered it thinks you are, and how your habits affect your health metrics. While the Apple Watch can collect a lot of data, Apple has never built an app that integrates everything in a friendly, easily readable way.\n\nThat integrated dashboard is where Apple Watch competitors like Whoop and Oura shine, and using Bevel (or one of its competitors, like Athlytic) gives a similar experience.\n\nAccording to announcements Bevel made on Instagram and Reddit, an update rolling out this week makes all features of Bevel free except Bevel Intelligence, their AI feature. The company says this is because AI is more expensive for it to provide. Free features include everything else: “all historical data, Nutrition, Strength Builder, Sleep Alarm, and much more.”\n\nThe company also hinted that two things are likely coming in 2026: more features (specifics not yet announced) and a price hike. Customers who currently \n\nThere’s not enough information to know whether next year’s plans, which the company is calling “Bevel 3.0,” will be worth the subscription fee, whatever it happens to be. But I can say that the features of regular Bevel are definitely worth a try, especially at no cost. Bevel collects data from almost any health app that links to Apple Health, and can track a multitude of metrics, including strength training by muscle group, cardio load, recovery scores, and habit tracking. Most other wearables collect this information in their own apps, but if you wear an Apple Watch, Bevel is one of the best ways to consolidate it all.",

    "fullText": "Looking for a new iPhone or a good deal on a refurbished one? Samuel Gibbs has tested and rated Apple’s smartphones, including the new iPhone 17\n\nHow to make your smartphone last longer\n\nThe best iPhone may be the one you already own. There’s generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.\n\nMany other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancy switching to Android, there are still a few choices to make. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release of the cheaper iPhone 16e and super-thin iPhone Air.\n\nWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us evaluate a phone, measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.\n\nWe use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.\n\nThe findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nBest iPhone for most people:\n\n iPhone 17\n\nBest iPhone for camera:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro\n\nBest iPhone for battery:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro Max\n\nBest thin and light iPhone:\n\n iPhone Air\n\nCheapest new iPhone:\n\n iPhone 16e\n\nThe base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation.\n\nWhile it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now.\n\nThe rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons.\n\nSporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top.\n\nA new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation.\n\nThe iPhone 17 runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition.\n\nThe biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package.\n\nBuy if: you want a great iPhone experience \nDon’t buy if: you want optical zoom on your camera or a new design\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 review: the Apple smartphone to get this year\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19\nStorage: 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP main+UW; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH)\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple.\n\nIt shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable.\n\nHousing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThis is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.\n\nBuy if: you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge display\nDon’t buy if: you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhone\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoom\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH)\nWeight: 204g\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back.\n\nDesign-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making.\n\nStandout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up.\n\nThe result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using a Popsocket, handle, lanyard or other strap to help keep hold of it.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nApple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro.\n\nBuy if: you want super-long battery life and a massive screen \nDon’t buy if: you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper device\n\nScreen: 6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH)\nWeight: 231g\n\nThe iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides.\n\nIt weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up.\n\nOn the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features.\n\nThe super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones.\n\nSecond, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers.\n\nHowever, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight.\n\nBuy if: you want thinness above all else \nDon’t buy if: you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSim\n\nRead our full iPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinness\n\nScreen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH)\nWeight: 165g\n\nThe cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, but with a more modern design and chip.\n\nIt has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from 2022’s iPhone 14. It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.\n\nInside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features.\n\nThe iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options.\n\nDespite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price.\n\nBuy if: you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple\nDon’t buy if: you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessories\n\nRead our full iPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phone\n\nScreen: 6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A18\nStorage: 128, 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 12MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH)\nWeight: 167g\n\nThe iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera. The rear camera is slightly lower grade, and storage capacity is smaller too. It was good on release and will continue to receive about five to six years of software support – but it’s fairly expensive at an RRP of £699 (128GB), so look for refurbished models or deals.\n\nIf your iPhone is running slow or the battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, there may be something you can do. Check your battery health in settings. If it’s past its best, a replacement costs £65 to £109 from Apple, or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.\n\nIf your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’s iPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receive occasional security updates from Apple.\n\nBuying refurbished phones is better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.\n\nThere are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished and sold directly by Apple that come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chains CeX and Game and online stores such as musicMagpie and Envirofone. Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay and refurb specialist Back Market also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including O2, giffgaff, EE and Vodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.\n\nThe condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:\n\nGrade A – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.\n\nGrade B – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.\n\nGrade C – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.\n\nGrade D – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:\n\nBattery health – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?\n\nCharging port – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.\n\nButtons – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.\n\nFingerprint scanner – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.\n\nNetwork locks – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.\n\nUnauthorised parts – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.\n\nCheck it isn’t stolen – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a database of stolen devices through a service such as CheckMEND or similar.\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?\n\nAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.\n\nAn iPhone 13 mini, unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.\n\nFor more, read how to make your smartphone last longer and the best phone straps\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "HarmonyOS, Huawei Technologies' self-developed operating system, has crossed the threshold of 27 million users, a sign that the company's efforts to take on Apple's iOS and Google's Android are paying off.\n\nIn announcing the user numbers for its latest iterations - HarmonyOS 5 and HarmonyOS 6 - the Shenzhen-based tech giant referred to the milestone as a \"survival line\" for the company.\n\nThe platform also boasted an ecosystem of over 10 million developers. User engagement crossed milestones, too, with more than 100,000 new devices activated on a daily basis, as well as over 88 million daily downloads and updates recorded for applications, according to the company.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe latest figures, which come six years after the company first launched the operating system to counter Washington's sanctions on its access to Android, reflected how Huawei's efforts to develop an alternative for the world's largest smartphone manufacturers were paying off.\n\nHuawei has been transitioning its own devices to the operating system since 2021, ramping up efforts after the US placed the company on its Entity List in 2019 over national security concerns. The privately held firm has since expanded HarmonyOS beyond smartphones and tablets.\n\nHuawei Pura 80 smartphones are displayed at the company's flagship store in Beijing, June 11, 2025.

Photo: Reuters>\n\nHarmonyOS 6, the latest iteration, was initially made available to developers in June and released to Chinese consumers in October. That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

    "fullText": "The world's largest technology companies are scrambling to manage a growing crisis affecting thousands of their employees on work visas, as new social media screening requirements trigger delays at US embassies and consulates worldwide.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and ServiceNow have all sent advisories to visa-holding employees in recent days, warning them against international travel and describing appointment delays stretching up to a year.\n\nThe memos, sent by immigration law firms representing these companies or by their internal legal teams, paint a picture of mounting uncertainty for foreign workers who form a critical part of the tech industry's workforce.\n\nThe warnings come as American embassies have postponed routine visa stamping appointments, leaving some employees already abroad unable to return to work in the US for extended periods.\n\nFor H-1B holders, the primary work visa used by tech companies, the situation creates a particularly difficult bind. If their visa stamp expires and they travel abroad, they must obtain a new stamp at a consulate before re-entering the US. With appointments now being rescheduled months into the future, what would typically be a routine trip home has become a potential career disruption lasting up to a year.\n\nOn Friday, a spokesperson for the Department of State told Business Insider it was now conducting \"online presence reviews for applicants.\" The department said it may move appointments as resources change, with applicants able to request expedited slots on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"While in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritizing thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else,\" the State Department spokesperson said. Appointments in Ireland and Vietnam have also been postponed, according to immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC.\n\nBelow are the full texts of the internal memos sent to employees at these companies, obtained by Business Insider, which reveal how corporate America is responding to the visa processing slowdown.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft declined to comment, while Apple and ServiceNow did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBelow is the text of a memo sent by Jack Chen, Microsoft's associate general counsel for immigration.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP (BAL), the immigration firm that represents Google.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by Apple's immigration team.\n\nBelow is the text of an email sent by ServiceNow's Global Mobility Team.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple Watch User Should Know",
    "description": "The Apple Watch isn't just about notifications and workouts.",
    "fullText": "The Apple Watch is both a companion to the iPhone, as well as a very capable device in its own right. Out of the box, it offers notification mirroring, so you feel every alert on your iPhone on your wrist, as well as workout tracking, so you can keep up with your fitness goals. But this wearable can be so much more than that. In fact, it doesn't take much to make your Apple Watch more personal and efficient. If you own one, here are ten hacks you need to know about:\n\nGet your notifications under control. By default, Apple likes to forward every single alert from iPhone to your watch. That’s just a recipe for distraction. You should turn off most of these alerts, and only keep the most important notifications. An important message from Slack or a text from a close friend is worth the distraction; a promotion from Uber is not. Open the Watch app on your iPhone, go to Notifications, scroll down and disable most of the apps that mirror alerts from the iPhone.\n\nWhile you’re at it, it might help to keep your Watch in Silent mode at all times. Open the Control Center by pressing the Side button and tap the Bell icon to quiet your watch for good.\n\nThe Apple Watch's recent wrist gestures have turned out to be a sleeper hit for me. What I thought would be a gimmick is something I use multiple times a day now. If you have an Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2, SE 3, or higher, you get access to two gestures: Double Tap and Wrist Flick. First, if you tap your index finger and your thumb twice in the air, you’ll perform the major action current on-screen. This could include answering a call, stopping a timer, or stopping a workout. I use this all the time now, even when I don’t have my hands full. Second, you can flick your wrist up to go back a screen on your watch. This is a simple way to get back from menus, or to go back to the watch face, without actually tapping the screen.\n\nThis is a feature I've been using for years, but since it's buried quite deep in settings, many users don't know about it. Once set up, you can unlock your Mac automatically as long as you’re wearing your Apple Watch. It doesn’t even have to be on the same wifi network, so this works when you’re out and about.\n\nTo set this up, go to System Settings on your Mac, then choose Touch ID & Password. In the Apple Watch section, simply turn on the sync feature for your Apple Watch. Once you authenticate with your Mac password, you’ll be good to go. The next time you lift the lid on your Mac, macOS will automatically sign you in.\n\nI used to love customizing my watch face with all the various complications for timers, shortcuts, and, weather, just to name a few. But I was never really satisfied with how cluttered things looked when it was all set up. That changed once I embraced the Photos watch face, and moved all the contextual information and shortcuts to widgets. Keeping all those functions and data points in a collapsable stack of widgets, rather than all on screen at once, looks so much better.\n\nTo try this out for yourself, scroll using the Crown or swipe up on the watch face to access your widgets. Go to the bottom and tap the Edit button to start customizing your widget stack. You can add three app shortcuts to the top widget. I usually save this for workouts, battery, and the quick timer. Then, I have dedicated widgets for my Activity Rings, Weather, Shortcuts, Sleep, and more. You can pin widgets in the order that you want, and watchOS will also automatically suggest relevant widgets depending on your usage. Dive in deeper with our detailed guide on customizing widgets.\n\nOnce you move your app interactions to widgets, your watch faces suddenly open up. Take some time to create and customize two to three watch faces that you can switch between as you wish. It's easy to do at any time: just swipe in from the left or the right edge to change the watch face.\n\nCreating and customizing watch faces is actually easier on the Watch app on the iPhone. In fact, it’s the only place where you can set up my favorite watch face: the Photos watch face. This watch face cycles between the photos of my wife, nature, and urban landscapes, showing me a fresh selection each day. I love this watch face quite a lot. You can also create a watch face for fitness tracking and fitness modes, and a simple watch face for regular use. (My favorites here are Typograph and Meridian watch faces.)\n\nFor almost a decade, you couldn’t edit your Activity Rings. If you got sick, or just wanted to take an easy day, you’d lose your fitness streak. This, of course, isn’t the healthiest approach to fitness—for that, you should check out the Gentler Streak app. However, since last year's watchOS 11, you’ve had the option to pause or change your Activity Rings. You can do this from the Fitness app on iPhone, which is slightly easier than using the Apple Watch itself. From the Fitness app, tap Activity Rings, then scroll down, where you'll see Change Goals and Pause Rings. Choose the relevant option to get started. I have detailed instructions in my guide as well.\n\nIf you use an Apple TV, you know how easy it is to lose the remote. You might be familiar with the Apple TV’s remote control feature on the iPhone, but that same feature exists on the Apple Watch as well. You’ll have to find the Remote app from the app list, then choose your Apple TV. It should appear as long as it's on the same network as your watch, and nearby. From here, you can use swipe gestures and buttons to control playback on your TV.\n\nOn the Apple Watch, silent mode and alarm sound levels are married to each other, unlike on the iPhone. But recently, Apple added a feature where you can break-through silent mode for a particular alarm—it's just not enabled by default for all alarms. To set it up, open an alarm from the Alarms app, go to the Edit Alarm menu, scroll down, and enable Break Through Silent Mode.\n\nFocuses on the iPhone are supremely powerful, and underrated. And things get a lot more interesting when you add Apple Watch to the mix. Each Focus can have its own watch face associated with it, so you can have a different watch face for your work Focus, another one for your personal Focus, and a fitness watch face for your workout Focus. Go to Settings > Focus to customize or create any Focus.\n\nYour Apple Watch comes with a built-in sleep tracker. To use it, you can either go to the Sleep app on Apple Watch, and create a sleep schedule, or simply switch to the Sleep Focus. When you’re in sleep mode, your watch automatically goes dark and silent, so you won't be bothered by any notifications.\n\nWith watchOS 26, your Apple Watch now also gives you a sleep score, which offers more insights into your sleeping habits. I’ve been using the Sleep mode this past year with my Apple Watch Series 10, and I’ve gotten a lot out of the sleep tracking feature already.",

    "fullText": "I wrote earlier this week about the important security updates Apple just rolled out in its 26.2 operating system updates. Among the security fixes are two zero-day bugs affecting WebKit, the browser engine that drives Safari. According to Apple, “this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”\n\nPretty serious. There are also many other security fixes, including (as I mentioned) a major Messages privacy leak. When a serious security update comes out, users should update. It’s just the smart move.\n\nApple generally tries not to leave behind users who haven’t updated or can’t update to the latest OS version. Apple also usually offers security updates for past OS versions, and indeed, the company also released iOS 18.7.3 to address the same issues.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s an ugly catch: Numerous iPhone users have reported that if your iPhone is capable of running iOS 26 but you’re still back on iOS 18, you won’t be offered iOS 18.7.3. Instead, the only update option you’ll be given is iOS 26.2.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to avoid updating to iOS 26, from a dislike of Liquid Glass to software compatibility to a general wariness to install major updates for a while. This move effectively forces users to take the iOS 26 upgrade if they want the security updates. (iPhones not capable of running iOS 26 are offered the 18.7.3 update. iPads seem to be unaffected.)\n\nThis isn’t great. Apple shouldn’t be withholding a security update from people not willing to upgrade to the next OS version. I don’t know if this is an error, bug, or policy decision, and as of this writing, Apple hasn’t responded to my questions about this issue.\n\nSeveral users have reported to me that a workaround is to 7.3. Seems like a long way to go just to get security fixes.\n\nIn general, Apple is very good about supplying security updates to older operating systems, so all its users can stay protected. But in cases like this, users should never be forced to choose between ignoring a security update and updating to an OS version they’re not ready for.\n\nIf you appreciate articles like this one, support us by becoming a Six Colors subscriber.

    "fullText": "From celebrity endorsements to digital fatigue, the once-obsolete white wire has become a fashion statement and a quiet act of opting out\n\nWith white-wired headphones endorsed by celebrities including Lily-Rose Depp, Paul Mescal, Bella Hadid and Apple Martin, a growing number of people are breaking away from wireless listening.\n\nFor inspiration, there is the Instagram account @wireditgirls, or a Balenciaga campaign featuring the model Mona Tougaard reclining bed, wired headphones in place.\n\nDaniel Rodgers, the fashion news editor at British Vogue, is familiar with the trend. “[It says] ‘I’m very effortless. I’m very nonchalant,” he says. “It’s become a real styleable accessory.”\n\nBut in a culture where the forward march of technology is often treated as compulsory, wired headphones represent more than aesthetics. “It’s an analogue way of opting out – of both tech but also life,” says Rodgers. “They’re visible in a way that AirPods aren’t. There is a sense of ‘do not disturb’.”\n\nThat symbolism is on full display on the cover of New York magazine’s latest issue, which features celebrities riding the subway: Debbie Harry with the Geese frontman Cameron Winter, Ben Stiller with the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns and Macaulay Culkin with the SubwayTakes presenter Kareem Rahma. The real story, however, is not the star power but the shared accessory in each image: wired headphones.\n\nThe pictures were taken by Hannah La Follette Ryan, the Brooklyn-based photographer behind the Instagram account @SubwayTakes, which documents New Yorkers on public transport. She says: “I see the revival as an extension of digital fatigue. Who wants another glitchy expensive gadget to charge?”\n\nPrice is clearly part of the appeal of wired headphones – Apple’s EarPods cost £17 compared with £99 for AirPods – but nostalgia is also a factor.\n\n“We’re seeing retro tech come back,” says Tom Morgan-Freelander, the deputy editor of the technology magazine Stuff. “And as part of that, brands are starting to bring back wired headphones.”\n\nHe says some younger consumers are switching to wired for sound quality, which is typically better with cables. “Bluetooth became the norm, and there was an acceptance that, for wireless convenience, you’re going to lose a bit of quality,” he adds.\n\nThen there is the issue of tangles. While wireless headphones are stored neatly in a case, wired varieties are often found in a knot at the bottom of a bag.\n\nLa Follette Ryan suggests this is part of the appeal. “The tangle is inevitable,” she says. “Think of a headphone knot as a more user-friendly Rubik’s Cube. Relish the opportunity to slow down and solve a little puzzle.”\n\nIf wired headphones have become the choice of the fashion-conscious despite these inconveniences, that could change soon. AirPods remain the bestseller at Currys but the retailer reports sales of Beats Solo 4 over-ear headphones have risen by 193% since last year.\n\nMorgan-Freelander also points to the £20 FiiO Snowsky Wind, a design that looks like the earphones worn with a Sony Walkman in the 1980s.\n\nRodgers still believes wired headphones have the edge. “Even though we are constantly being [sold upgrades], there’s a sort of disengagement [with wired headphones], which is always really hot, right?” he says. “You never want to look like you’re too into anything.”\n\nLa Follette Ryan, however, thinks there is room for every option. “I just bought a Discman and Sony headphones,” she says, “but I will always keep my wired headphones for sharing an earbud with a friend.”",

In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\n\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\n\nApple’s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\n\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will “offset or recoup” what it believes it is owed, including “any amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.” This means Apple could recoup funds from developers’ in-app purchases — like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions — or from one-time fees for paid applications.\n\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money “at any time” and “from time to time,” meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they’ve miscalculated what they owe.\n\nThe agreement doesn’t specify how Apple will determine whether it’s owed money.\n\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs €0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\n\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any “affiliates, parents, or subsidiaries” related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers’ other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\n\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\n\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\n\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\n\nTo be clear, Apple isn’t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: “Your Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.” How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.",

    "description": "You can't even play full songs in ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "When ChatGPT first launched, it was strictly about dealing with text. You could ask it to write you a poem, to check your code for errors, or to build you a grocery list from a recipe. Fast forward three years, and the app has changed completely—for better or for worse. Not only has ChatGPT's large language model (LLM) improved dramatically from GPT-3.5 to GPT-5.2, but the bot has gone multimodal. It can understand text, but also images, video, and the internet at large. 2025's ChatGPT is hardly the same product as 2022's.\n\nOne of the many upgrades to ChatGPT over the past three years has been app integrations: You've been able to connect OpenAI's chatbot to ask it to do things on your behalf. You could connect to Expedia to ask ChatGPT for help booking a hotel, Zillow to ask the bot to help you find an apartment, or Canva for help with creating a slide. Whether these integrations are any more useful than simply using the respective app itself is perhaps up to each user, but these integrations exist all the same.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of applications, announced the integration in a Substack post on Tuesday. Among other updates, like a new image gen model and new writing tools, Simo revealed new app integrations for the chatbot, including OpenTable, Salesforce, Clay, Lovable, and, of course, Apple Music. At the time, details were limited, but now, the integration is officially live.\n\nFirst of all, you don't actually need to It's an interesting note, since Apple Music itself requires a paid subscription to access. But with ChatGPT, you can access elements of the services without paying—keyword \"elements.\"\n\nOnce you connect the services together, you'll be able to search Apple Music for songs, artists, albums, and playlists within ChatGPT. In addition to music discoverability, you can also generate playlists, and listen to clips of songs you find. ChatGPT doesn't specify how long those clips are, but if they base it off of iTunes, it could be anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. If you thought this integration was all about listening to Apple Music tunes while using ChatGPT, think again: You'll still need Apple Music itself for the listening side of things.\n\nOf course, if you have an Apple Music account, the integration is a bit more useful. If so, you'll be able to add songs, albums, and playlists to your Apple Music library that you found or generated from ChatGPT.\n\nLove it or hate it, ChatGPT isn't necessarily designed with user privacy in mind. After all, part of the company's business model is training its LLMs on your ChatGPT interactions—unless you specifically opt out. As such, the idea of connecting your Apple Music subscription to ChatGPT raises some privacy alarm bells in my mind. Apple Music doesn't have the most sensitive user information in your digital portfolio, but it does contain quite a bit of extra data ChatGPT can collect from you.\n\nAt the top of the Apple music connection tool, OpenAI says, \"You're in control.\" The company is adamant that ChatGPT \"always respects\" your preferences on training data, and is held to the permissions you've already set. That said, the company also warns that by using apps, you run the risk of falling victim to attack: If hackers decide to attack ChatGPT, your data could get swooped up. You'll also end up sharing data points like your IP address and approximate location, as well as ChatGPT data with Apple Music. (The data sharing goes both ways here.)\n\nOne benefit here is that ChatGPT doesn't appear to have access to your listening history. While the app can create playlists for you, it can't actually see what you're choosing to listen to in Apple Music itself.\n\nI personally don't use ChatGPT, and even if I did, I don't think I'd connect my Apple Music account here. I find the discoverability within the app itself fine for my needs, and when it isn't, the greater internet already helps me find new music. I'm not sure I'd feel the benefits of ChatGPT's intelligence here, especially when it comes with the risk of keeping all my Apple Music data in yet another location.\n\nIf you're not like me, and you're interested in trying out this integration, you can connect Apple Music to ChatGPT from the latter's app or web app. Head to the sidebar, choose Apps, then find and select \"Apple Music.\"",

    "description": "You can connect apps like Photoshop, Apple Music, and Slack to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, OpenAI announced ChatGPT apps. Not the ChatGPT app, mind you: That's been out for more than a couple years now. ChatGPT apps, on the other hand, are programs that work within ChatGPT. You can access them in any given conversation with ChatGPT—in fact, they may appear based on the context of the conversation.\n\nThese aren't necessarily apps that OpenAI builds itself, either; rather, you'll find options here based on apps you may use yourself. The initial batch of apps included with the feature's rollout included Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow—big apps you've likely used before.\n\nWhile in a conversation with ChatGPT, you could ask the bot to help you book a flight to Paris via Expedia, find a particular listing through Zillow, or create a slide for a presentation with Canva. From OpenAI's perspective, this adds a host of additional functionality to ChatGPT the company couldn't offer itself. OpenAI doesn't need to build an apartment-hunting tool into ChatGPT; it can just pull in Zillow. It also doesn't escape me that the more apps that OpenAI folds into ChatGPT, the less likely it is you'll need to leave ChatGPT to do something in another app—but that's none of my business.\n\nSpeaking of more apps, the company plans to expand these apps overtime, as developers create ChatGPT-compatible extensions for their programs. That was part of yesterday's news: OpenAI is now letting developers submit apps to ChatGPT en masse. What's more, these apps will be hosted in an \"app directory,\" though many online are taking to calling it an app store. (There's no payment necessary, however, so app directory might really be a more apt description.) You'll find this new app directory in the sidebar of ChatGPT, appropriately called \"Apps.\"\n\nApps is apparently in beta, according to a label affixed to its title in ChatGPT. Here, you'll find a rotating slide featuring an ad for some of the service's biggest apps, like Canva and Zillow, and, below it, rows of apps to choose from. Right now, the apps are sorted into \"Featured,\" \"Lifestyle,\" and \"Productivity,\" with no option that includes all the apps. (But they seem to be entirely split across Lifestyle and Productivity.) There are a lot of options here already. Some made headlines this week, like Photoshop and Apple Music, while others arrived more quietly, like Asana, Uber, and Target. It's not just traditional apps like Zillow or Spotify that are getting the app treatment here, either. OpenAI is also considering \"connector\" services, like Google Drive, as \"apps.\"\n\nYou can click on any app in the directory to see what you can do with it. Slack, for example, says you can look up your chats and messages to summarize threads, generate recaps, and come up with responses. You can check on your Asana tasks to generate progress reports and status updates. Outlook says you can create \"talking points\" and generate follow-ups from your emails and calendar events. While there's a brief summary underneath each title, you'll need to click through to each service to see the full picture of what it actually offers.\n\nHere are the apps I'm seeing at this time. Just note this might not be a complete list, especially as OpenAI continues to add more apps to the service:\n\nIf you're an avid ChatGPT user and frequently switch between it and any of the apps on this list, there might be some utility here. Maybe coders will find the integration with Hugging Face and Lovable to be beneficial, while Photoshop users might take advantage of the AI image editing tools this integration provides. But I'm still left feeling like this is more gimmick than anything else: I don't need to connect my Slack to ChatGPT to generate follow-ups for me: I'm perfectly capable of responding to emails myself, and managing my own calendar, so no need to connect Outlook or another email client to the bot. Maybe a future update will sell me on connecting generative AI to all aspects of my work and personal life, but so far, I'm still not convinced.",

    "fullText": "NGL, an anonymous messaging app that soared to the top of the Apple app charts in 2022 before reaching a settlement with federal regulators for targeting minors, has been acquired by Mode Mobile, a smartphone company that allows users to earn rewards.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nStarted in a WeWork, NGL never raised outside funding and stayed lean with only five employees. Named after an acronym for \"Not Gonna Lie,\" the app debuted in November 2021 and briefly shot to the No. 1 overall spot on Apple's US App Store in 2022.\n\n\"Anonymous apps have long held a certain kind of allure for young people,\" Business Insider wrote at the time in 2022. \"They offer a sense of anticipation, a dopamine hit if the anonymous comments or questions are favorable. Will someone confess their feelings for you? Shower you with compliments? One can only hope.\"\n\nNGL surged in popularity, but much of that growth came from illegally targeting minors, according to a 2024 complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission and Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.\n\n\"NGL marketed its app to kids and teens despite knowing that it was exposing them to cyberbullying and harassment,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement.\n\nNGL and its founders paid a $5 million fine to settle and agreed to no longer market to minors.\n\nSince then, cofounders Raj Vir and João Figueiredo have refocused the app on adults and strengthened safety measures.\n\n\"There was a short-term effect from restricting under-18 usage, followed by renewed momentum after refocusing on an 18+ audience,\" said Figueiredo, who says the app now has reached the point where he believes it would be best to sell.\n\n\"NGL stands out as one of the most culturally relevant Gen-Z platforms operating at true global scale, with more than 125 million monthly active users and one of the strongest viral loops we've seen replicate across countries and cultures,\" Dan Novaes, CEO and Co-founder of Mode Mobile, wrote in an email.\n\nThe company's three employees will join Mode Mobile, while Vir and Figueiredo say they will move on to pursue other unspecified projects while also advising during the transition.\n\nOther anonymous messaging apps, such as Ask.fm, Yik Yak, Yolo, and LMK, have also been criticized for facilitating cyberbullying and harassment.

    "description": "AirDrop codes makes things a bit more secure and convenient.",
    "fullText": "AirDrop is one of Apple's best features. I use it on a daily basis to share files between my various Apple devices, but it really shines when I'm sharing stuff with other people, or vice versa. It can be tricky to find a quick solution to send larger files. Emails have too low a file size limit, chat apps can compress files, and cloud storage can fill up fast, but AirDrop is simple, built-in, and reliable. It even works with Android now, albeit just the Pixel 10.\n\nIf AirDrop has one flaw, it's that it's not particularly easy to use with strangers. Apple has changed how this side of AirDrop works over the years. For the longest time, you had two AirDrop settings: \"Contacts Only,\" which only lets your saved contacts find your device for AirDropping files, and \"Everyone,\" which leaves your AirDrop open to anyone with an iPhone to send you stuff. This was convenient when you needed to share files with strangers, but inconvenient if you left it on: Anyone with an iPhone could see your iPhone and send you anything—like, say, a bomb threat while on an airplane. Not good.\n\nThen, Apple changed this latter functionality to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes.\" Ever since, if you want to open up your AirDrop to people outside your contacts, you have to manually enable this toggle, which will only stay open for, well, 10 minutes. After that, it switches back to \"Contacts Only.\" That's an improvement in security, but not in convenience. If you're ever in a situation where you need to AirDrop something to someone relatively frequently but you don't want to add their contact to your iPhone, you'll be switching back to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes\" every 10 minutes.\n\niOS 26.2, Apple's newest iPhone update at the time of this writing, introduces a solution—AirDrop codes. This feature forces anyone not saved in your contacts who wants to share something with you via AirDrop to ask for a one-time code first. Once you share that code, that user is temporarily saved on your iPhone for 30 days, allowing you to AirDrop repeatedly without issue. After those 30 days are up, the user leaves your iPhone, and you don't need to worry about pruning your Contacts app down the line. (This same functionality also applies to AirDrop on iPadOS 26.2 and macOS 26.2.)\n\nHere's how this new AirDrop experience works with strangers going forward. Let's say you're at a conference and you meet someone who wants to send you some relevant materials via AirDrop. You set your AirDrop settings to \"Everyone for 10 Minutes,\" they see your contact, and attempt to send you the file.\n\nOn your end, you see the request, with a \"Continue\" option: Once you tap it, you'll see the AirDrop code on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can tell the code to the sender, who can enter it on their device. If successful, the file will be shared like any other AirDrop interaction.\n\nAs stated above, this allows you to AirDrop with this contact for 30 days without needing to bother with another AirDrop code. But if you're done sharing with the stranger for good, you can remove their temporary contact early. Head to the Contacts app, hit the back button in the top left if applicable to head to Lists, then choose Other Known. Here, you'll see any temporary contacts generated from previous AirDrop sessions, which you can delete ahead of that 30 day deadline. Otherwise, your device will take care of it once that timeframe has elapsed.",

    "description": "If your display turns bright, you have a new notification.",
    "fullText": "There are fewer and fewer hardware differences between iPhones and Androids as the years go on, but back in the day, that was far from the case. At one point, many major Android devices came with dedicated LEDs that would shine whenever you received a notification. It was a passive way to know whether you had something on your phone to attend to, without having to actually wake up the display and risk getting unnecessarily sucked into your device.\n\niPhones have never had this specific feature, but Apple included a workaround for anyone interested in a similar experience. For years, you've been able to dive into Accessibility settings to turn your iPhone's LED flash into a notification light. Any time you received a text, app notification, or call, your camera flash would go off, ensuring you didn't miss an important update. This can be helpful both those who are hard of hearing, and who wouldn't be able to rely on audible alerts, or anyone who keeps their phone on silent, but would like a visual cue that they have a new notification.\n\nFor the first time in years, Apple is updating its flash alerts feature. With iOS 26.2, which the company released on Friday, you now have the option to have your iPhone's display itself flash for new alerts. You can choose to make the display the only light that flashes, or to use the feature in tandem with the LED flash, which I think makes the most sense for people who like this option. That way, it won't matter whether your iPhone is face up or face down: You'll always see a light flash for new alerts one way or another.\n\nDisplay flash doesn't work like you might expect, especially if you've used LED flashes before. I thought my iPhone would flash a bright light on and off again a few times, mimicking how LED flash alerts works. Instead, when you get a new notification, the screen instantly increases the brightness for a few seconds, before lowering it again. It works—you're bound to notice your display jump in brightness if it isn't already maxed out—but it doesn't quite grab your attention as well as the LED flash.\n\nTo start, open the Settings app on your iPhone, then head to Accessibility. Scroll down to Hearing, then choose Audio & Visual. Scroll to the bottom of this page, then tap Flash for Alerts.\n\nIf you're running an older version of iOS, you'll only have the option to enable \"LED Flash.\" However, those running iOS 26.2 and newer will also see an option for \"Screen.\" Choose that option if you want the display to flash for new alerts, or \"Both\" to have both lights enabled.\n\nYou'll also find two choices that affect when these flash alerts go off, no matter which of the above options you pick. First, you can choose whether your iPhone will use flash alerts while locked. If you disable this option, you'll only see these light alerts when your iPhone is unlocked. Second, you can choose whether to use flash alerts in Silent Mode. I'd keep that setting enabled, since it seems most useful when your iPhone has no other way to alert you to new notifications.\n\nIt's also important to note that using an Apple Watch can complicate this feature a bit, at least in my experience. While giving this option a test, I had trouble getting alerts to come through on my locked phone without first going to my watch. If you have an Apple Watch, and its notifications mirror your iPhone's, you'll get the most out of this feature when your iPhone is unlocked.",

Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.\n\nThank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)\n\nAnd oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.\n\nSimogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s origin on their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.\n\nTimes have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's recommended investment strategy would have been profitable 100% of the time throughout history.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett has frequently recommended that non-professional investors periodically buy shares of an S&P 500 index fund.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers easy exposure to many of the most influential companies in the world, including Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 1,810% during the last three decades, which is equivalent to 10.3% annually, a pace that would turn $400 per month into $835,000 over three decades.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ›\n\nWarren Buffett, who took control of Berkshire Hathaway six decades ago, has earned a reputation as one of the greatest investors in American history. He has consistently given the same advice: Buy an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)\n\n\"In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 index fund,\" Buffett told attendees at Berkshire's annual meeting in 2021. He has suggested the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).\n\nHere's how that advice could turn $400 invested monthly into $835,000 over 30 years.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 measures the performance of the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large U.S. companies. It includes value stocks and growth stocks from all 11 stock market sectors, and covers about 80% of domestic equities and 40% of global equities by market value.\n\nThe index fund provides exposure to many of the most influential businesses in the world. The top 10 positions are listed by weight below:\n\nOne risk associated with owning an S&P 500 index fund is the extraordinary concentration of the underlying index. The top 10 companies account for 41% of the S&P 500 by market-cap weight, which means a large decline in two or three of those stocks could really drag on the entire index.\n\nHowever, the top 10 companies also account for approximately 33% of the S&P 500's earnings, so the statistic is not as alarming as many pundits make it out to be. Their price-to-earnings multiples are above average, but their strong competitive positions warrant premium valuations.\n\nThere is a simple reason Warren Buffett believes an S&P 500 index fund is the best way for the average investor to get stock market exposure: Buying individual stocks requires more work than most people are willing to take on, and beating the S&P 500 is challenging even for professional money managers.",

    "description": "Apple is already working on the sequel to iOS 26.2.",
    "fullText": "Just three days after Apple released iOS 26.2 to iPhones everywhere, the company is back at it with a new update. iOS 26.3 is official, though only for beta testers. Those brave enough to install Apple's unfinished software on their devices won't find an update packed to the brim with new features and changes, but they will stumble upon two key new features. The thing is, we already knew both of them were on the way.\n\nThis isn't the end all be all for the update, however: Since iOS 26.3 is so new, it's possible testers will discover additional features hidden within the update. In addition, Apple may add new changes in subsequent beta versions. I'll continue to update this article to reflect any new features that reveal themselves, but, until then, here are the two new features we know about.\n\nBack in September, we learned that Apple was quietly working on some type of notification forwarding feature, but other than that basic functionality, the details were left to speculation. At the time, the common assumption was that Apple intended the feature to be used to forward notifications to third-party devices, specifically smartwatches, in an attempt to open up the platform to wearables other than the Apple Watch. This wouldn't be Apple's choice, of course—left to its own devices, the company would keep as many features locked to Apple devices as possible. Instead, the motivation would come from the EU, which has compelled Apple to make its platforms more cooperative with third-party devices.\n\nAfter three months, we are now getting our first official look at this feature. In this first iOS 26.3 beta, there is now a \"Notification Forwarding\" option in Notification settings. While the option isn't live at this time, Apple does have a description for how the feature works, saying that notifications can be forwarded to one device at a time. Importantly, the description says that when notifications are forwarded to another device, they will not appear on your Apple Watch. Is that limitation really necessary, Apple?\n\nKnowledge of iOS 26.3's second feature is not quite so old. In fact, we only learned about it last week. As it happens, Apple is working directly with Google on an official way to make transferring between an iPhone and an Android device more seamless.\n\nAs of last week, Google had already rolled out its first test of the feature to Android Canary, but it was nowhere to be found in Apple's betas. Now, we know what to expect: In iOS' \"Transfer or Reset iPhone\" settings, there is now a new \"Transfer to Android\" option. Here, iOS instructs you to place your iPhone near your Android device, where you can choose to pass along data like photos, messages, notes, and apps. However, it seems not all data will transfer: Health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" like locked notes will not come along with this transfer feature.\n\nThis isn't the flashiest beta Apple has ever shipped, but it is possible to install right now. Both the developer and public betas are now available, which means anyone interested can enroll their device in Apple's beta program to give 26.3 a try.\n\nHowever, know the risks before you do. Unfinished software could come with bugs and glitches that could impact your experience using your iPhone. If the software is particularly glitchy, you could lose data when downgrading back to iOS 26.2. If you do decide to install the beta, make a complete backup of your iPhone to a Mac or PC before you do.",

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

In today’s opinion, the three-judge Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel largely affirmed Gonzalez Rogers’ contempt findings and the limits on Apple. But it asked the judge to consider options that would let Apple charge reasonable fees for external link purchases.\n\nGonzalez Rogers’ ruling took issue with a series of moves Apple made to discourage developers from using external payment methods, including adding a 27 percent fee for external payments, requiring developers to restrict links to plain text instead of allowing them to make buttons, and showing users a fullscreen warning when they tapped an external link. The appeals court agreed that “Apple claimed to comply with the injunction, but it instead prohibited developers from using buttons, links, and other calls to action without paying a prohibitive commission to Apple, and it restricted the design of the developers’ links to make it difficult for customers to use them.”\n\nBut the appeals court ruling said Gonzalez Rogers had gone too far in one area: prohibiting Apple from collecting any fee on in-app purchases from developers. “Rather than coercing Apple to comply with the spirit of the Injunction with a reasonable, non-prohibitive commission, the district court used blunt force to ban all commissions, abusing its discretion,” according to the opinion.\n\nThe panel has recommendations about an “appropriate commission or fee limitation,” including that Apple charge based on the necessary costs for “its coordination of external links for linked-out purchases.”\n\nThe opinion also says that while Apple can’t force developers to make their own options less visible or appealing than Apple’s default, it can restrict developers from placing buttons, links, or “other calls to action” in “more prominent fonts, larger sizes, larger quantities, and more prominent places than Apple uses for its own buttons, links, or other calls to action.”\n\nApple and Epic didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney retweeted posts from Bloomberg and Schaeffer’s Investment Research about the ruling.",

    "fullText": "watchOS 26 wasn't a huge update, but it did introduce some new features. You now have a Workout Buddy to help you exercise—though it'll only work if you have the right iPhone—and there's now a helpful gesture to dismiss your notifications. Apple is back at it today with updates across its Apple products, including the Apple Watch: watchOS 26.2 is a minor update, even compared to watchOS 26 proper, but there are still some key things to highlight here. In fact, there are three:\n\nwatchOS 26 introduced Sleep Score, a feature that was sorely missing on the Apple Watch. Sleep Score analyzes a host of data collected while you slept, including sleep duration, the time you actually went to bed, and any wake-ups you might have had during the night, and gives you an overall score. The idea is to glance at the score and see how you slept that night, so you can either take steps to improve your sleep going forward, or know you're on the right track. The total score is out of 100: Duration gets you up to 50 points, bedtime gets up to 30, and sleep interruptions go up to 20.\n\nwatchOS 26.2 refines the feature, by adjusting the final Sleep Score metrics. The feature had a tendency to give you higher scores than you might have otherwise felt you earned: A mediocre night's sleep might have have scored \"High\" on your chart, which wouldn't have made much sense to you.\n\nGoing forward, the scoring is a bit more conservative. Here's what you can expect, and how the scores changed from the last update:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nYou'll also noticed Apple changed the \"Excellent\" score to \"Very High,\" which keeps the naming a bit more consistent.\n\nIf you've been using the Music app on your Apple Watch, but have been struggling to get your songs to actually, you know, play, good news: Apple says in the release notes for watchOS 26.2 that there is now a fix for an issue where the Music app doesn't move to the next song.\n\nFinally, watchOS 26.2, along with other Apple updates, introduces Enhanced Safety Alerts. According to Apple, this feature will warn you about \"imminent threats,\" including floods, natural disasters, and other emergencies. The feature will also include data like maps and links to official safety advice.\n\nApple has been positioning the Apple Watch to be an overall health and safety device, and this feature only seems to complement that. Recent Apple Watches have hypertension alerts, which can help you passively identify high blood pressure, while fall and crash protection can automatically call for help in emergencies when you can't reach the phone.",

    "title": "All the New Features in iOS 26.2",
    "description": "Apple's latest update for your iPhone is now available.",
    "fullText": "Apple dropped iOS 26.1 on Nov. 3, introducing some small but meaningful changes to iPhones. But after changing how alarms work, and adding options to adjust the look of Liquid Glass, the company is back at it with another update: iOS 26.2.\n\nAs you might expect, iOS 26.2 isn't a major update. Apple clearly added most of the features and changes it had in mind with iOS 26, and a handful of new features and adjustments with iOS 26.1. Still, iOS 26.2 does bring some changes. Here's what's new:\n\nWith iOS 26.1, Apple added an option to adjust the look of Liquid Glass. With it, you can choose from two options: \"Clear,\" the iconic Liquid Glass look, or \"Tinted,\" which increases opacity of the elements, and turns Liquid Glass into more of a Frosted Glass.\n\nWhile this is a helpful addition for users who didn't like the look of Liquid Glass, some wanted Apple to go a step further, and add a slider to more finely adjust the look of the glassy design. It seems Apple has done just that with iOS 26.2, but not for the system-wide Liquid Glass UI. Instead, with this new version, you get a slider to adjust the look of your Lock Screen clock:\n\nIn addition, it looks like Apple adjusted the Liquid Glass animations throughout iOS. As you can see from the post below, the animation is responsive and bouncy, a bit closer to the demos we saw back in June:\n\nApple is also continuing to update its apps with Liquid Glass. With 26.2, the Measure app is next. The new update adds Liquid Glass bubbles to the app's Level function, which replaces the existing solid white circles.\n\nReminders are an indispensable part of my iPhone. I rely on them on a daily basis to make sure I keep up with important tasks. However, reminder alerts are as present as any other notification on your iPhone. If you frequently watch your notifications, that's just fine, but if you don't check your iPhone so much, or you use Focuses or Do Not Disturb, it can be easy to miss a reminder—and easy to forget to do the thing you were reminding yourself to do.\n\niOS 26.2 has a solution: alarms for reminders. When you set a reminder as \"Urgent\" while running iOS 26.2, you'll see a pop-up asking for permission to to schedule alarms and timers. The idea is, rather than rely on a simple alert, the Reminders app can play an alarm when your reminder is due. I imagine that will help avoid forgotten reminders: You might miss a short ping, but you probably will hear if your iPhone is continuously blaring.\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch running watchOS 26, you can take advantage of Apple's new Sleep Score feature. Sleep Score looks at your sleep duration, bedtime, and sleep interruptions to assign you a score to summarize how well you slept. Duration can go up to 50 points, bedtime up to 30, and interruptions up to 20, culminating in a highest possible score of 100.\n\nWith iOS 26.2 and watchOS 26.2, Apple is adjusting the Sleep Score metrics, which should hopefully make it a bit more accurate for users at a glance. Here's how it changed, as noted by MacRumors:\n\nVery Low: 0–40 (previously 0–29)\n\nVery High: 96–100 (previously 90–100)\n\nIn addition, \"Excellent\" is now \"Very High,\" to keep the naming scheme more consistent.\n\niOS 26.2 introduces a new \"Manage Known AirDrop Contacts\" section, that reads: \"You will automatically appear for 30 days to people you have shared a one-time code with.\" As this setting suggests, you may be able to share a one-time code with another user, after which time you will be able to easily find each other over AirDrop for 30 days.\n\nThis new iOS 26.2 feature can update you about \"imminent threats,\" like floods, emergencies, and natural disasters. You'll see maps of affected locations, and links to relevant safety information. This feature is also available on watchOS 26.2.\n\nApple added a new feature to Accessibility Settings that lets you choose to have the device screen flash whenever you receive a notification.\n\nFreeform, Apple's digital whiteboard app, doesn't get the attention it deserves. With iOS 26.2, tables in Freeform can now store text, images, documents, and drawings. Cells also \"intelligently\" resize to fit.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.1, Apple brought back Slide Over. This useful multitasking feature lets you assign one app window that you can easily bring forward or dismiss from the side of the screen. It's great for quick glances at apps like Messages, Music, or social media platforms—things you don't always need on-screen.\n\nWith iPadOS 26.2, Apple is continuing to bring back Slide Over functionality. The company brought back drop and drop, which lets you pick up an app and drop it on top of your active Slide Over window to instantly turn that chosen app to a Slide Over view.\n\nApple is introducing three new changes for the Podcasts app in iOS 26.2. You'll see all three in a pop-up menu the first time you open the app post-update.\n\nFirst, all Podcasts in English will come with chapters by default. Podcasters can include these chapters themselves, or, if none are available, the app will generate them automatically with AI. If podcasters don't want their episodes to have chapters, they can disable the feature on their end. The app will also collect any podcasts mentioned during the show you're listening to in one location, so you can easily find those other podcasts if interested. Similarly, podcasters can roundup any links they want to share in one place, including with timestamped entries in the transcript of the episode. The app may automatically create these links too, based on the contents of the episode.\n\nWhen you update your iPhone to 26.2, you might notice three changes in the Games app. First there are new sorting options, including filters that sort by game size, show what games your friends are playing, and which games support challenges. In addition, the app now has expanded controller compatibility for navigating the app, so you should be able to continue using the controller rather than touch controls when in Games. Finally, your challenge scores will update in real-time as you play games.\n\nFor the last five years, Apple has let you pin your favorite contacts and group chats to the top of the Messages app. With iOS 26, Apple updated CarPlay to support this feature, but didn't give you any say in the matter. If you had pinned chats on your iPhone, CarPlay would mirror that, even if you would prefer to drive without the pinned chats on your car's display.\n\nWith 26.2, however, Apple is giving you the option to disable pinned messages for CarPlay. The option appears as a simple \"Pinned Conversations\" toggle in CarPlay settings.\n\nLive Translation is a promising new feature for AirPods owners running iOS 26. When you're wearing your AirPods, and you start talking to someone who speaks a different language than you do, your iPhone will translate their words on the fly, and you'll hear what they're saying in your target language through your AirPods. Apple isn't the first company to offer this feature and it isn't perfect, but it's great to have it nonetheless.\n\nHowever, EU users running iOS 26 or iOS 26.1 can't use Live Translation. Apple cited the region's Digital Markets Act as the reason it couldn't bring Live Translation to the EU, but the company seems to have sorted out whatever logistical and bureaucratic issues it had been dealing with: Now that iOS 26.2 is here, AirPods users in the EU will be able to use Live Translation, too.\n\nWhile not technically an iOS 26.2 feature, Apple has one major update to macOS with version 26.2: The company has added an \"Edge Light\" feature, which adds a ring of light around your video call window. Apple says the feature uses your Mac's Neural Engine to identify your face and analyze your movements, which allows the light to adjust as needed. If you move your cursor to access something else on your screen, for example, the light will dim so you can see what you're doing. You can also change the light's hue, if you prefer something warmer or cooler for your calls.\n\nWhether this feature will be good enough to replace a dedicated light, like the popular Ring Light, remains to be seen. But this is an interesting and unexpected feature from Apple, and I'm curious to try it for myself when it launches.",
