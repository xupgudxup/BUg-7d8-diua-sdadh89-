    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "title": "14 More Lessons from 14 years at Google",
    "description": "More lessons learned from 14 years of engineering at Google, focusing on what truly matters beyond just writing great code.",
    "fullText": "A while back, I wrote down 21 lessons from my time at Google. The response caught me off guard because of which ones stuck. It wasn’t tech-specific advice. It was the stuff about people, decisions, and the messy reality of building things together.\n\nThat made me realize I’d left a lot on the table. The first list skewed toward individual craft - how to write better code, how to think about your career. But some of the hardest lessons I’ve learned aren’t about how you work. They’re about how teams work: how decisions actually get made, where coordination breaks down, what separates the groups that ship from the ones that spin.\n\nThese lessons pick up where the first left off. They’re less about being a better individual engineer and more about the systems around the engineering.\n\nEvery yes is an implicit no to something else.\n\nI’ve watched talented engineers burn out because they said yes to everything - every bug, every feature request, every “quick favor.” Their calendar filled up with other people’s priorities, and their own roadmap became a graveyard of half-finished ideas.\n\nSometimes it’s just because they truly do care so much about the product. Protect your bandwidth from “nice to have” the same way you protect production from outages. The skill is doing the right things and letting the wrong things stay undone.\n\nThe engineers who create disproportionate impact aren’t necessarily faster or smarter. They’re more ruthless about what deserves their attention. They’ve learned that the opportunity cost of working on the wrong thing is working on the wrong thing.\n\nMost meetings fail not because they’re unnecessary, but because they’re disguised journaling. I’ve sat through hundreds of hours where smart people talked around a problem without ever naming what they needed. The meeting ends with vibes and no owner.\n\nI learned to start with the ask: approve, choose, unblock, or inform.\n\nJust those four words changed how I prepare for every meeting. If I can’t pick one, I’m not ready to take anyone’s time. And when I’m on the receiving end, I’ve started asking “what decision do you need from me?” within the first two minutes. It sounds blunt, but people are usually relieved - they often didn’t realize they hadn’t defined it themselves.\n\nThe hidden cost of vague meetings isn’t just the hour you lose. It’s the week of drift that follows while everyone waits for clarity that never came.\n\nThe difference between motion and progress is specificity.\n\nTeams drown in intentions. I’ve watched roadmaps fill up with “we should improve the onboarding flow” and “we should reduce latency” and “we should document the API.” Months later, the same items are still there, gathering dust and guilt. You might think that’s a solved problem now that we have agentic engineering, but not quite.\n\nConvert talk into the smallest next action someone can actually do, then put a name and a date on it. Not “we should improve onboarding” but “On Tuesday, Sarah will run three user sessions and document the top friction points.”\n\nThis is about respecting that humans need traction to make progress. Vague intentions create anxiety. Specific commitments create momentum. The plan doesn’t have to be perfect - it just has to be concrete enough that someone can actually start.\n\nSpeed is about removing the friction that makes smart people hesitate. “Bias towards action” when you can.\n\nWhen a project drags, the instinct is to blame velocity: people aren’t working hard enough, the codebase is messy, there aren’t enough engineers. But in my experience, slow code is often a symptom. Slow decisions are the disease.\n\nIf decisions routinely take weeks or months, look deeper. Missing context means people can’t evaluate tradeoffs. Unclear ownership means everyone’s waiting for someone else to decide. Fear of accountability means people hedge instead of commit.\n\nThe fastest engineering team I ever worked with wasn’t the one with the best programmers. It was the one where decisions happened in hours instead of weeks because the authority was clear, the context was shared, and being wrong wasn’t a career risk.\n\nUsers don’t praise reliability but they do notice its absence.\n\nThis creates a dangerous dynamic: reliability work is invisible until it fails, which means it’s perpetually under-resourced compared to shiny new features.\n\nError budgets are one way to make the tradeoff explicit. If your service has an SLO of 99.9% uptime, you have a “budget” of 0.1% downtime to spend on innovation. Burn through it, and you focus on reliability until you’ve earned it back. This is a framework for having honest conversations about risk.\n\nThe teams that maintain both velocity and reliability don’t do it through heroics. They do it by treating reliability as a first-class product feature with its own roadmap, its own metrics, and its own advocates.\n\nYou wouldn’t ship a feature without product review. Don’t ship a system without some kind of reliability discussion.\n\nTeam interaction modes exist for a reason: collaboration (working closely together), service (clear API and SLAs), or facilitation (one team helping another build capability).\n\nMost cross-team pain isn’t about effort or good intentions. It’s about unclear boundaries and messy contracts. I’ve watched teams “improve communication” by adding more meetings, more Slack channels, more syncs - and it doesn’t make things better.\n\nThe problem isn’t that people aren’t talking. It’s that the interface between teams is undefined. Who owns what? What’s the contract? What can team A depend on team B for, and vice versa?\n\nChoose deliberately, and you’ll need fewer meetings to make things work. Try to paper over a bad interface with communication, and you’ll burn out your most collaborative people while the underlying dysfunction remains.\n\n“Here’s the problem” is half the job. I used to think my role was to identify issues and bring them to leadership. That’s necessary but insufficient.\n\n“Here are two options, the tradeoffs, and what I recommend” is how you get unblocked and earn trust. It shows you’ve done the thinking. It gives decision-makers something super specific to react to instead of an open-ended problem to solve.\n\nIt makes their job easier, which makes them more likely to give you what you need.\n\nThe difference between “I need help” and “I need you to choose between A and B, and here’s why I lean toward B” is the difference between being a problem-raiser and being a problem-solver.\n\nBoth identify issues. Only one earns increasing trust and autonomy.\n\nThe hero is burned out, undocumented, and a single point of failure.\n\nIf one person saving the day is a recurring pattern, that’s a failure mode rather than a badge of honor. I’ve seen teams celebrate their heroes while ignoring the dysfunction that made heroism necessary.\n\nWhen they leave - and they always leave eventually - the team discovers that no one else really knows how things work. The celebration of heroism masks a systemic problem: the path for “normal humans on a normal day” doesn’t work.\n\nMake the normal path the default. Document the system. Spread the knowledge. Design for the average Tuesday, not the exceptional crisis. Heroes should be unnecessary, and if they’re necessary, you should be working to make them unnecessary.\n\nA feature without telemetry is a liability in disguise.\n\nIf you ship a feature without knowing how it behaves in production, you shipped uncertainty.\n\nI’ve watched teams celebrate launches only to discover weeks later that their feature was silently failing for 20% of users. They had no logs, no metrics, no dashboards but a gap where understanding should be. This can cause all kinds of pain if you want to fix it, including unshipping just to properly A/B test with observability in place.\n\nLogs, traces, dashboards, and alerts aren’t “ops work.” They’re how you learn. They’re how you know whether the thing you built actually works for real people doing real things in real conditions.\n\nThe best engineers I know treat observability as part of the definition of done. Not “I wrote the code” but “I wrote the code and I can see it working.”\n\nSmall changes are easier to review, easier to reason about, and easier to revert.\n\nI used to write large pull requests. I liked the idea of a complete feature being reviewable at once. I was optimizing for my convenience at the expense of my reviewers’ sanity. Smaller PRs are often better for everyone.\n\nThey ship faster because they don’t sit in a review queue while someone tries to find an hour to understand your thousand-line diff. If you want teammates to trust your pace, make your work reviewable.\n\nThe hidden benefit is that small PRs force you to think in increments. Instead of one monolithic change, you build up capability piece by piece. Each piece gets feedback. Each piece can be rolled back independently. It’s slower per-PR but faster to actual production.\n\nCoordination cost grows faster than headcount.\n\nThis is why “just throw more people at the problem” often fails, and why adding heads late in a project can make it later. Every new person adds communication overhead with everyone they need to coordinate with. The graph gets denser, not just larger.\n\nI’ve seen managers genuinely puzzled when a team doubled in size but output barely changed. The answer is always the same: the new edges ate the new capacity. More people meant more alignment meetings, more context-sharing, more waiting for decisions that now required more stakeholders.\n\nThe solution isn’t to stop hiring. It’s to be intentional about reducing edges. Clear ownership. Autonomous teams with minimal dependencies. Interfaces that let people work in parallel instead of in lockstep. The best organizations aren’t the ones with the most people - they’re the ones with the most leverage per person.\n\nEvery migration is a negotiation between the system you have, the system you want, and the people who didn’t ask for either.\n\nI’ve seen migrations estimated at one quarter stretch to years. Not because the technical work was wrong, but because nobody accounted for the human work: convincing teams to prioritize your migration over their roadmap, supporting the long tail of edge cases nobody knew existed, and maintaining two systems in parallel while the old one refuses to die.\n\nThe technical plan is the easy part. The hard part is designing for coexistence. You will run old and new simultaneously for longer than you think. You will discover that the “legacy” system encodes decisions nobody documented and workflows nobody remembers designing but everyone depends on. You will need a adoption strategy that doesn’t require every team to drop what they’re doing at once.\n\nThe migrations that actually finish share three traits: a sponsor who stays engaged past the kickoff, a team that really owns the migration instead of treating it as a side quest, and a clear deprecation date that people believe is real. Without all three, you get a migration that’s perpetually “almost done” - which is worse than not starting, because now you’re paying the cost of two systems indefinitely.\n\nIf you’re not willing to fund the finish, don’t start the migration.\n\nEveryone can generate code now. The barrier to producing code, content, designs - it’s largely collapsing. AI will write you ten versions of anything in the time it used to take to write one.\n\nThe differentiator is choosing: what to build, what to delete, what to simplify, what not to ship, and what “good” looks like. Taste - the ability to distinguish between options and pick the right one - becomes the scarce resource.\n\nUse AI to explore options fast, then apply judgment ruthlessly. The engineers who thrive in this environment won’t be the ones who generate the most. They’ll be the ones who curate the best.\n\nProduction is cheap. Editing is expensive. Selection is everything.\n\nThis is the highest-leverage thing you can build. Not a system but credibility.\n\nWhen people trust you, they don’t need five meetings to approve a decision. They assume competence, good intent, and follow-through. Decisions that would take weeks in a low-trust environment take hours in a high-trust one.\n\nEvery time you deliver on a promise, every time you’re honest about a mistake, every time you make someone else’s life easier, you’re depositing into an account that will pay dividends for years.\n\nI’ve watched engineers with modest technical skills accomplish enormous things because everyone trusted them. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accomplish little because nobody would take their calls.\n\nThe code doesn’t matter if you can’t get anyone to ship it with you.\n\nThe first time around, I said these lessons come down to staying curious, staying humble, and remembering that the work is about people. I still believe that.\n\nBut if this second list has a through-line, it’s something more specific: the work is about making it easier for normal people to do extraordinary things on a normal day. A career in engineering gives you plenty of time to learn these things the hard way and I’ve certainly learned a lot during my time at Google so far.\n\nI hope a few of them save you a scar or two. And if they do, share what you’ve figured out with someone earlier in the journey.\n\nThat’s how the good lessons travel.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "title": "Billionaire Google founder sparks backlash after pulling $450 million megayacht into US port: 'Burned through'",
    "description": "It turns heads for its massive size and luxury.",
    "fullText": "While millions of Americans worry about rising home energy costs, one $450 million megayacht consumes enough electricity each day to supply about 800 homes.\n\nThe colossal 466-foot-long vessel was on stark display in early December, docked during the Art Basel 2025 show in Miami Beach. Called Dragonfly, the megayacht is owned by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who sailed it into Florida for the elite art showcase.\n\nWith a status as one of the largest private yachts in the world, Luxurylaunches described Dragonfly as \"something closer to a floating skyscraper than a yacht.\" The vessel has enough space to house up to 18 guests — and a 40-member crew.\n\nWhile Brin visited Art Basel, his docked megayacht continued to run its extensive energy-hungry systems — including air conditioning, lights, IT infrastructure, security systems, and more. The result is a concerning environmental impact that shows the gap between the ultra-wealthy and the average American.\n\nTogether, all of Dragonfly's luxe megayacht accommodations consume electricity at a rate equivalent to powering hundreds of average Florida homes per day. Experts told Luxurylaunches that on a heavy operational day, Dragonfly can consume an estimated 28,800 kilowatt-hours in 24 hours. The average Florida household uses about 1,104 kilowatt-hours per month.\n\n\"Dragonfly's single day at the dock equals the daily electricity use of roughly 780 to 800 Florida households,\" the outlet noted. \"Look at it another way, and it is about 26 Florida households' entire monthly consumption, burned through in 24 hours.\"\n\nWith electricity totaling an estimated $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, Luxurylaunches noted that Dragonfly's electricity bill alone comes to roughly $8,640 per day. Dragonfly runs on a hybrid diesel-electric system, which helps offset some of its environmental impact — but certainly not enough to classify it as environmentally clean or neutral.\n\nAs many communities face rising energy costs and feel the burdens of rising global pollution, the ultra-wealthy continue to burn resources at an astonishing — and largely unchecked — scale.\n\nThis massive consumption simply for pure luxury undercuts collective efforts to slow rising global temperatures. Stronger climate policy, true accountability, and greater investment in clean energy are needed to help address resource overuse and the growing damage superyachts cause to our oceans.\n\nAll superyachts also have outsized impacts on marine ecosystems and human health, regardless of whether they are electric, hybrid, or powered entirely by dirty energy. Beyond harmful carbon pollution, superyachts release wastewater, generate plastic waste, and flood marine environments with artificial light.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNotably, superyachts also generate a great deal of noise pollution, an often overlooked threat that experts warn can be as damaging as air pollution. Research links chronic noise exposure to hearing loss, sleep disruption, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and developmental delays in children.\n\nAt sea, excessive noise can interfere with whale and dolphin communication, placing species that depend on sound for navigation, feeding, and survival at risk.\n\nDragonfly may turn heads for its massive size and luxury, but its harmful environmental impact is impossible to ignore. As the realities of environmental pollution become increasingly dire, the extreme excess of superyachts like Dragonfly shows how the wealthy can sidestep environmental responsibility — while contributing to global pollution on a scale few others ever could.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless.\n\nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.\n\nThe feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)\n\nYou'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.\n\nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.\n\nApple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

It later hit $4 trillion in 2025 and briefly reached $5 trillion last October. Yet the stock has largely traded sideways since last August around its current price of $189.\n\nReasons include investor concerns over rising competition in AI accelerators from players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), geopolitical constraints such as U.S. export restrictions to China, production delays on next-generation chips like Blackwell, slowing revenue growth momentum, and valuation fatigue after years of rapid gains.\n\nThe Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0\n\nIs the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium.

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "Google Chrome 145 Released With JPEG-XL Image Support\n\nBack in 2022 Google deprecated and then removed JPEG-XL image support from the Chrome/Chromium browser codebase and now in 2026 it's back. Last month I wrote about JPEG-XL decoding merged back to Chromium/Chrome and that has rolled out today as part of today's Chrome 145 stable debut.\r\nGoogle today announced Chrome 145 being pushed out to the stable channel across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Most exciting is JPEG-XL decoding support returning to the Blink engine. Google is using the Rust-based jxl-rs decoder rather than the C++ libjxl library for better memory safety. For the Chrome 145 release the feature is gated by the enable-jxl-image-format flag.\r\nChrome 145 also adds support for the text-justify CSS property, column wrapping support in multicol, device bound session credentials, an SQLite backend for IndexedDB, reduced user-agent strings by default, Upsert, and other enhancements.\r\nMore details on the Chrome 145 features for those interested via the ChromeStatus.com blog.\n\n 1 Comment",

This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year. Last June, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "What are the odds Google will still be around in 2126? According to investors bidding on a rare 100-year bond from the tech titan this week, they're pretty strong.\n\nAlphabet is offering a 100-year bond as part of its latest borrowing bonanza to finance its massive AI spending. The firm is seeking tens of billions of dollars for its projects via debt issuance in a range of currencies.\n\nIt has already raised $20 billion from US investors this week in a heavily oversubscribed offering, and is seeking at least $7.5 billion denominated in UK sterling and $3.6 billion in Swiss francs.\n\nAlphabet is expected to spend at least $175 billion on its AI buildout in 2026. That's second only to Amazon's $200 billion among mega-cap hyperscalers. Equity investors have largely encouraged the Google parent's capex plans. The stock is up 68% in the last year.\n\nNow, bond investors are casting their own vote of confidence.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the century bonds, as well as the bonds with shorter maturities, drew strong demand. The £1 billion slice of the deal attracted £9.5 billion worth of bids. Its dollar bond offering in the US on Monday drew record demand from investors, Bloomberg said.\n\nAlphabet's borrowing spree is the latest big debt raise by a mega-cap tech company, with Meta Platforms and Amazon also recently completing their own bond sales. The move comes as investors and commentators have expressed some concern that debt financing for AI could be a risk if the market wobbles and investor appetite wanes.\n\nYet, if demand for Alphabet's bonds is any indication, there's no sign yet that investors are shying away from lending to the top tech firms pursuing AI.\n\nCentury bonds are rare in the corporate debt world. Issuance of debt at such a long maturity is seen in sovereign bond markets. Ford issued a hundred-year bond in 2021, but the market hasn't seen such an issuance from a tech firm since the 1990s, when companies like Motorola and IBM were selling them.\n\nAlphabet's bonds are highly rated by credit rating agencies, stamped Aa2 by Moody's and AA+ by S&P Global.",

    "description": "You can ask Google to remove government ID numbers from Search.",
    "fullText": "Google announced two new ways for users to remove their sensitive information from the web Tuesday morning—or, at least, remove that data from Google Search. The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images.\n\nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.\n\nTo launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own.\n\nGoogle says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.\n\nThe tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.",

    "fullText": "Critics brand deal with regulator as ‘lightweight’ with ‘no legal bite’ as tech giants avoid legally binding measures\n\nApple and Google have committed to avoid discriminating against apps that compete with their own products under an agreement with the UK’s competition watchdog, as they avoided legally binding measures for their mobile platforms.\n\nThe US tech companies have vowed to be more transparent about vetting third-party apps before letting them on their app stores and not discriminate against third-party apps in app search rankings.\n\nThey have also agreed not to use data from third-party apps unfairly, such as using information about app updates to tweak their own offerings.\n\nApple has also committed to giving app developers an easier means of requesting use of its features such as the digital wallet, and live translation for AirPod users.\n\nThe commitments have been secured as part of a new regulatory regime overseen by the Competition and Markets Authority, (CMA), which has the power to impose changes on how Apple and Google operate their mobile platforms after deciding last year that they had “substantial, entrenched” market power.\n\nHowever, the CMA has opted to allow voluntary commitments rather than impose formal changes.\n\nTom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director who represents app developers challenging Apple and Google’s dominance of the mobile platform market, said the changes were “lightweight” and had no legal bite.\n\nThe CMA did not name specific Google and Apple apps that compete with third-party rivals but both firms offer their own music services in the form of YouTube Music and Apple Music. Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.\n\nHowever, the commitments do not cover a significant bugbear for app developers – the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.\n\nThe CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.\n\nSarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.\n\nThe CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.\n\nSmith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.\n\n“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”\n\nThe News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "In Google We Trust: Why an internet company can borrow billions for a century",
    "description": "The company has become so powerful that its ability to borrow is beginning to rival, or even surpass, the US government.",
    "fullText": "This morning, I woke up to a stunning report that Google is gearing up to sell a 100-year bond.\n\nThat follows a similar move in early November, when Google issued a 50-year bond.\n\nInvestors are giving this company billions and are willing to wait up to a century to get it back. In contrast, the US government usually borrows money for a maximum of 30 years.\n\nAnd the interest rates Google is paying are not that much more than what the US Treasury pays. For the 50-year bond, Google paid about 1 percentage point more, but got an extra 20 years to repay.\n\nTo me, this means Google is now considered about as safe a bet as an entity that oversees the world's largest economy, operates the most powerful military on earth, and can print US dollars to pay back what it owes. How is this possible?\n\nIn September, something happened that changed what Google really is. After previously ruling Google was a monopoly, a federal judge delivered remedies that left the company mostly unscathed. In the words of former DOJ antitrust attorney John Newman, \"a judge just decided to let Google keep breaking the law.\"\n\nGoogle essentially became a government-approved monopoly. Other companies in similar situations, such as utilities, have their prices controlled by regulators. In contrast, Google gets to charge whatever it can get away with for online search ads.\n\nThe result is a profit gusher the likes of which the world has never seen. Net income topped $132 billion in 2025, Google reported last week. For 2026, the company plans to spend as much as $185 billion on data centers, chips, and other components to support its AI efforts.\n\nWhen you make and spend this much money, and have this much power — and regulators let it happen — then comparisons with a nation like the US become possible.\n\nWill Google be around in 2075 or 2126 to pay this money back? Right now, it has about as much chance as America to still be thriving in 50 or 100 years.\n\nThis particular 100-year bond is being issued in British pounds, according to the Financial Times. The only other entities to have borrowed for this long in this market are the University of Oxford, the Wellcome Trust, and EDF, the FT noted.\n\nMaking my point: EDF is a utility owned by the French government.\n\nA Google spokesperson said my argument was \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\"Not even the DOJ argued that Google should be regulated like a utility or that a private company should be turned into a regulated entity with capped pricing,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nGoogle is appealing the judge's monopoly ruling, which \"ignores an intensely competitive market where consumers have more ways than ever to find information online,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider. \"We're also asking that the implementation of specific remedies be paused as the appeal progresses.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.\n\nNote: Business Insider sued Google last year, alleging it monopolizes the digital ad market. Google called the suit \"meritless.\"",

    "description": "A Google executive explains why he taught his kids to understand AI — and how they ended up vibe coding and participating in a hackathon.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.\n\nKids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "title": "The Department of Homeland Security Is Demanding That Google Turn Over Information About Random Critics",
    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "title": "Ex-Google X leader thinks AI is about to expose a fatal flaw in capitalism",
    "description": "Mo Gawdat warns AI could disrupt capitalism, as automation replaces human labor, urging a rethink of economic systems for future stability.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is colliding with capitalism in a way the system can't absorb. That's what Mo Gawdat told Business Insider's Reem Makhoul over an interview in September.\n\nAfter decades working inside Big Tech, including senior leadership roles at Microsoft and Google X, Gawdat has come to believe that the economic model underpinning modern capitalism breaks once machines replace most of the human workforce.\n\n\"The very base of capitalism, which is labor arbitrage — to hire you for a dollar and then sell what you make for two — is going to disappear,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nIn Gawdat's view, AI isn't just automating tasks. It's removing the need for human labor and, eventually, human decision-making at scale.\n\nWhen that happens, wages, jobs, and consumption — the pillars that keep capitalism running — start to fall apart, he said. However, while we may be in for a rocky ride ahead, the ultimate destination is one worth aiming for.\n\nCapitalism, Gawdat argues, is built on a simple idea: pay people less than the value of what they produce, sell the output for more, and keep the difference. That model depends on human labor.\n\nAs machines take on more work, the cost of making things keeps falling. AI pushes production closer and closer to zero cost, Gawdat says.\n\nWhen that happens, familiar ideas about pricing, profit, and scarcity stop working the way they always have.\n\nYou can't run an economy on productivity alone, he added. If people don't earn wages, they can't buy things. And without buyers, the system stalls.\n\nGawdat is blunt about what he thinks comes next.\n\nHe expects large waves of job losses across blue- and white-collar work. Lawyers, analysts, writers, executives — all of them, he said, are exposed.\n\n\"Your life and mine will witness times where there will be 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment in certain sectors,\" he said.\n\nHe's especially skeptical of tech leaders who frame AI-driven layoffs as efficiency wins. In the long run, he said, AI systems will come for them, too.\n\n\"Those CEOs forget that sooner or later the AI will replace them too,\" he said, adding, \"AI is better than humans at every task, including being a CEO.\"\n\nWhat will happen when the capitalist system built around jobs suddenly has far fewer of them?\n\nWithout some form of guaranteed income, consumption collapses. And when consumption collapses, capitalism can't function. Governments will be forced to rethink how money flows through society.\n\n\"Without consumption, there is no economy,\" he said, adding, \"So they're going to have to give people some kind of income to keep going.\"\n\nHe thinks different regions will handle this transition differently. Western economies, which place heavy value on productivity and individual output, may struggle the most.\n\nDespite the warnings, Gawdat doesn't see AI itself as dangerous.\n\nHe describes intelligence as neutral — powerful, but directionless on its own. The real risk, he said, is what happens during the transition, when AI systems are highly capable but still answering to human incentives built around greed, competition, and power.\n\n\"The challenge that humanity faces today is not the rise of AI, it's the rise of AI in an age where humanity is at its lowest morality,\" he said.\n\nOver time, Gawdat believes machines will make more rational decisions than today's political and corporate leaders. That shift, he argues, could ultimately produce a fairer system than the one we have now.\n\nCapitalism, in his view, won't survive in its current form. But that doesn't mean the future has to be bleak.\n\n\"It's an invitation to change,\" he said. \"And if you change, you would create not only an opportunity to survive, but an opportunity to thrive.\"",

    "description": "Big Tech's capital expenditures soar with Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft at the forefront, ushering a new era of AI infrastructure spending.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "fullText": "Even Elon Musk sometimes hires the wrong people.\n\n\"I've fallen prey to the pixie dust thing as well, where it's like, 'Oh, we'll hire someone from Google or Apple, and they'll be immediately successful,'\" Musk told Stripe cofounder John Collison and tech Dwarkesh Patel during a 3-hour-long appearance on a special joint episode of their podcasts.\n\nIt's why Tesla's CEO doesn't put his full faith in a candidate's résumé.\n\n\"Generally, what I tell people—I tell myself, I guess, aspirationally—is, don't look at the résumé. Just believe your interaction. The résumé may seem very impressive, and it's like, 'Wow, the résumé looks good.' But if the conversation after 20 minutes is not \"Wow,\" you should believe the conversation, not the paper,\" he said.\n\nHe said he's made other mistakes, too. \"My batting average is still not perfect, but it's very high,\" he said. That includes the times he's discounted certain personality traits.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness,\" he said. \"And I think goodness of heart is important. I underweighted that at one point. So, are they a good person? Trustworthy? Smart and talented and hard working? If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing.\"",

    "fullText": "Android Auto users are reporting a bug that is making their cars disappear from the road—ok, not literally, but within Google Maps. On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.\n\nThe news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.\n\nAccording to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\n\nIf you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.\n\nThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n\nMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.\n\nIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.\n\nIf none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).",

Includes dynamically installable skillsets for Google \nservices, shell execution, file management, and task scheduling.\n\nThe Moltbot blueprint is a comprehensive personal AI automation agent that\nbrings the power of Moltbot/Clawdbot to the ChatBotKit platform. Unlike\nself-hosted alternatives that require managing infrastructure and security,\nthis blueprint provides all the automation capabilities in a secure, managed\nenvironment with enterprise-grade isolation.\n\nThe agent is accessible across four communication channels—Slack for work\nconversations, Telegram for secure personal messaging, WhatsApp for mobile\naccessibility, and Email for asynchronous communication. Users can interact\nwith their personal automation agent wherever they are, and conversations\nmaintain context across channels.\n\nAt the heart of this blueprint is a minimal-footprint main agent with just\ncore capabilities: skillset discovery, skillset installation, shell execution,\nand file management. Rather than loading all abilities upfront, the agent\ndiscovers available skillsets at runtime and installs only what's needed.\nThis pattern keeps the agent fast and focused while enabling unlimited\nexpansion.\n\nProactive Automation with Triggers\n\nFive scheduled triggers automate common workflows:\n\nAll shell commands run in isolated sandbox containers that are created\non-demand and destroyed after use. The agent has its own persistent Space\nfor storing scripts, automation outputs, and configuration files. Unlike\nself-hosted Moltbot which has full system access, this architecture\nensures even malicious code cannot escape the sandbox.\n\nGoogle services use personal OAuth secrets, meaning each user authenticates\nwith their own Google account. The agent never sees raw credentials—it\nreceives scoped access tokens that can only perform the permitted actions.\nThis provides true personal automation where your calendar, email, and\nfiles remain under your control.\n\nThis blueprint demonstrates advanced ChatBotKit patterns: multi-channel\ndeployment, dynamic skillset installation, personal OAuth, scheduled\ntriggers for proactive automation, and secure shell execution—all\ncombined into a practical personal automation assistant.\n\nCommon information about the bot's experience, skills and personality. \n\nThis example uses a dedicated Skillset. Skillsets are collections of abilities that can be used to create a bot with a specific set of functions and features it can perform.\n\nThis example uses Secrets to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.\n\nThis blueprint can be deployed using Terraform, enabling infrastructure-as-code management of your ChatBotKit resources. Use the code below to recreate this example in your own environment.\n\nCopy this Terraform configuration to deploy the blueprint resources:\n\nLearn more about the Terraform provider\n\nA dedicated team of experts is available to help you create your perfect chatbot.

    "fullText": "Compact and comfortable Pixel Buds have noise cancelling, decent battery life and good everyday sound\n\nGoogle’s latest budget Pixel earbuds are smaller, lighter, more comfortable and have noise cancelling, plus a case that allows you to replace the battery at home.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a uses the design of the excellent Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few high-end features at a more palatable £109 (€129/$129/A$239) price, undercutting rivals in the process.\n\nThat makes the Buds 2a some of the smallest and most comfortable earbuds on the market, with a disc the size of a Smartie chocolate protruding from your ear canal and no stalk to get in the way of earrings.\n\nEach earbud has a small silicone stabiliser that rests against the inside of your ear opposite the tip to securely hold them in place without putting undue pressure on any soft tissue. That makes them super comfortable for long periods of listening time without feeling as if they’re going to fall out, even during vigorous movement.\n\nThe disk is touch-sensitive for tap controls for playback, noise cancelling and accessing Gemini. They work well but they lack the excellent swipe gesture for volume control from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which is a shame.\n\nThe battery lasts a solid seven or so hours with noise cancelling while the compact flip-top case recharges the buds about 1.8 times for a total of 20 hours playback. The case is great, but the white picks up marks easily, including staining from jeans and other clothing.\n\nWater resistance: IP54 (splash resistant)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.4 (SBC, AAC)\n\nBattery life: 7h with ANC (20h with case)\n\nEarbud dimensions: 23.1 x 16 x 17.8mm\n\nCharging case dimensions: 50 x 57.2 x 24.5mm\n\nThe Buds 2a have the same Google Tensor A1 chip as their Pro siblings, which ensures rock-solid connectivity with any standard Bluetooth device, including Android phones, iPhones, tablets, consoles and computers. The Pixel Buds app on Android adjusts settings and controls, but Google’s web app can do similar on a Mac, Windows PC or Chromebook in the browser.\n\nThey can connect to two devices at once and support the standard SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats. Call quality is reasonable if a bit quiet, meaning you have to talk up in silent spaces, and they let through background noise on busy streets but not enough to drown out my voice.\n\nThe earbuds can also be used to talk to Gemini Live on a compatible phone, including reading out notifications and other features.\n\nGoogle does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The batteries in the earbuds are not replaceable but the battery in the case can be replaced with standard tools. Repair specialists iFixit awarded the earbuds four out of 10 for repairability.\n\nThe Buds 2a are made with at least 41% recycled materials including cobalt, plastic, rare-earth elements and tin. Google breaks down the earbuds’ environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.\n\nThe sound quality is very good for a set of everyday earbuds. They do a good job with most genres, with solid separation of tones, plenty of bass where needed and relatively detailed mids and highs. They sound great with rock, pop and electronica, but lack a bit of nuance in classical tracks.\n\nThe Buds 2a also support spatial audio with compatible phones, but not head-tracking, which is a feature reserved for their more expensive siblings. It works well with film and TV shows with a Pixel phone.\n\nThe new buds are the first in Google’s A-series to have active noise cancelling. It is not quite as effective as that in the Buds Pro 2, but does a very good job for the money. It reduces road roar and engine noise, street sounds and background hubbub, but struggles to keep out higher tones such as the clicks of keyboards or chatter in the office.\n\nThe cheaper buds also lack adaptive sound and the ability to automatically dampen loud noise when using the ambient sound mode, but I don’t think they are crucial features.\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds 2a cost £109 (€129/$129/A$239).\n\nFor comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost £169, the Nothing Ear 3 cost £149, the Fairphone Fairbuds cost £66.75, the Apple AirPods 4 cost from £119 and the AirPods Pro 3 cost £219.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a are a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for more than just Android at a good price.\n\nTheir compact form and shape make them very comfortable and discreet, lacking the stalks that are popular with rivals. The battery life is solid, the case nice and compact, and they work well, connecting to two devices at once.\n\nThey sound great for everyday earbuds and the noise cancelling is good for the money. They lack a few bells and whistles including onboard volume control, adaptive audio and wireless charging, plus their call quality is only average.\n\nOne of the best upgrades is an easily replaceable battery in the case, which is progress towards better sustainability. But the batteries in the earbuds remain irreplaceable, ultimately making them disposable.\n\nPros: compact, comfortable, seven-hour battery, great case, good sound and noise cancelling, multipoint Bluetooth, case with replaceable battery, web app for use with computers.\n\nCons: earbuds unrepairable, no volume control gesture, no support for higher quality Bluetooth formats, average call quality, no adaptive audio or loud noise protection for transparency",

    "fullText": "Alphabet reports $34.5bn profit and revenue soars 48% in recent quarter as it plans a sharp increase in AI spending\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, and is planning a sharp increase in capital spending in 2026 as it continues to invest deeply in AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet on Wednesday reported profit of $34.5bn in the recently ended quarter, as revenue from cloud computing soared 48%.\n\nThe company also forecast spending between $175bn and $185bn this year, a figure much higher than analysts’ expectations of roughly $115bn.\n\nIn an earnings call, investors pressed Alphabet’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, on the significant increase. “We’ve been supply constrained, even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.\n\nAlphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own data centers “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered tool known as a “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.\n\n“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board, Pichai said.\n\nAlphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.\n\nThe company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.\n\nThe report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.\n\nThe newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that has prompted panic at competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stock jumped 3% when Google debuted the model.\n\nThen in January, Google and Apple announced the company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously faced criticism for not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuation shot up to $4tn after the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.\n\nAnalysts viewed the multi-year agreement as a huge win for Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of 2.5bn active devices.\n\n“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.\n\nLike larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.\n\nBut investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.\n\nAs the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.\n\nThe driverless car division Waymo is working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that its Chrome browser will adapt more Gemini AI features, too.\n\nGoogle is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built an illegal monopoly over online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed only modest limits on the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have all aggressively ramped up spending.\n\nOn earnings calls with investors last week, Meta and Microsoft both said they'd spent more in 2025 than initially forecast.\n\nWhile both companies surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations for the quarter, only Meta's stock went up on the news.

    "fullText": "Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.\n\nThe stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nWall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:\n\nAlphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026.\n\nThe company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"\n\nThe company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.\n\nAdvertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.\n\nAshkenazi said \"advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.\n\nThat business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.\n\n\"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient,\" Pichai said. \"We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements.\"\n\nOther Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.\n\nWaymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.\n\nThe self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.\n\nWATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobs",

    "description": "Alphabet's Q4 results beat estimates. Google plans to double capex in 2026, while search and cloud remained strong.",
    "fullText": "Google just reported another blockbuster quarter, with its fourth-quarter revenue soaring past Wall Street expectations,\n\nThat said, you might not think it to look at the stock, which took a dip after Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, predicting it will spend between $175 billion and $185 billion — far beyond analysts' prior expectations.\n\nSome upbeat numbers softened the blow, with Google's search advertising and cloud business running hot. Google announced its annual revenue had exceeded $400 billion for the first time, while quarterly revenue hit $113.8 billion, above estimates of $111 billion. Google Cloud became a particularly bright spot, with revenues up 48% year over year.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Alphabet's earnings call.\n\nLet's get the big one out of the way. Google said on Wednesday that it expects capital expenditures of between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026. That's the money going to data centers, chips, construction materials, and other components needed to build out and support Google's AI efforts.\n\nIt's a huge figure. Google previously warned that its capex spend would be higher than last year's, when it spent just over $90 billion. Its updated guidance for 2026 surpassed street expectations and sent the stock tumbling 2% after its otherwise very healthy earnings report.\n\nGoogle's capex estimate is even higher than Meta's, which last week said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion for 2026, nearly doubling its spend from last year.\n\nGoogle said its Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. That's 100 million more than it had in October last year.\n\n\"We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the call on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the graph trends in the right direction, it also suggests a slowdown, as Google said in October that it had gained 200 million extra users over Q3, aided by the rollout of its viral Nano Banana image generator.\n\nGoogle said on Wednesday that it now has over 325 million paid subscriptions across its consumer services, with Google One and YouTube Premium the most popular.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, Netflix announced last month it had also hit 325 million subscribers. It's not a total like-for-like comparison — Netflix doesn't have a cloud storage product, for one. Still, with YouTube clearly taking a big chunk of those users, it should be enough to alarm Netflix's leaders.\n\nGoogle likes to talk up its full-stack AI advantage. By owning everything from AI models to cloud servers and chips, Google gains more control over the technology and how it all fits together.\n\nOn Wednesday's call, Pichai flagged that Google was seeing significant benefits from this, lowering Gemini's serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 \"through model optimizations, efficiency, and utilization improvements.\"\n\nSoftware stocks took a hammering this week after Anthropic rolled out new features that could perform clerical and administrative tasks for people in the legal industry.\n\nCould this be another \"DeepSeek moment,\" as Evercore senior managing director Mark Mahaney suggested on the call? Pichai suggested the scramble this week might be overblown.\n\n\"I think it is an enabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services, be it Search, YouTube, etc,\" Pichai said of Gemini, saying that companies that are \"seizing the moment\" will \"have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "Google has had a great run since its last earnings report. Can it last?\n\nThat's the big question ahead of the tech giant's earnings report this afternoon. BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "description": "Microsoft's security boss Charlie Bell is moving to a new role as an individual contributor.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's security boss, Charlie Bell, is moving to a new role as an individual contributor, and the company hired Google executive Hayete Gallot to replace him, according to an internal memo from CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nGallot is a former Microsoft executive who joined Google in 2024 as president of customer experience for Google Cloud. Nadella called out Gallot's 15 years of experience at Microsoft in senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, and said Gallot was instrumental in the company's security business.\n\nBell, considered a key building of Amazon Web Services, joined Microsoft in 2021 to run a newly formed organization focused on cybersecurity. There was recent speculation inside Microsoft that Bell was preparing to retire. Bell's new role will be \"focused on engineering quality,\" according to the memo.\n\nMicrosoft has faced security challenges during Bell's tenure.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security in 2024, for example, condemned Microsoft for what it called \"a cascade of security failures\" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers.\n\nMicrosoft, that same year, expanded what the company calls its Secure Future Initiative, making security the top priority for every employee, including adding security as a metric on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews.\n\nBell was expected to be a candidate to replace Andy Jassy when he took over as Amazon CEO for founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Instead, Jassy chose Adam Selipsky, who was previously AWS's de facto chief operating officer until he left in 2016 to become CEO of Tableau. Selipsky stepped down from that role in 2024.\n\nI am excited to share a couple updates in two of our core priorities: security and quality. Hayete Gallot is rejoining Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Security, reporting to me. I've also asked Charlie Bell to take on a new role focused on engineering quality, reporting to me.\n\nCharlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer. And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!\n\nHayete joins us from Google where she was President, Customer Experience for Google Cloud. Before that, she spent more than 15 years at Microsoft with senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, playing multiple critical roles in building two of our biggest franchises — Windows and Office, leading our commercial solution areas go to market efforts. And she was instrumental in the design and implementation of our Security Solution Area. She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now.\n\nAs we shared during our quarterly earnings last week, we have great momentum in security, including progress with Security Copilot agents, strong Purview adoption, and continued customer growth, and we will build on this.\n\nWe have a deep bench of talent and leaders across our security business, and this team will now report to Hayete. Additionally, Ales Holecek will take on a new role as Chief Architect for Security, reporting to Hayete. Ales has spent years leading architecture and development across some of our most important platforms and will help bring that same sensibility to security and its connections back to our existing scale businesses and the Agent Platform.\n\nAs we shared yesterday, we have a new operating rhythm with commercial cohorts, and Hayete and her team will now be accountable for our security product rhythms as part of this process.\n\nCharlie built our Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management organization and helped rally the company behind the Secure Future Initiative. And we're fortunate to have his continued focus and leadership on another one of our top priorities. With our Quality Excellence Initiative, we have increased accountability and accelerated progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we always deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. And Charlie will partner closely with Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on this work.\n\nI'm excited to welcome Hayete back to Microsoft to advance this mission critical work, and grateful to Charlie for all he has done for our security business and what he will continue to do for the company.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Sustainable smartphone takes a step forward with modular accessories, a good screen and mid-range performance\n\nThe Dutch ethical smartphone brand Fairphone is back with its six-generation Android, aiming to make its repairable phone more modern, modular, affordable and desirable, with screw-in accessories and a user-replaceable battery.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 costs £499 (€599), making it cheaper than previous models and pitting it squarely against budget champs such as the Google Pixel 9a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade.\n\nThe new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don’t drop it in a bath or swimming pool.\n\nThe back plate is held in place by two exposed Torx screws and hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed.\n\nThe power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots or the power-off and restart menu. They are also very easy to hit accidentally when pulling the phone out of a pocket, ramping up the volume unnecessarily.\n\nAbove the power button on the right side is a big, colourful switch that turns on Fairphone’s “Moments” minimalist interface, which blocks notifications and swaps the standard Android home screen for a simple list of essential apps. It’s a smart idea for those hoping to reduce distractions. But swiping up to exit an app shows the regular home screen for a split second, making it feel like a hack. The switch can be repurposed for other features, including activating “do not disturb” or the torch.\n\nScreen: 6.31in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (431ppi)\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3\n\nCamera: 50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfie\n\nConnectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP55 (splash/rain)\n\nDimensions: 156.5 x 73.3 x 9.6mm\n\nThe Fairphone 6 has the same mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip as the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which can’t rival the best phones for raw power but generally feels fast enough in use. It will handle light gaming and most tasks but will struggle with more advanced titles. The phone has 256GB of storage and a rare microSD card slot for adding more.\n\nThe battery life is reasonable if not remarkable, lasting about 35 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about four to five hours across 5G and wifi. The Fairphone should see out most heavy-use days, but will need charging nightly.\n\nThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles and it can be replaced at home using a single screwdriver, along with the rest of the 12 modular components. Batteries cost £35, screens £78 and the main camera £61. The phone was awarded 10 out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit.\n\nThe handset is made with 50% recycled or fair materials, and Fairphone publishes its lifecycle report.\n\nThe phone either runs regular Android 15 with Google services, as reviewed, or a privacy-focused, open-source version of Android, without Google services, called /e/OS. Unfortunately, that means the Fairphone 6 isn’t running the latest version of Android 16, but it will be supported with updates until 2033, which is about a year longer than the best mainstream phones.\n\nThe software is generally uncluttered with little in the way of customisation, which for the most part is a good thing. But it is a little rough around the edges and lacks a few of the bells and whistles that Samsung, Google and others add to their software.\n\nIt is notably devoid of the artificial intelligence that has been shoved in every crevice by other phone manufacturers. It has Google’s Gemini chatbot assistant, but without the ability to activate it via voice while the phone is locked. The Fairphone also misses out on Google’s excellent Circle to Search feature common to most other phones, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nRecent updates have fixed some of the bugs, including one in which the screen stuttered and stalled after being turned on from standby. But the software still lacks the level of polish you should expect.\n\nThe Fairphone has two cameras on the back and one selfie camera in the screen. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good photos in bright light, but it struggles with high contrast scenes, often misjudging the white balance or looking washed out. The night mode is usable but not as good as you’d expect from a modern smartphone.\n\nThe 2x digital zoom is reasonable but stretching to 10x causes the photos to become full of artefacts. The 13MP ultrawide camera produces pretty good photos in decent light, with solid detail in the middle of the frame even if they are a little soft at the edges. The macrophotography mode can produce great closeup images with a bit of practice, and the 32MP selfie camera takes good photos for the money.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 easily has the best camera the company has made and gets the job done, but it can’t hold a candle to similarly priced rivals.\n\nThe Fairphone Gen 6 costs £499 (€599).\n\nFor comparison, Google’s Pixel 9a costs £499, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro costs £449 and the Apple iPhone 16e costs £599.\n\nThe sixth-generation Fairphone takes the company further into the mainstream with a solid, mid-range Android with all the perks of a modular, repairable and more ethical design.\n\nIt trades a few premium features for a lower price than its predecessors, but still has a good screen, great looks and reasonable battery life. It even has a microSD card slot for adding more storage, which is incredibly rare in 2026.\n\nThe camera is serviceable, though far from the best you can get for the money. The software is basic Android 15, which is unfortunately not the latest version, a little rough around the edges and devoid of AI tricks other than Google’s Gemini chatbot. But Fairphone is slowly fixing bugs and will provide support until 2033. The distraction-free Moments mode switch is a good idea, too. The chip is fast enough now, but it isn’t the most powerful and may become pretty tired after eight years of use.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner is not the best and the power and volume button placement is an irritating design flaw. While few phones offer as repair-friendly a design, more mainstream devices offer almost as long software support as the Fairphone.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 is the best, least-compromised phone the company has made. But things have improved in the rest of the industry, with better access to repair and longer software support, making the Fairphone tough to recommend for everyone over mainstream devices.\n\nPros: modular accessory support, repairable-at-home design, software support to 2033, recycled and fair materials, microSD card slot, good screen, five-year warranty,\n\nCons: mid-range performance, fingerprint scanner and volume button placement annoying, average camera, cannot be submerged in water, no Android 16 yet and software is a little rough around the edges.",

    "description": "Google's Q4 earnings focus on AI spending, Cloud gains, and a major Apple deal. Wall Street eyes search dominance amid AI competition.",
    "fullText": "Google has been on a monumental tear as of late. Can it keep the good times rolling?\n\nWhen Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will focus on AI spending, cloud wins, and a big Apple deal.\n\nWith Meta projecting its capex for this year to nearly double that of 2025, how high will Google go? The company said in October that it expected capex for 2025 to land between $91 and $93 billion. Investors will track if it sticks to those goals. Google's finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, also said the company expected a \"significant\" increase in that number for 2026 and promised we'd hear more on Google's Q4 call this week.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Ciolli has observed this earnings season, investors are more willing to forgive big capital spending on AI as long as fundamentals remain chugging along.\n\nThat leads to the question of how Google's search advertising business, its core engine, is doing. Are OpenAI and other AI rivals chipping away at its dominance, or is Alphabet's money-printing machine whirring as proudly as ever?\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein appeared optimistic in a note this week, writing that they expect Google to have seen an increase in query volume in Q4.\n\n\"For Tinuiti's advertisers, Google's US paid click growth was the highest it has been since early 2021,\" Bernstein analysts wrote, referring to the US marketing agency.\n\nGoogle's cloud business has also become top billing, as it furiously competes with Amazon and Microsoft to build infrastructure and win crucial AI deals. In Q3, Google said the number of new cloud customers increased by about 34% year over year.\n\nBernstein analysts predicted big business for cloud off the back of AI sales, its big Anthropic deal, and the ramp-up of its AI chip business, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\n\"We also note that the new deal between Anthropic and Google for 'tens of billions of dollars' worth of compute represents upside to Google Cloud growth, regardless of whether the money flows through Cloud deals or outright TPU sales,\" they wrote.\n\nSpeaking of deals, this marks the first earnings report since Google and Apple announced that the iPhone giant will use Google's Gemini AI models for its revamped Siri assistant.\n\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions there. How much does Google get out of the deal? Can Google use query data to train Gemini? Will Apple use Google's data centers and TPU chips?\n\nHopefully, we'll get a clearer picture of the inner workings of that deal on Wednesday's earnings call.",

    "description": "A senior software engineer at Google took 40 Coursera courses and got multiple grad degrees to shift from business to AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Max Buckley, a 38-year-old senior software engineer at Google, based in Zurich, Switzerland. His identity and employment has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer at Google in Zurich, where I've worked since 2013.\n\nMost people don't go from business to a more technical background, but my bachelor's degree was in business studies, and I joined Google out of undergrad as a financial analyst intern.\n\nOver several years, I pivoted from financial analysis to business analysis, then to trust and safety, and onto an engineering team in 2016. I joined several other software engineering teams, and then eventually joined Google Cloud AI, where I worked on one of the cloud AI products for a few years.\n\nThen I joined an internal LLM innovation team within Google's core infrastructure group, which we later turned into an LLM information retrieval applied research team, where I am today, leading the team.\n\nTo make multiple shifts like this, you need to upskill and explore other areas. Here's how I did it:\n\nAs soon as I joined Google, I decided my North Star was to become a data scientist. Initially, I had a lot of success broadening my skillset with online courses like Coursera, edX, or Stanford. I used them to explore finance, then statistics, then spent most of my time in the computer science and data science space.\n\nAll in all, I completed roughly 40 online open courses, most of them through Coursera.\n\nSome of the courses I took include:\n\nThe courses were spread out from 2013 to 2021, and I took them on evenings and weekends. I didn't have much time for video games, but I still made time to go to the gym, eat, sleep, and spend time with my girlfriend.\n\nI wasn't super structured in my approach to taking courses. I didn't say \"I must do five hours a day,\" or anything like that. I took them as I felt the need to do one or to learn more about a particular topic. I didn't burn out from it.\n\nThe most measurably impactful courses I completed were the first two Coursera courses: Data Analysis and Computing for Data Analysis. I did them right before I interviewed for my internship at Google and the interviewer happened to have done the same course, so we had this instant rapport.\n\nI also did more formal part-time study.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Business Studies in 2013. Then at Google, I got a part-time postgraduate certificate in statistics, which took a year. Then I did a part-time master's degree in Business Analytics, which took two years. Then I pursued a part-time master's degree in software engineering, which took close to five years. Most recently, I did a diploma in Advanced Studies In Data Science, which took another two years.\n\nI did a bunch of summer school certificates, which is when you spend a week doing PhD-level courses.\n\nMy message to others who want to transition is don't be discouraged. When I first wanted to join Google, several hiring managers weren't interested because I didn't have a computer science undergraduate degree. Similarly, when I applied for a Master's in Business Analytics, I was initially declined because I didn't have a technical undergraduate degree and two semesters of programming experience, even though I was programming at Google. There were hurdles that I had to work around.\n\nI always wanted to study computer science, but my dad told me it's better to learn something different because I'll probably end up in it anyway. In hindsight, he was right.\n\nStudying computer science would have certainly expedited my career track, but I'm in a place where it's no longer a hindrance, and I'm familiar with a bunch of business theories, like Porter's Five Forces. They're not always useful, but every once in a while, it comes up in conversation.\n\nThe constant here is that my background includes continuous learning. When recruiters or hiring managers see my profile, they see that I'm not someone who gets complacent.\n\nDid you make a career pivot? We want to hear from you.

XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "title": "Google Pushed Back the Deadline on Migrating Your Fitbit Account (Again)",
    "description": "If you've been dragging your heels, you have a little more time—but don't wait too long.",
    "fullText": "When Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, it announced that all users would eventually need to link their devices to a Google account to continue using Fitbit's features and services. Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension.\n\nNow, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.\n\nFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\n\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:\n\nSign in to your Fitbit account.\n\nTap Settings and select Move account.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\n\nDuring the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.\n\nIt's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.\n\nFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n\nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.\n\nThere also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.\n\nDespite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.",

    "description": "Igor Tsvetkov says he faced a \"lot of stress\" as a senior staff engineer at Meta. But securing a demotion isn't easy, he said. Now, he's at Google.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?\n\nIgor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.\n\n\"I did not fit in perfectly,\" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. \"It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.\"\n\nHis slow ramp-up caused a \"lot of stress,\" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.\n\nOn \"The Peterman Pod,\" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.\n\n\"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,\" Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov needed to \"start from zero,\" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was \"generous\" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.\n\nHe also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.\n\nWhile Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTsvetkov eventually said he asked management: \"Can I actually drop a level?\"\n\nThat's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.\n\n\"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,\" he added. \"I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.\"\n\nA Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "description": "I followed a hackathon team as they raced to vibe code an app in seven hours at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.",
    "fullText": "Just after sunrise, four vibe coding enthusiasts from Malaysia crossed into Singapore with a loose idea — and a bet that AI could build most of their app.\n\nHours later, they were racing to prototype it at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThe four friends, all in their late 30s to 40s, came from different professional backgrounds. Chan Wei Khjan is an accountant. Chan Ler-Kuan lectures on AI at a private university. Loh Wah Kiang works in IT. Lee How Siem, who goes by Benny, is the chief technology officer of a Malaysian startup.\n\nTheir initial idea was a \"feng shui\" app to analyze properties in Singapore — a potentially lucrative use case in a market obsessed with housing and wealth accumulation. Feng shui is a traditional Chinese practice that evaluates how a person's surroundings, along with birth factors, influence luck and well-being.\n\nI embedded with the team at Google's developer space in Singapore in January to observe how a vibe-coding project comes together — or nearly falls apart — in seven hours.\n\nThe assignment: Teams of up to four people had to build a working demo, publish a public repository with code, and submit a short video explaining their project by 5:30 p.m.\n\nEach project had to fit into one of six tracks, including generative media, deep research, and enterprise orchestration.\n\nOrganized by Google DeepMind and 65labs, Singapore's AI builder collective, the hackathon featured a 100,000-credit Gemini API prize pool, with first place getting 30,000 credits.\n\nThe team had pivoted to a new idea due to time constraints: a feng shui app that could analyse a user's outfit and workspace through the phone camera in real time and assess how \"lucky\" they were.\n\nWei Khjan took the lead on prompting. He typed the first instructions into Claude, asking it to generate the workflow and code. Ler-Kuan focused on whether the AI's output aligned with feng shui concepts. Wah Kiang and Benny hovered over the codebase, refining ideas and flagging issues.\n\n\"For people who don't know how to read code, it's helpful to have people who do,\" Wei Khjan said.\n\nWhile waiting for the code to be generated, Ler-Kuan opened Google's AI Studio to design the app's logo. They called their app \"Feng Shui Banana.\"\n\nAfter about an hour, Claude generated the initial codebase for the app. It was designed to work with the Gemini Live API, enabling real-time image and text analysis. It ran but was riddled with bugs.\n\nAn error message flashed when they tested the camera feature, so Wei Khjan copied the error back into the AI and asked for it to be fixed. Minutes later, the feature worked.\n\nIt wasn't right. The feng shui logic was off, especially where colour analysis intersected with the user's birth timings. Ler-Kuan manually corrected the underlying dictionary and its mappings.\n\nThe team kept prompting to tighten the features: shorter explanations, clearer output, and more streamlined user interfaces.\n\nLunch arrived. The team stayed glued to their screens.\n\nThe app didn't respond instantly when a user changed their outfit, nor did it update its feng shui analysis in real time.\n\nWei Khjan explained how one prompt matters. Instead of issuing commands, he asked the AI to \"discuss it with me.\" The shift changed how the model reasoned, and it worked more like a collaborator.\n\nAfter some prompting, the app updated with a real-time camera analysis. It was striking to watch a feature emerging from a short back-and-forth with AI.\n\nI helped the team test the app.\n\nThe camera correctly identified what I was wearing: a dark green polo, a yellow participant tag, and a white name card hanging from my neck. According to the app, I was already wearing colours aligned with my luck for the day.\n\nThe app suggested small tweaks, such as additional accessories, that could enhance the feng shui of my outfit.\n\nThey finally had lunch and joked around to ease the tension. Four hours remained before they had to submit their project.\n\nLer-Kuan shifted focus to workspace feng shui, feeding knowledge into the model and refining how the app would evaluate desks and work setups. Wah Kiang and Benny worked on the video demo.\n\nThe team also revisited the app's tagline. After cycling through suggestions from multiple AI models, they settled on a line that didn't come from an AI at all: \"A wisdom, not a superstition.\"\n\nThey used Gemini to generate a storyboard for the demo video. The model laid out several scenes and drafted the script. The team followed along, filming clips and stitching everything together as they went.\n\nTheir workspace feature was also up and running.\n\nThe app had come together nicely. With some time to spare, they decided to add audio output for users who prefer listening to reading on a screen.\n\nThe first attempt to generate a voice using AI fell flat. It sounded robotic.\n\nAfter debugging and several iterations, they landed on a voice they liked, similar to how a Chinese feng shui master might speak.\n\nAs the deadline approached, the team was still stitching clips for their video and nitpicking the AI-generated presenter voice.\n\nThe organizers had urged teams to submit early. With about 15 minutes to spare, they made the call to lock the final cut and hit submit.\n\nThen it was over. The hunger hit immediately, and everyone got in line for some well-deserved food.\n\nEven as an observer, watching from the sidelines was tiring. Seven hours of vibe coding turned out to be anything but effortless.\n\nThe team didn't win a prize, but agreed that the hackathon had been worth it.\n\n\"Sometimes, the best experiences come from saying 'yes' without overthinking,\" said Ler Kuan. \"Innovation starts with curiosity and a little bit of spontaneity.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "fullText": "A project inside Google is attempting to supercharge employees with cutting-edge AI abilities — and hopes to turn the company into an \"AI-powered workplace.\"\n\nThe initiative, codenamed \"Project EAT,\" was spun up inside Google's \"AI and Infrastructure\" unit, according to internal documents reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe unit, internally abbreviated AI2 and led by company veteran Amin Vahdat, spearheads work on data centers, chips, and other key ingredients that underpin Google's AI technologies.\n\nAccording to internal documents, Project EAT was created to help employees adopt various AI products and standardize their use across the organization.\n\nProject EAT was created in May 2025 and began as a grassroots initiative among employees, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider. They added that it has led to the creation of some AI productivity tools that Googlers across the company are now using.\n\nIt comes as Google leaders, like those at other tech companies, are pushing for employees across the company to adopt AI into their workflows.\n\nPer an internal mission statement for Project EAT, the goal is to ensure AI2 is at the cutting edge of AI — from productivity tools to coding.\n\n\"We envision a future where Google is transformed into an AI-powered workplace, leading to dramatically higher productivity, greater employee engagement and collaboration, improved quality of work, better work-life balance, and greater product innovation across the company,\" it reads.\n\n\"We aim to lead Google into this vision by first leading this organizational change within AI2.\"\n\nWhile Google is aggressively shipping AI tools to customers and businesses, it's also fast adopting AI tools and practices internally.\n\nLast June, engineering VP Megan Kacholia sent an email telling engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Shortly after, CEO Sundar Pichai sent a clear message to staff: our rivals are using AI, and we need to do the same to compete.\n\nGoogle appointed Vahdat to lead its infrastructure group last year, and in December, he was promoted to senior vice president, reporting directly to Pichai. Vahdat played a key role in shaping Google's strategy with its AI chips, known as TPUs, and has spearheaded Google's efforts to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nAs tech companies pour billions into AI capital expenditure, a huge share of it at Google is going into Vahdat's org. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that A12 employs more than several thousand people.\n\nAn internal FAQ for the Project EAT page, reviewed by Business Insider, states that it had a 12-week seed-stage. It notes that this included a push for state-of-the-art code assistance tools within the AI2 org and that the test period resulted in \"promising signs of improved developer velocity, reduced toil, and enhanced code quality.\"\n\nThe name Project EAT is a reference to Google employees eating their own dog food, a spokesperson confirmed. Dogfooding is a common practice at tech companies where employees internally test and iterate products before launching them to market.\n\nInternal documents suggest EAT is pilot-testing new AI products and standards within AI2, with the goal of eventually adopting them across the company. \"The primary goal of Project EAT is to dramatically accelerate the adoption and integration of Google and 3rd party AI technologies within Al2.\"\n\nIt adds: \"We expect to improve standard practices across engineering, product management, TPM, and operations, thereby mitigating risks associated with the rapidly evolving external AI landscape and ensuring Google's technological leadership.\"\n\nHave something to share?

He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "fullText": "It’s what I had the most fun using Google’s Project Genie for, at least right now.\n\nIt’s what I had the most fun using Google’s Project Genie for, at least right now.\n\nThis week, a new generative AI tool from Google let me create bad knockoffs of 3D Nintendo worlds.\n\nCheck out my version of something like Super Mario 64:\n\nI didn’t like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but it’s better than my version of a Metroid Prime experience:\n\nOr how about my take on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, complete with a paraglider (and, briefly, a second Link):\n\nIt was all possible thanks to Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that Google gave me access to this week, though I don’t think I’m using it in exactly the way Google intended.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has been putting a lot of effort into building its AI “world” models that can generate virtual interactive spaces with text or images as prompts. The company announced its impressive-looking Genie 3 model last year, but it was only available as “a limited research preview” at the time. Project Genie, which will be rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US starting today, will be the first opportunity for more people to actually try out what Genie 3 is capable of.\n\nGoogle is releasing Project Genie now partly because it wants to see how people use it. “It’s really for us to actually learn about new use cases that we hadn’t thought about,” Diego Rivas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, tells The Verge. The company is already excited about how Genie could help to visualize scenes for filmmaking or for interactive educational media. You could, if you wanted, take a photo of your kids’ favorite toy and use it to prompt a Genie-generated world. Genie could potentially help robots navigate the real world, too. But Project Genie isn’t yet an “end-to-end product that we expect people to just use every day,” stressed Shlomi Fruchter, a Google DeepMind research director.\n\nWith Project Genie, you pick from a bunch of worlds designed by Google or define prompts for the environments and characters you want to create in your own world. After a brief wait, Genie first generates a thumbnail, then you can have it generate the world. You can explore each generated world for 60 seconds, and each has a resolution of about 720p and a frame rate of about 24fps. While you’re in one, you can (typically) move your character with the WASD keys, jump or go higher with a tap of your space bar, and turn the camera with arrow keys.\n\nOne of Google’s worlds, called “Rollerball,” features a blue orb in a white, snowy world, and as you roll around, the orb leaves a trail of paint behind it. As a “game,” Project Genie wasn’t great. There was nothing to do but roll around; there weren’t any objectives or goals. There was no sound. There was frustrating input lag that was even worse than what I sometimes experience with cloud gaming. (Some of this could be due to the generally poor Wi-Fi I get in my office.)\n\nOver the course of the 60-second experience, Genie sometimes forgot to show a paint streak where I had previously rolled. Occasionally, the ball would randomly stop laying down paint at all. So I started to distrust Genie’s ability to recall what I had already seen with my own eyes.\n\nAnother Google-designed world, “Backyard Racetrack,” was a little more fun because there was an actual track to follow. My racing lines were awful — the input lag didn’t help — but I enjoyed trying to make the turns and stay on the road. Near the end of the experience, though, part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass, which ruined the immersion. And the wheel rims looked really janky.\n\nI had a lot more fun pushing the limits of Project Genie to try and make 3D, AI-generated games featuring recognizable characters, like with my Super Mario, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda-themed worlds. While they made me laugh, the worlds don’t have scores or anything to strive for, so there’s nothing to do but walk or jump around. Even if there were specific things to do, the input lag made the worlds basically unplayable. (Again, this may be a Wi-Fi issue, but even when I was closer to my router, I still experienced lag.)\n\nI wasn’t able to make everything I wanted. Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of Kingdom Hearts — here was my prompt, if you’re curious:\n\nIt’s a world filled with Disney characters with a steampunk vibe. Donald and Goofy are your sidekicks. Jack Skellington is present, as is Cloud Strife.\n\nYou are a spunky, anime teenager with spiky brown hair wielding a blade that is like a key.\n\nWhen I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me.\n\nI asked about why I was able to generate worlds with Nintendo characters. “Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides,” Rivas says. “As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback.” Rivas also notes that the Genie 3 model was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web.” (This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are many videos of people jumping in Breath of the Wild and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from.) Shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on Super Mario 64 due to “interests of third-party content providers.”\n\nAssuming Google clamps down on the ability to generate interactive worlds based on known gaming franchises — I can’t imagine Nintendo will be happy with what I was able to generate! — Project Genie otherwise isn’t that great at the moment. The input lag and 60-second limit make them pretty poor interactive experiences. Occasionally, I couldn’t control my character at all, only the camera. After the weirdness with the paint stripes and the road turning into grass, I had a general feeling that I couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent from moment to moment.\n\nProject Genie is better than some AI-generated worlds I tried last year, but it’s still much worse than an actual handcrafted video game or interactive experience. Fruchter described a potential future where the line blurs between different kinds of media thanks to technology like Genie, but I think it has a long way to go to get there.\n\nPerhaps my standards are too high. Project Genie is an experimental research prototype, after all. And maybe I’ll feel differently after the technology improves down the line. But I can’t imagine that people will want to spend an extended period of time jumping into these types of AI-generated worlds anytime soon. With world models, I don’t think we have to worry about the genie being out of the bottle just yet.",

    "description": "There are new enhancements to Failed Authentication Lock and Remote Lock.",
    "fullText": "Phones are valuable targets. If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:\n\nFirst, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings.\n\nGoogle is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan.\n\nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n\nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course.\n\nThese updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.",

    "description": "You might want to disable the buggy \"Take a Message\" feature on your Pixel phone.",
    "fullText": "A recent Google Pixel feature is reportedly turning on the microphone when it's not supposed to, and Google's finally acknowledged that there's a bug. Reports started as early as last September and gained traction last week, and now, Google has removed the feature on some older phones.\n\nCalled \"Take a Message,\" the buggy feature was released last year and is supposed to automatically transcribe voicemails as they're coming in, as well as detect and mark spam calls. Unfortunately, according to reports from multiple users on Reddit (as initially spotted by 9to5Google), the feature has started turning on the microphone while taking voicemails, allowing whoever is leaving you a voicemail to hear you. Audio leaks are bad in any circumstance, but they must feel especially nasty if you're trying to pretend you're not there.\n\nAffected users have have found that while the caller can hear the audio from the person receiving the voicemail, there's no indication on the receiver's end that their audio can be heard, aside from the green microphone indicator possibly turning on.\n\nThe issue has been reported affecting Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 10, and on a recent support page, Google's finally acknowledging it. However, the company's action might not be enough, depending on how cautious you want to be.\n\nAccording to Community Manager Siri Tejaswini, the company has \"investigated this issue,\" and has confirmed it \"affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances.\" The post doesn't go any further on the how and why of the diagnosis, but says that Google is now disabling Take a Message and \"next-gen Call Screen features\" on these devices.\n\nNext-gen Call Screen is a separate feature that allows Google's AI to ask a caller their name and the purpose of their call before taking a message. No bugs have been reported for it, but Google says it's disabling both features out of \"an abundance of caution.\"\n\nWhile this should prevent the issue from popping up for users with those phones, it's a bit of a heavy-handed fix. I've reached out to Google to check if Take a Message is only being removed temporarily while the company fixes the bug, or if it will now be permanently gone. In the meantime, Tejaswini does say that Pixel 4 and 5 owners will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening, which provide basic protection against spam. The post also suggests that affected users can rely on any call screening features provided by their cellular carriers.\n\nWhile it's encouraging that Google is taking action on the Take a Message bug, the company only seems to be acknowledging it for Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 models, at least for now. I've asked Google whether owners of other Pixel models should be worried, as user reports seem split on this. Still, because some have mentioned an issue with even the most up-to-date Pixel phone, if you want to practice your own abundance of caution, it might be worth disabling Take a Message on your device, regardless of its model number.\n\nTo do this, open your Phone app, then tap the three-lined menu icon at the top-left of the page. Navigate to Settings > Call Assist > Take a Message, and toggle the feature off.",

    "description": "Google said it will let websites opt out of generative AI features in Search. Cloudflare's CEO says that's just a start.",
    "fullText": "Google said its Search engine could break if the company is forced to implement strict new controls to protect and nurture web content in the AI era.\n\nThe warning came after UK antitrust regulators proposed new rules for Google Search that would give publishers more control over how their content is used in AI features such as Google's AI Overviews and AI Mode.\n\nIn response, Google said it is working on new ways to give websites more control over how AI chatbots and AI-powered answer engines access and use online content. The company faces mounting pressure to give content owners ways to opt out of having their data crawled for AI, while still allowing traditional search engines to index this valuable data.\n\n\"We're now exploring updates to our controls to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features,\" Google said on Wednesday in a blog post.\n\nThat's a major concession from Google, which has been quietly but firmly pushing back against such demands.\n\nYet, the tech giant also warned that strict new controls could threaten its prized Search engine, which generates most of the company's profits.\n\n\"Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,\" the company said, arguing that search and AI are now deeply intertwined.\n\nGoogle says AI has been core to how Search works for more than a decade, helping rank results and surface relevant links. Creating sharp opt-outs for generative AI features, Google suggests, could undermine the basic mechanics that allow people to find information quickly and allow websites to be discovered at scale.\n\nAt stake is a deeper question about what Search should be in the AI era. Publishers increasingly argue that AI summaries substitute for their content rather than pointing users to it, undermining the grand bargain that has underpinned the web for decades. Google counters that drawing hard lines between search and AI risks unintended consequences, including degraded results and a worse user experience.\n\nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said the UK's proposal is \"progress,\" but didn't go far enough. His company helps run about 20% of the web and has been pushing for new standards to level the AI playing field.\n\n\"The CMA's recommendation today doesn't go far enough because it doesn't force Google to split search crawl from AI crawl,\" Prince told Business Insider, referring to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. \"Instead, it requires us all to trust that Google will not be evil when they build their unauditable black AI box.\"\n\n\"If the CMA wants to encourage innovation and competition in AI, the best thing they should do is force Google to play by the same rules as everyone else and split crawl for AI from the crawl for search,\" he added. \"Every company other than Google would support that because it fosters a healthy market. It's a no-brainer, so it's disappointing the CMA didn't go far enough today.\"\n\nA CMA consultation runs until February 25. Whether regulators can tighten the rules without, as Google warns, breaking Search may help determine not just the future of Google in the UK, but the shape of the open web itself.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Google Chrome User Should Know",
    "description": "There's a lot to dig into in Google's browser.",
    "fullText": "It feels as though Google Chrome has been around forever, but it's actually still just a teenager: The browser launched back in 2008, originally just for Windows—though it's now made its way to macOS, Linux, and mobile devices too of course. It's a powerhouse of a browser that is more widely used than any other.\n\nIn the 18 years since its release, Chrome has changed a lot: A host of features have been added and taken away down the years, and it's very possible that you don't know everything that Chrome can do, even if you use it every day. Here are my favorite hacks for Chrome, covering everything from casting tabs to playing audio and video.\n\nIf you've always stuck with the 'out of the box' Chrome aesthetic, you might not be aware that it's relatively simple to change up the theme of the browser—which covers the colors of menus and tabs, as well as what you see on the new tab page. To see the available options, open up a new tab, then click the Customize Chrome button (lower right).\n\nYou can apply any of the color themes just by clicking on them, or set up your own colors by clicking the color picker (the little pipette icon). For a more significant visual overhaul, click Change theme: You'll then see a range of options created and curated by Google. Click Chrome Web Store to see more official and third-party themes you can install.\n\nIt's fair to say Chrome doesn't have the best reputation for efficient RAM usage, but you can get some of it back. In any tab, click the three dots (top right), then choose Settings > Performance, and activate the Memory Saver option. As Google explains, this will put tabs you've not used in a while in an inactive state, and recover some RAM from them.\n\nIt's not a Chrome feature that gets much attention, but you can cast tabs wireless to a big screen via Google TV or Chromecast devices. It's useful for everything from music streaming to slide presentations, though the latency is usually too high for video playback (and bear in mind that YouTube, for example, has its own casting button for this).\n\nWith a tab open in Chrome, click the three dots in the top right corner, then choose Cast, save and share > Cast. You'll then be asked to choose the device to cast to (which must be on the same wifi network of course). Via the Sources button, you can choose to cast just the tab you're in, or your entire Windows or macOS desktop, including Google Chrome.\n\nJust because you use Google Chrome doesn't mean you have to use Google Search—maybe you want to switch to a privacy-first alternative, like DuckDuckGo. To set up search engines in Chrome and change the default one, click the three dots in the top right corner of any tab, then choose Settings, and open the Search engine page.\n\nUse the Add button to add new search engines, the pencil icons on the right to edit their details, and the three dots on the right to set which one is used by default (when you type some search terms into the Chrome address bar). Each search engine can also have a shortcut: Type the shortcut into the address bar to run a search using that specific site.\n\nTab grouping can make it much easier to manage the myriad tabs you've got open in every single session—these groups can be moved and closed and saved all together, so you could set up different groups for different research projects, for example, or for different tasks in the browser (maybe one for work-related browsing and another for shopping).\n\nThe easiest way to get started with tab groups in Chrome is to right click on a tab header and pick Add tab to new group from the pop-up menu. Give your tab a name and color, and if you then right-click on other tab headers, you'll be able to add them to the group (or create a new one). Right-click on the headers of grouped tabs to access further options.\n\nUser profiles are a hugely powerful Chrome capability that more people should know about: It lets you split your browsing into work and personal categories, for example, (and separate Google accounts, if needed). It means that logins, browsing history, and all the other data that gets stored in Chrome don't all get lumped together in one place.\n\nSo, you could use your work profile for the day, and then switch to your personal profile at night—making it easier to access your Netflix login and Amazon shopping history, for example. To get started with profiles, click your current profile avatar (in the top right corner, next to the three dots), then choose Add Chrome profile from the menu.\n\nIf you're prepared to invest some time and effort into your Chrome hacking, give the Tampermonkey extension a look (it's actually available for several browsers, not just Chrome). The tool lets you inject your own custom code to modify the websites you're looking at, so you can alter the appearance or even the functionality of pages.\n\nYou could remove distractions from a page, for example, add your own keyboard shortcuts for navigation, or insert new buttons for sharing links on social media. We don't have the space for a full tutorial here, but if you head to the Tampermonkey website you'll find a wealth of help to get you started, plus some links to user script repositories on the web.\n\nThere are plenty of powerful web apps you can get at through Chrome—Slack, Gmail, Spotify—and Google's browser lets you set these up as if they were desktop apps in Windows or macOS. You can get a shortcut straight to the app on the Windows taskbar or macOS dock, and when you launch it, it appears in its own distinct desktop window.\n\nWith the web app open in Chrome, click the three dots (top right), then choose Cast, save and share > Install page as app. You'll then be asked to give your new app a name, and click Install to confirm. The app launches right away, and you can then organize it into your Windows or macOS system as you want (by pinning it to the taskbar, for example).\n\nChrome comes with a built-in Safety Check that runs an audit on passwords, security updates, third-party extensions, and more. You can find the Safety Check screen by clicking the three dots to the top right of any tab, then choosing Settings > Privacy and security: As well as running the check, you can follow the recommended actions.\n\nGoogle Chrome can handle more than webpages: It's also able to open up PDF documents, and image, video, and audio files saved in common formats (like MP3 or MOV). Just drag a file into an empty tab to open it, or associate the file type with Chrome in Windows or macOS (which means it'll automatically open in the browser when you double-click on it).\n\nChrome isn't the most advanced PDF editor or video player you're ever going to see, but it's a quick and easy way of opening up local files without having to launch an entirely separate program each time. You could use this alongside the Split View feature, for example, to watch a video stored on your system while making notes in Google Docs.",

Renner said that Gallot's reports would report to him in the interim to \"ensure a seamless transition and continued momentum.\"\n\nGallot joined Google last April to spearhead a new division focused on helping customers and businesses adopt the company's cloud products, including its AI offerings. The group absorbed several other teams inside Cloud at a critical time for Google, which has been aggressively courting businesses with its AI products.\n\nShe joined from Microsoft, where she was a corporate vice president overseeing the go-to-market plan for its commercial segment.\n\nGallot's departure this week confused some staff inside Google Cloud who were surprised to see her leave after less than a year at the company, two employees told Business Insider. A spokesperson confirmed Gallot was leaving the company, but did not share more on the reasons for her departure. Gallot could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"We have made incredible progress in evolving our GTM organization to meet the unique moment we have with our customers, our partners and across the industry,\" Renner wrote in the Tuesday memo.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "It's nearly impossible for outsiders to understand how a platform works, whether that's TikTok, Google, or anything else. Skepticism makes sense.",
    "fullText": "Say a Trump-friendly group of owners bought TikTok, and wanted to change the way TikTok worked — so it showed more stuff that was Trump-friendly, and less that wasn't.\n\nHow would they go about doing that?\n\nI'm no engineer, but I would think that would be a pretty difficult project. You'd need to do it pretty subtly, over an extended time period, so people wouldn't notice it right away. Right?\n\nWrong, say some people who use TikTok. They point to Sunday, when TikTok stopped showing anything related to the death of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti. They also note that at one point, TikTok prohibited users from using the word \"Epstein\" in direct messages to each other. And some TikTok creators insist that anti-Trump posts they created weren't getting the same distribution they used to.\n\nAnd all of this, they say, is related to the fact that late last week, a group of companies from the US and Abu Dhabi took control of (some of) TikTok's US operations, via a deal brokered by the Trump administration.\n\nThe new US TikTok says that's not the case. It says its entire operation was screwed up Sunday because one of Oracle's data centers had an outage. (TikTok didn't formally identify Oracle in its statements, but on Tuesday night, Oracle raised its hand and acknowledged that it was the \"US Data Center partner\" TikTok was referring to. Oracle now owns 15% of the new US TikTok.) It also says the Epstein direct message issue was a bug it is fixing, though it hasn't described how the bug came to be.\n\nAnd all of that seems pretty plausible to me.\n\nOn Saturday, my feed was full of posts about the latest killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal agents. And on Sunday, those were all gone — but so was everything else I normally saw on my TikTok, like Liverpool soccer highlights and copyright-violating clips of action movies and TV shows. Instead, I got clip after clip of videos extolling the virtues of Corvettes.\n\nBut on Monday, everything was back to normal: My TikTok was full of rage-inducing clips about Alex Pretti's death, including multiple ones where creators urged viewers to learn how to use guns to defend themselves from the government. And while I don't normally use TikTok's DM feature, or send messages about Jeffrey Epstein, I was able to do that without a problem on Tuesday.\n\nAll of which suggests that TikTok's answer — we had to unplug the machine and plug it back in, basically — sounds pretty plausible to me. And much more plausible than, \"The new US TikTok has immediately started censoring anti-Trump views.\"\n\nBut that's the theory that a bunch of high-profile people, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Chris Murphy, are running with.\n\nAnd while some of the people complaining may have a specific motivation for their complaints — both Newsom and Murphy are consistent critics of the Trump administration, for instance — it's easy enough to understand why people might think TikTok really is up to something.\n\nFor starters, one of the reasons US TikTok is no longer run entirely by ByteDance, its original owner, is because US lawmakers told us they were worried that China might influence what TikTok users saw in America. But now US TikTok is owned by Trump allies — most notably Oracle founder Larry Ellison — and Trump has made it clear that he wants media and tech companies to promote things he likes and demote things he doesn't. So it's not outrageous to believe that TikTok's new bosses might put their thumb on the scale for Trump.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that it's nearly impossible, from the outside, to understand why a platform's algorithm behaves the way it does. You can certainly make informed guesses, and you might be right. But you're still guessing, and your guessing is often informed by the way you think the platform should operate.\n\nConservatives, for instance, complained for years about the way Twitter and Facebook treated them — up until Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and Mark Zuckerberg pivoted to Trump in 2025. Digital publishers are consumed with the vagaries of Google Discover — the platform many of them are now dependent on for traffic referrals. Now, AI engines are the new target for bias claims.\n\nBut proving that something is up — one way or another — is just about impossible in any systemic way: Yes, maybe your latest post isn't getting the views your other posts used to get. But does that mean the platform is censoring you? Or just swapping out your free content for someone else's free content it thinks will perform better?\n\nEven more confounding for us outsiders: Sometimes we really do find out that a human being — not software — made a decision to push something out of sight on a platform they run. In 2020, Twitter, then run by Jack Dorsey, hid a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop because the company believed it might be part of a disinformation plot against Joe Biden. (Twitter later reversed itself, and Dorsey apologized publicly.) Musk, after buying Twitter, reportedly told his engineers to boost his posts on his own platform.\n\nAnd we most certainly live in an era where trust in every institution is frayed. So when a big platform stops showing you what you want to see, there are plenty of reasons to think that something's afoot. So maybe one day we will find out that the new US TikTok really is trying to promote Trump and tamp down his foes. I don't think that's true now — but how can I tell, for sure?",

    "fullText": "AlphaGenome can analyse up to 1m letters of DNA code at once and could pave way for new treatments\n\nResearchers at Google DeepMind have unveiled their latest artificial intelligence tool and claimed it will help scientists identify the genetic drivers of disease and ultimately pave the way for new treatments.\n\nAlphaGenome predicts how mutations interfere with the way genes are controlled, changing when they are switched on, in which cells of the body, and whether their biological volume controls are set to high or low.\n\nMost common diseases that run in families, including heart disease and autoimmune disorders, as well as mental health problems, have been linked to mutations that affect gene regulation, as have many cancers, but identifying which genetic glitches are to blame is far from straightforward.\n\n“We see AlphaGenome as a tool for understanding what the functional elements in the genome do, which we hope will accelerate our fundamental understanding of the code of life,” Natasha Latysheva, a DeepMind researcher, told a press briefing on the work.\n\nThe human genome runs to 3bn pairs of letters – the Gs, Ts, Cs and As that comprise the DNA code. About 2% of the genome tells cells how to make proteins, the building blocks of life. The rest orchestrates gene activity, carrying the crucial instructions that dictate where, when and how much individual genes are switched on.\n\nThe researchers trained AlphaGenome on public databases of human and mouse genetics, enabling it to learn connections between mutations in specific tissues and their impact on gene regulation. The AI can analyse up to 1m letters of DNA code at once and predict how mutations will affect different biological processes.\n\nThe DeepMind team believes the tool will help scientists map out which strands of genetic code are most essential for the development of particular tissues, such as nerve and liver cells, and pinpoint the most important mutations for driving cancer and other diseases. It could also underpin new gene therapies by allowing researchers to design entirely new DNA sequences – for example, to switch on a certain gene in nerve cells but not in muscle cells.\n\nCarl de Boer, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the work, said: “AlphaGenome can identify whether mutations affect genome regulation, which genes are impacted and how, and in what cell types. A drug could then be developed to counteract this effect.\n\n“Ultimately, our goal is to have models that are so good we don’t have to do an experiment to confirm their predictions. While AlphaGenome represents a significant innovation, achieving this goal will require continued work from the scientific community.”\n\nSome scientists have already begun using AlphaGenome. Marc Mansour, a clinical professor of paediatric haemato-oncology at UCL, said it marked a “step change” in his work to find genetic drivers for cancer.\n\nGareth Hawkes, a statistical geneticist at the University of Exeter, said: “The non-coding genome is 98% of our 3bn base pair genome. We understand the 2% fairly well, but the fact that we’ve got AlphaGenome that can make predictions of what this other 2.94bn base pair region is doing is a big step forward for us.”",

    "description": "Can't decide between Google and Samsung? Here's what you need to know.",
    "fullText": "If you're going to go with Android rather than an iPhone for your smartphone, then Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy handsets are the two most high-profile options you've got. There are other Android phones worth considering—from the likes of OnePlus and Nothing, for example—but Google and Samsung are the most well-known.\n\nWhile the fundamental operating system on Pixel and Galaxy phones is the same, there are numerous differences between these two flavors of Android. They're not all obvious, though, unless you spend every day with these handsets, and that can make it tricky to decide whether you're better off going with Google or Samsung.\n\nAs it happens, I use Pixel and Galaxy phones every day, more or less—not because tech journalists are particularly wealthy, but because we have to write a lot of reviews, news stories, and how-to guides for our jobs. Here's what I've learned along the way, and how you can choose between Pixel phones and Galaxy phones.\n\nIn the old days we used to talk about \"stock\" Android on Google's Nexus or Pixel phones, but that doesn't really exist any more: Even Google puts its own twists and tweaks on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that every Android manufacturer has access to. Samsung adds even more on top of the AOSP foundation, and markets its own take on Android as One UI.\n\nThere's no doubt that One UI on Galaxy phones is busier and more complex than Android on Pixel phones—which can either be a positive or a negative, depending on how you like your mobile software. Samsung offers more settings, customizations, and configurations than Google, so One UI is going to appeal to power users.\n\nGalaxy phones offer \n\nGoogle takes a simpler approach to the user interface—which you could praise as uncluttered or criticize as basic, depending on your perspective and taste. The Pixel version of Android has gotten a bit more polished over time, and has borrowed a few tricks from Samsung, but it's still not as customizable overall.\n\nWith Pixel phones, Google's apps are front and center. On a Galaxy phone, you get all of Google's key apps, and all of Samsung's equivalents, installed by default: So again, Galaxy phones are the more cluttered of the two. There's nothing wrong with Samsung's apps for photos, calendars, contacts, web browsing, and so on, but it's likely that most of the time you're going to prefer the Google option.\n\nThat might change depending on what else you own: If you have a Galaxy Watch strapped to your wrist, then Samsung Health becomes far more useful and interesting. If you've gone for a Pixel Watch, then you're going to prefer the Google-owned Fitbit. As with most tech purchases these days, from TVs to smart speakers to laptops, you'll need to consider what else you own from Google or Samsung.\n\nGoogle does keep some features as exclusives for Pixel phones, though they often trickle out to the wider Android ecosystem over time. At the moment, they include Call Screen (for putting a barrier between you and spam calls), the real-time Scam Detection feature, Pixel Screenshots for analyzing your screengrabs, a Now Playing widget for the home screen, and photo features such as Night Sight.\n\nIn some cases, Samsung has counterparts for those Pixel exclusives, and it has a few exclusives of its own that you don't get with Pixel phones. There's also the suite of Good Lock modules that take phone customization and tweaking to the next level: You can set different volume levels for different apps, design your own themes, and take more control over your home screen, for example.\n\nI don't want to talk too much about hardware differences, because these change regularly with each passing year (or even every six months), but there's no doubt that hardware design comes into play when you're choosing a smartphone—and broadly speaking, I think most people will agree that Samsung's phones are more sleek and stylish.\n\nAesthetics are subjective, but the Samsung Galaxy series look closer to the polish and refinement of the iPhones, whereas Google takes a more simplified and industrial approach to its Pixels: Look at that chunky rear camera bar for example (which to be fair does help when a phone is laid flat).\n\nPerformance is difficult to gauge, but it's fair to say that the Snapdragon (and even Exynos) chipsets that Samsung uses have a better reputation than the Tensor CPUs that Google puts in its Pixel phones. That said, there's an argument to be made that Google wins on camera lens quality, which is something the Galaxy series hasn't really moved the needle much on in recent years.\n\nWhat's indisputable is that Android updates roll out to Google phones several months before Samsung phones: Samsung needs time to adapt the AOSP code for its own One UI release, and so if you want to get the latest Android features before anyone else, the Pixel series is your best bet.\n\nIf I'm buying a new Android phone for myself, I'll still usually go with a Google Pixel. The software interface is a little more rudimentary, but I don't mind that, and I use so many Google apps so regularly—Gmail, Google Chat, Google Maps, Google Keep—that I want the most friction-free and seamless access to them possible. I don't want or need a bunch of Samsung apps too.\n\nThat's not to say Galaxy phones don't have their appeal, and I like tinkering around with some of the extra features and hacks you don't get with Pixels—like the secret wifi menu, for example, or the built-in easy mode. Ultimately, though, Pixels feel more intuitive and easier to use for me, and I absolutely want to be first in the queue for Android updates.\n\nAdmittedly, part of this is down to familiarity. I've been using Google phones more regularly for across a longer span of time than Samsung phones, and I'm used to them and the way they work—if you're a seasoned Galaxy phone owner, then the benefits of a Pixel probably won't have as much appeal, considering you're going to have to get used to a different set of options and menus.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every 'Google TV Streamer' User Should Know",
    "description": "These tweaks will help you declutter the home screen, sideload other apps, and ensure you never lose your remote again.",
    "fullText": "The launch of the Google TV Streamer marked a significant shift for the company's streaming lineup, moving away from the behind-the-TV Chromecast dongles it popularized and introducing a pill-shaped set-top box that blends in nicely on a shelf of tchotchkes. It's hiding a worthy processor, double the memory you'd get from a streaming stick, and enough storage to download what you need to run all of your apps. It even acts as a smart hub, with Matter and Thread built in.\n\nIt's taken me a long time to do anything with the Google TV Streamer. I reluctantly brought it into my home after realizing something more robust, but dated, like the Nvidia Shield, would be too much to manage alongside maintaining a home server. But since then, I've tweaked several things on the set-top box and enabled features I hadn't been using, turning it into a helpful hub in my living room.\n\nThis sounds like an obvious tip, but I've had the Google TV Streamer since it debuted in 2024, and it wasn't until this week, while writing this piece, that I finally enabled the remote finder. I had skipped it during the initial setup. The option is available in Settings > Remotes & Accessories. You'll see the Find my remote option in there.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer has a physical button on the back of the device that lets you locate your remote if it's stuck somewhere on the couch. But what if you can't reach the streamer behind the TV? Try one of your Google-enabled voice devices instead. If you have a Nest speaker or a Pixel phone nearby, say \"Hey Google, find my remote.\" The remote should start chirping if you've set it up.\n\nThe remotes that come with the Google TV Streamer feature a tiny, unregistered button with a star icon right next to the power button. By default, this shortcut does nothing! But you can change that in the device's system preferences.\n\nIn Settings > Remotes & Accessories > Set up remote buttons, select one of three options for customizing the shortcut button. I set it up as my Google Home shortcut so I can easily turn the lights on and off from the couch. You can also set it up as a launcher for another app installed on the set-top box. Or create a shortcut to cycle through device inputs—this button is on legacy Chromecast devices with an included remote. It was removed from this generation of streaming devices, so if you miss it, you can spoof it back.\n\nFor serious power users, map the shortcut to an app like Projectivity Launcher to make it a more powerful launcher button.\n\nDon't care for the default YouTube or Netflix buttons included on the Google TV Streamer remote? You can remap them with a third-party app, then affix a small sticker to indicate what it does. Install an app like Button Mapper or tvQuickActions. Then go to Google TV Settings > System > Accessibility, and turn on the service. After that, you can head back into the app to adjust what those physical buttons do. You can set them as shortcuts to other apps, or even something cheekier for others to discover when they press the button.\n\nCan't stand all the recommendations and sponsored content Google TV suggests in the main carousel? You can effectively shut off some of the clutter so it doesn't visually overwhelm you. Go to Settings > Accounts & Sign-In > Your Account. and toggle on Apps only mode.\n\nThis clears the clutter and \"sponsored\" content, leaving you with just app icons. Keep in mind that this turns off the \"Watchlist\" feature that's tied to your account and some Gemini voice search capabilities for specific content.\n\nYou'll need to enable developer options to enable features like faster animations and side-loading apps. It's easy to set up, and it's just like on an Android smartphone. Head into Settings > System > About, then tap Android TV OS Build 7 times.\n\nYou'll see a little dialog pop up to let you know you've got developer access. Once enabled, a new menu will appear under Settings > System > Developer options.\n\nThe Google TV interface is organized and functional, but its animations can slow down menu navigation. You can eliminate these animations and tweak other visual elements to speed things up deep within the developer settings.\n\nIn Developer Options, scroll down to Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Change one of these, or all three, from 1x to Animation off to turn off animations completely. You can also go the other way and effectively \"overclock\" the animations to speed them up, making them appear smoother.\n\nWith developer options turned on, you can enable USB and wireless debugging to use apps like Send Files to TV and atvTools to sideload APKs. But first, enable the \"Allow installs from unknown sources\" option in the Developer Options under Security settings. This allows APKs you've transferred over to the device to run on the streamer.\n\nWhy would you want to go through the fuss of connecting to the Google TV Streamer this way? Because then you could access alternative streaming apps not available in the Play Store, or even an alternative launcher, like LeanbackLauncher.\n\nThis is one of my favorite little hacks that comes especially in handy when living in a house occupied by other people. When I do my workouts in the living room, I use a set of Bluetooth earbuds connected to the Google TV Streamer so I can hear the instructor's directions even when I'm face down in a plank and my kid is screaming in the background.\n\nThe ability is available in the same submenu where you set up your remote. In Settings > Remote & Accessories > Pair Remote/Accessory, put your audio device into Bluetooth pairing mode, then watch it come up on the screen as an option. If you're successful, you can now pop on the buds when you need to. Be aware that audio latency can occur, and you might need to restart the connection—it is Bluetooth, after all.\n\nIf you don't care about your bandwidth and want full-resolution streaming at all times, you can set the best resolution to display as the default in your Google TV Streamer preferences. Go to Settings > Display & Sound > Resolution. Switch the Resolution from \"Automatic\" to 4K 60Hz, or whatever your TV's peak is. Once this is enabled, the Google TV Streamer won't downscale to 1080p. If you're a sucker for HDR, this is the same menu where you can turn it on so that it's always in high definition.\n\nThe USB-C port can do more than charge up the Google TV Streamer. You can plug in a power delivery hub with extra ports to add components like external storage and effectively run your own all-in-one home media center. Those power delivery hubs usually include extra USB ports for peripherals, so you can hook up things like keyboards and game controllers for extra fun.",

    "fullText": "Back in 2024 Google rolled out their Axion in-house ARM processors with the Google Cloud C4A instance type. Today they are expanding their Axion offerings in Google Cloud with the N4A instances now out of preview. The Google Cloud N4A instances are designed for scale-out web servers and microservices, containerized applications, back-end application services, databases, data analytics, and cost-effective development/staging/testing environments.\n\nGoogle Cloud N4A instances have been in preview since the end of 2025 while today reached GA state. Compared to the C4A instances that allow up to 72 vCPUs and 576GB of RAM and 100 Gbps networking, the more cost-effective N4A instances are available up to 64 vCPUs, 512GB of RAM, and 50 Gbps networking. Like C4A, the N4A instances do have high memory (1:8 vCPU to memory) and high CPU (1:2 vCPU to memory) options to complement the standard 1:4 ratio for vCPU to memory size.\n\nThe Google Axion CPUs powering the N4A VMs remain on Arm Neoverse N3 cores and paired with Google's Titanium IPU. N4A VMs operate within a single node for uniform memory access.\n\nFor getting an idea for the Google Axion performance with the new N4A instances, Google kindly provided some free access in advance of today's GA date for some preview testing. To see the performance of Google N4A, using the 16 vCPU standard size I ran dozens of benchmarks comparing it to the prior-generation Tau T2A that is considered their prior-generation VM to the N4A series. Google Cloud T2A is powered by Ampere Altra processors based on Neoverse-N1 cores, now with N4A jumping ahead to Neoverse-N3.\n\nUbuntu 25.10 AArch64 was run on both the N4A and T2A 16 vCPU standard instances for looking at how the N4A performance is and how the ARM performance in Google Cloud has advanced since the T2A introduction back in 2022.\n\nPricing as of writing for the N4A-standard-16 size with 400GB of storage was $0.71 hourly or about $517.68 per month. The T2A-standard-16 with 400GB of storage was $0.64 hourly or $465.68 per month.",

    "description": "Google is bringing the conversation right into Search, letting users ask follow-up questions to AI Overviews on mobile.",
    "fullText": "Google Search's AI makeover continues.\n\nThe company said that, starting today, mobile users will be able to ask follow-up questions to AI Overviews, Google's AI-generated search summaries. Doing so will launch users into a back-and-forth with AI Mode, its more conversational take on search that already lives in a separate tab on the search page.\n\nAfter Google's AI Overviews awkwardly stumbled out the gate in 2024 (pizza glue, anyone?) they've gradually become a staple of the Search experience.\n\nHowever, until now, users have only been able to back-and-forth with Google's AI models by going directly to AI Mode or using Google's Gemini chatbot. Now, on mobile, users will be able to tap an \"Ask anything\" text box that will let them ask further questions.\n\n\"In our testing, we've found that people prefer an experience that flows naturally into a conversation — and that asking follow-up questions while keeping the context from AI Overviews makes Search more helpful,\" said Robby Stein, the VP of product for Google Search.\n\nGoogle began testing the new feature on mobile late last year. Some publishers took umbrage with it at the time, voicing concerns that it would further reduce clicks to websites.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, the CEO of the nonprofit Fairly Trained AI, took a jab at an X post by Stein announcing the test in December, writing: \"…and you shouldn't have to visit any of the websites Google has scraped the information from.\"\n\nGoogle's AI search transformation has left some publishers frustrated and confused by changes that give users answers directly, often negating the need to click through to a website.\n\nGoogle has argued that it's seeing more queries than ever before, and that it's sending \"higher quality clicks\" as a result of the AI-related changes it's making to Search.\n\nThe difference between those two things is important. Higher-quality clicks mean a user is more likely to have landed where they want to be and less likely to immediately leave, Google's head of Search, Elizabeth Reid, has previously said. She has also said that the changes have affected user journeys, leading to some sites seeing decreased traffic.\n\nGoogle's latest update won't allay those fears, but it does suggest Google is moving to a world where the differences between AI Mode, AI Overviews, and its Gemini chatbot are less obvious.\n\nBenjamin Kaufman, product manager for AI Mode at Google, hinted at such last year, responding to a comment on X that criticized Google's many different search modes.\n\n\"Yeah hopefully soon those distinctions start to feel like they fade away and you just ask Google anything and get what you need!\" he wrote.\n\nThe update could get more people engaging with AI Mode, which Google has been nudging users toward. The company also said Tuesday it's making Gemini 3, its latest AI model, the default model for AI Overviews globally.\n\nGoogle has a significant distribution advantage over its competitors, with billions of queries sent to Google Search every day. That, along with the success of its latest Gemini 3 model, has helped the company pull off an impressive turnaround over the last year, and saw Google crack a $4 trillion market cap earlier this month.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "A former Google and Meta employee shares why he left Big Tech and how he got comfortable making the leap to entrepreneurship.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jason White, a 46-year-old startup founder in the San Jose area. Business Insider has verified his former employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've spent half of my 20 years in the tech industry working at Google and Meta. These companies allowed me to work on some amazing projects, but I've now resigned from them both.\n\nI joined Google in 2016 as a tech lead in the Gmail division and transitioned to the Google Search team in 2020. By 2024, I realized I wanted to lean more heavily into AI. I didn't feel my position at Google would give me the opportunity to do that, so I opened myself up to other opportunities.\n\nWhen a Meta recruiter reached out about an AI machine learning engineer role, I decided to pursue it and eventually received an offer. I left Google in July 2024 and started at Meta a month later.\n\nI had a positive experience at Meta. I worked with great people in a high-resource environment and learned a lot. I was also able to lean into AI as I'd hoped, focusing fully on AI products.\n\nHowever, halfway through 2025, I started thinking about resigning to build a startup — specifically, a venture that would use AI to help the typical household with their finances.\n\nWhether to resign from Meta was a complex decision.\n\nThe startup was something I was growing increasingly passionate about. I know what financial pressure feels like — I had been a low-paid graduate student trying to provide for a newborn.\n\nMany people don't have access to great financial planning and management tools to help improve their financial situations. While I was still figuring out what the business would look like, I felt there was an opportunity to help people, and that was very motivating for me.\n\nI connected with a potential cofounder — a friend of a friend — and we spent a lot of time talking through the opportunity. That helped me grow more comfortable with the idea of leaving Meta, but there were still a lot of other factors to consider.\n\nIt's hard to leave a world-class team with people you like — not to mention a reliable source of income.\n\nI know some people start businesses on the side while keeping their full-time jobs, but I couldn't do that because I was already juggling two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nMy other concern was legal. I would've had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues — especially since my business idea was related to AI, like my role at Meta.\n\nI wanted to make sure my family had enough savings to cover at least one year of our current expenses without touching our retirement accounts. My wife works, but I wanted a cushion in case she lost her job. I figured that would give me at least one year to build the business, and, if things went really badly, enough time afterward to find a job.\n\nWe already were in a good place savings-wise, so we were still able to take vacations, hire tutors for our kids, and order DoorDash. I had about six months before resigning to make some minor adjustments, including cutting back on 401(k) contributions and putting more money into liquid savings accounts.\n\nThis financial planning process for my family really helped crystallize the direction I wanted to go with the startup. In September 2025, I resigned from Meta.\n\nWhen I shared the news with my colleagues, the response was a mix of surprise, support, and a large amount of jealousy. A lot of people want to leave and start their own thing, but for various reasons they can't or won't — whether it's because of their visa status, financial constraints, or broader fear.\n\nI'm now focused on my business, Bear Financial. My cofounder and I are planning to publicly launch in the second half of this year. We may seek external funding, but for now, we're bootstrapping the business, so I've tracked our spending very carefully.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice for people considering leaving their jobs to start their own business. First, get your finances in order. Second, make sure anyone who depends on you, like your family, is supportive of the decision — I was fortunate to have a supportive partner who knew that I felt limited working in Big Tech.\n\nThird, choose an idea you deeply believe in. With a startup, you have to be the one to bring the energy, the enthusiasm, the vision — and to carry others into it.\n\nAddress your knowledge gaps. Startup founders often need to be generalists, which means having a basic understanding of a lot of areas.\n\nI'd also suggest envisioning the worst-case outcome and asking yourself whether you'd be OK with it. I thought about what it would look like one year later if my business failed. I believe I'd still value everything I learned over those 12 months.\n\nIf I eventually decide to pursue a corporate position again, I have faith that I'd be able to find something — even though it's hard to predict what the job market will look like.\n\nThere are, however, a lot of potential barriers to success: we have to navigate a moving target on regulations, we need to figure out ways to convince potential customers to give us a try, and there are super well-resourced companies that could become direct competitors.\n\nAt the end of the day, I want to take the swing.",

    "fullText": "Recevez tous les soirs un résumé de l’actu importante avec Le Récap’\n\n« Souveraineté numérique » : dans un communiqué de presse envoyé le 26 janvier 2026, le Ministère chargé de la fonction publique et de la réforme de l’État annonce la couleur. Son projet : généraliser Visio, un outil de visioconférence conçu pour sevrer la France, et plus généralement l’Europe, de sa dépendance aux géants américains.\n\nAlors que Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype ou WebEx règnent en maîtres absolus sur nos réunions virtuelles depuis des années, le gouvernement, par la voix de David Amiel, ministre délégué chargé de la Fonction publique, officialise la généralisation de son alternative maison. D’ici 2027, l’ensemble des services de l’État auront l’obligation d’utiliser Visio.\n\nDéveloppé par la Direction interministérielle du numérique (DINUM), Visio coche toutes les cases de la souveraineté. Il ne s’agit pas d’une simple copie française de Zoom, mais d’un logiciel conçu avec plusieurs couches françaises.\n\nCôté hébergement, les données seront stockées chez Outscale, filiale de Dassault Systèmes, qui bénéficie du très strict label SecNumCloud de l’ANSSI. C’est la garantie que les données ne sont pas soumises aux lois extraterritoriales américaines. Visio intègrera aussi plusieurs fonctionnalités IA comme :\n\nActuellement testé par 40 000 utilisateurs, Visio va monter en puissance. Le CNRS, l’Assurance Maladie ou encore le ministère des Armées basculeront sur l’outil dès le premier trimestre 2026.\n\nVisio est déjà disponible aujourd’hui, mais est réservé à certains métiers publics, comme l’enseignement. Le gouvernement ne dit pas s’il ouvrira un jour sa solution souveraine au grand public.\n\nL’initiative est louable, mais le défi est immense. Aujourd’hui, l’administration française, comme le reste du monde, vit sous perfusion numérique américaine. Les systèmes d’exploitation, les suites bureautiques et même les messageries instantanées utilisées au sommet de l’État (on pense à WhatsApp, malgré les interdictions régulières) créent une dépendance systémique aux États-Unis et à leurs géants.\n\nLa réalité du terrain est souvent celle de la facilité : Teams est inclus dans la suite Microsoft 365, Zoom est devenu un verbe du langage courant et Google Meet fonctionne avec un simple lien. Tenter de déloger ces outils ne sera pas aisé : les habitudes sont difficiles à bouleverser. L’État français dispose d’autres alternatives déjà crédibles, notamment sur la messagerie sécurisée avec des solutions comme Tchap ou Olvid, mais il s’agit de solutions très confidentielles.\n\nMalgré cette réalité des usages, la bataille semble aujourd’hui difficilement critiquable. Laisser les conversations stratégiques du ministère des Armées ou les travaux du CNRS transiter par des serveurs étrangers pose un risque de sécurité évident. La dépendance stratégique vis-à-vis d’infrastructures externes fragilise l’État en cas de conflit diplomatique ou commercial : Donald Trump a le pouvoir de paralyser les administrations européennes s’il le souhaite. L’inverse n’est pas vrai.\n\nAutre élément mis en avant par Bercy : le coût. Selon Bercy, l’arrêt des licences payantes aux géants américains permettrait d’économiser 1 million d’euros par an pour chaque tranche de 100 000 utilisateurs.\n\nEn plus de cette annonce sur la vidéoconférence, d’autres chantiers commencent à voir le jour à échelle européenne. Parmi eux : les réseaux de paiement. Aujourd’hui, Visa et Mastercard ont un droit de vie ou de mort sur les transactions commerciales du continent. Un blocage pourrait être fatal pour l’économie européenne, même s’il est aujourd’hui hautement hypothétique.\n\nÀ l’avenir, l’Europe pourrait développer son propre réseau de paiement pour permettre des paiements dans la zone sans passer par VISA et MasterCard. Certains pays disposent déjà de leurs propres réseaux souverains (c’est le cas de CB en France), mais il n’existe pas de solution universelle. L’initiative Wero, à base de QR code, ouvre la porte à des nouveaux paiements hors des rails américains.\n\nToute l'actu tech en un clin d'œil\n\nAjoutez Numerama à votre écran d'accueil et restez connectés au futur !\n\nTous nos articles sont aussi sur notre profil Google : suivez-nous pour ne rien manquer !",

    "title": "Microsoft says its newest AI chip Maia 200 is 3 times more powerful than Google's TPU and Amazon's Trainium processor",
    "description": "The Maia 200 AI chip is described as an inference powerhouse — meaning it could lead AI models to apply their knowledge to real-world situations much faster and more efficiently.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMicrosoft has revealed its new Maia 200 accelerator chip for artificial intelligence (AI) that is three times more powerful than hardware from rivals like Google and Amazon, company representatives say.\n\nThis newest chip will be used in AI inference rather than training, powering systems and agents used to make predictions, provide answers to queries and generate outputs based on new data that's fed to them.\n\nMaia 200 is already being deployed in Microsoft's U.S. central data center region, with the company set to use the chips to generate synthetic data and in reinforcement training to improve next-generation large language models (LLMs). The AI accelerator will also be used to power Microsoft Foundry and 365 Copilot AI, and be part of the infrastructure that the company can provide through its Azure cloud platform.\n\nThe new chip delivers performance of more than 10 petaflops (1015 floating point operations per second), Scott Guthrie, cloud and AI executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post. This is a measure of performance in supercomputing, where the most powerful supercomputers in the world can reach more than 1,000 petaflops of power.\n\nThe new chip achieved this performance level in a data representation category known as \"4-bit precision (FP4)\" — a highly compressed model designed to accelerate AI performance. Maia 200 also delivers 5 PFLOPS of performance in 8-bit precision (FP8). The difference between the two is that FP4 is far more energy efficient but less accurate.\n\n\"In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today’s largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,\" Guthrie said in the blog post. \"This means Maia 200 delivers 3 times the FP4 performance of the third generation Amazon Trainium, and FP8 performance above Google’s seventh generation TPU.\"\n\nMaia 200 could potentially be used for specialist AI workloads, such as running larger LLMs in the future. So far, Microsoft's Maia chips have only been used in the Azure cloud infrastructure to run large-scale workloads for Microsoft’s own AI services, notably Copilot. However, Guthrie noted there would be \"wider customer availability in the future,\" signaling other organizations could tap into Maia 200 via the Azure cloud, or the chips could potentially one day be deployed in standalone data centers or server stacks.\n\nGuthrie said that Microsoft boasts 30% better performance per dollar over existing systems thanks to the use of the 3-nanometer process made by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the most important fabricator in the world, allowing for 100 billion transistors per chip. This essentially means that Maia 200 could be more cost-effective and efficient for the most demanding AI workloads than existing chips.\n\nMaia 200 has a few other features alongside better performance and efficiency. It includes a memory system, for instance, which can help keep an AI model’s weights and data local, meaning you would need less hardware to run a model. It's also designed to be quickly integrated into existing data centers.\n\nMaia 200 should enable AI models to run faster and more efficiently. This means Azure OpenAI users, such as scientists, developers and corporations, could see better throughput and speeds when developing AI applications and using the likes of GPT-4 in their operations.\n\n—'It won’t be so much a ghost town as a zombie apocalypse': How AI might forever change how we use the internet\n\n— GPT-4 has passed the Turing test, researchers claim\n\n—The more advanced AI models get, the better they are at deceiving us — they even know when they're being tested\n\nThis next-generation AI hardware is unlikely to disrupt everyday AI and chatbot use for most people in the short term, as Maia 200 is designed for data centers rather than consumer-grade hardware. However, end users could see the impact of Maia 200 in the form of faster response times and potentially more advanced features from Copilot and other AI tools built into Windows and Microsoft products.\n\nMaia 200 could also provide a performance boost to developers and scientists who use AI inference via Microsoft’s platforms. This, in turn, could lead to improvements in AI deployment on large-scale research projects and elements like advanced weather modeling, biological or chemical systems and compositions.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft (MSFT) is taking aim at cloud rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with the debut of its next-generation custom AI chip.\n\nCalled Maia 200, the chip will run in Microsoft’s own data centers before the company eventually makes it available to its wider customer base.\n\nLike Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium processors, Microsoft’s second AI chip is meant to give the Windows maker more flexibility when it comes to how it powers its AI services. By using its own internally developed chips, the company ensures it doesn’t have to rely solely on processors developed by Nvidia (NVDA) or AMD (AMD).\n\nGoogle and Amazon have been using their own custom chips for years, while Microsoft has been slower to adopt in-house AI silicon.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the Maia 200 will be built using TSMC’s 3-nanometer process and is designed to run large-scale AI workloads, while “delivering efficient performance per dollar.”\n\nThe Maia 200 will be built into large server racks with trays housing four chips each. Microsoft is also touting how quickly it can deploy the new chips into data centers, saying chips are installed and running AI models within days of parts arriving.\n\nGetting AI servers up and running quickly is an important aspect of the broader data center business. It’s not just a matter of keeping construction costs down, either. The longer a chip goes unused, the less cash it can generate for the company by running AI apps.\n\nThe Maia 200 adds to the growing competition Nvidia is facing from both AMD and its own customers. Microsoft’s Maia 100 already powers both the company’s and OpenAI’s (OPAI.PVT) AI models, while Google and Amazon both power their respective models and Anthropic’s (ANTH.PVT) models.\n\nAnd in November, The Information reported that Meta was talking to Google about using the search giant’s TPUs in its own data centers to power its AI services. That sent Nvidia stock down at the time, as Wall Street raised fears that the company was in danger of losing market share.\n\nNvidia’s stock price is up less than 1% since the start of the year.\n\nDespite the incursions into Nvidia’s lane, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the AI leader. Experts say that while the cloud company’s AI chips may function well for their own services, that’s not likely to translate to smaller third-party customers as easily.\n\nNvidia’s chips are also highly coveted because they are designed to be multipurpose, allowing companies to use them for a litany of applications and services.\n\nAs for performance, the Maia 200 won’t unseat Nvidia, but Microsoft claims it outpaces both Google’s latest TPU and Amazon’s newest Trainium chip in a number of categories. The Maia 200 also packs more high-bandwidth memory than Google’s or Amazon’s offerings, which is key to running high-powered AI applications.",

    "description": "For Jack Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI is  an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences.",
    "fullText": "Tony Stark relied on his ultra-polished, tech-heavy \"Iron Man\" suit to achieve his superhero feats.\n\nJack Buser, the global director for games at Google Cloud, thinks AI will help game developers in the same way.\n\n\"There will always be holdouts, just like every technological revolution, but it's becoming so common now,\" Buser told Business Insider. \"We're seeing a major shift.\"\n\nBuser and other tech industry leaders have said that implementing AI could transform how people work. In the gaming industry, the tech could help streamline operations, resulting in cost cuts, faster production times, or help developers tackle an array of tasks.\n\n\"It's like the Iron Man suit of armor, right? It's still you inside the suit of armor, but you're suddenly able to do things that you couldn't do before,\" Buser said. \"If you armor everybody up in your studio with suits that allow them to work more quickly and remove the drudgery, that tends to be well received after it's been implemented.\"\n\nBuser urged executives at studios and companies to take the lead by giving developers the necessary tools.\n\n\"If you're the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it's safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can't do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,\" Buser said.\n\n\"It has as much to do with getting these tools up and running in your development pipelines as it does working culturally with your company to help it make that transformation,\" he added.\n\nGetting comfortable with AI, he said, shouldn't be confined to developers alone.\n\n\"It can be tricky at the executive level. You don't have a crystal ball of where this is all going,\" he said. \"It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn't do.\"\n\nMany global industries are undergoing a technological shift driven by advances in AI. Companies are increasingly adopting the tech in their workflows, which some critics say could diminish job prospects for humans. Supporters argue it's a powerful tool that can help workers do their jobs better and faster.\n\nFor Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI has created an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences. At Google, that means embracing the era of \"living games.\"\n\nThe live games model, in which developers continue to add new content to a game after its initial release, is already common. AI, however, could make living games more adaptable, personalized, and immersive. The AI could also shorten update turnaround time, making the transition for players more seamless.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're looking at things like real-time game experiences,\" Buser said.\n\nFor now, though, the gaming industry will be focused on scaling and normalizing the tech.\n\n\"2026 is where companies start to scale these efforts,\" Buser said. \"Game developers who were using AI in one or two parts of their development workflow will suddenly be using it throughout their workflow. You'll start to see games that are using multiple AI-based features that are affecting the player experience.\"",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: German research into responses to health queries raises fresh questions about summaries seen by 2bn people a month\n\nHow the ‘confident authority’ of AI Overviews is putting public health at risk\n\nGoogle’s search feature AI Overviews cites YouTube more than any medical website when answering queries about health conditions, according to research that raises fresh questions about a tool seen by 2 billion people each month.\n\nThe company has said its AI summaries, which appear at the top of search results and use generative AI to answer questions from users, are “reliable” and cite reputable medical sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHowever, a study that analysed responses to more than 50,000 health queries, captured using Google searches from Berlin, found the top cited source was YouTube. The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.\n\nResearchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.\n\nThe research comes after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.\n\nIn one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company later removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.\n\nThe SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.\n\nThey chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,” they wrote.\n\nAI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.\n\nThe next most cited source was NDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site, Msdmanuals.com with 9,711 citations (2.08%).\n\nThe fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal, Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors, Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.\n\nResults could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.\n\nHannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.\n\n“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”\n\nGoogle said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.\n\n“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,” the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.\n\n“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”",

    "fullText": "Do I have the flu or Covid? Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers. Google those health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.\n\nWith the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,” Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.\n\nBut overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.\n\nWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US, users encountered untruths across a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president, graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search, responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.\n\nBut when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries after a Guardian investigation found people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.\n\nThe company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. But the Guardian found some medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.\n\nIn another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.\n\nAI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.\n\nGoogle initially sought to downplay the Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.\n\nWithin days, however, the company removed some of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”\n\nWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.\n\n“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.\n\nA new study has prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately. The single most cited domain was YouTube.\n\n“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,” the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”\n\nIn medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.\n\n“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such as YouTube videos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”\n\nGoogle says AI Overviews are built to surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.\n\nBut the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.\n\n“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”\n\nExperts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.\n\nHaving such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.\n\nGoogle told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.\n\nThe biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”",

    "title": "My career path to Google included bartending and working at a nursing home. Here's what it taught me.",
    "description": "Milica Cvetkovic, said that getting her current job at Google was like training for a marathon — and she wouldn't change much about her journey.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Milica Cvetkovic, a 35-year-old senior technical solutions consultant at Google, based in Chicago. Her identity and employment have been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been working on building AI systems for Google Cloud customers for about three years, but my path to get there was a little non-traditional.\n\nI'm not one of those people who applied to Google 100 times. I took a lot of different routes along the way. My career journey has been wild. \n\nI improvised; I had moments when I was poor without health insurance; I had moments when I was lonely and helpless; I had moments when I messed up and was scared. But I also met the most magical people and had the best adventures. Regardless of how hard it was, I would change very little.\n\nI was born and raised in Serbia, and moved to the US when I was 18. Instead of going to law school in Serbia, I took a gap year, bartended, and then went to college and majored in math.\n\nAfter college, I moved to downtown Chicago and became a bartender. I love bartending. If I had time, I would do it now. Then I moved to New Orleans and worked as a shot girl on Bourbon Street for a while.\n\nNext, I moved to Columbus and worked as a caregiver at a nursing home, which was probably one of the lowest moments of my life. I moved to Columbus, where I knew nobody, and where it was hard to meet new people. Working in the nursing home exposed me to seeing people die for the first time.\n\nThese experiences taught me that discipline matters a lot. When people say you have to work hard, that means you have to have discipline. I am not one of those people who were brought up with this hardcore discipline — I had to build it myself.\n\nEventually, I found a role somewhat related to what I studied and became a curriculum designer at McGraw-Hill Education for four or five years. At some point, I visited friends in Madison, Wisconsin, and decided I wanted to live there.\n\nSo I moved there and started grad school for statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The whole time I was in grad school, I continued working remotely for McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nIn grad school, I began researching how to teach machine learning to nontechnical audiences, specifically computational biologists. That experience, combined with my education in curriculum design, opened a lot of doors for me in education.\n\nDuring my last semester of grad school, I started an internship as a machine learning engineer with a local startup in Madison that was using a device to predict animal health. I ended up working there full-time after grad school and also started teaching, first in bootcamps and eventually at the university level.\n\nAt some point, I didn't want to code 24/7 anymore. I felt like my soft skills weren't being utilized enough. Around that time, I saw that Google had posted my current job, and it was a perfect fit.\n\nI think it's very valuable to have the skill to talk about technical concepts in a way that people are going to understand. The most incredible talks I've heard from accomplished scientists are from those who can talk about their research in an interesting and non-technical way.\n\nYou don't have to kill people with terminology and keywords to make a point. A lot of times when people do that, their audience gets confused. So I think having that ability is probably the most valuable skill that I bring.\n\nI had failures along the way. It's not like everything went smoothly. I'm an immigrant, and for most of the time, I was alone in all of this. I've been through some really stressful situations.\n\nWhen I started teaching at the university level, I worked very hard to get there, and I finally did, but I was super sick. Instead of being upfront about that, I ended up in the ER twice during that class, and I didn't deliver the way I wanted.\n\nYou have to move on in those moments. When you fail, you do damage control, and if the damage control doesn't work, you move on and do better next time.\n\nPeople come from different backgrounds and situations. You don't have to hustle and have 17 different things you do in order to get a Big Tech job. You can be excellent in just one thing; it just turns out I had all those interests.\n\nThere wasn't one experience that made me get the job — it was everything. I worked in education; I was an engineer; I was technical; I had the degrees that mattered; I could speak to non-technical audiences; I had work experience; and I was active in the tech community.\n\nAs someone who ran a marathon, I can say that getting the job at Google was like training for the marathon. The marathon itself is more of a celebration of all the work that you've already done. That's what my application to Google was.",

    "description": "If you have an older Mac, your time with Chrome may be ending.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever, and technology is no exception. As shiny and new as your computer was when you first bought it, eventually, developers will drop support for it. There's no telling when exactly, but at some point, you'll open an app to find a message that reads something like: \"This device does not support the latest version of this app. Please update your hardware.\"\n\nThat goes for Macs, as well. You might forget that fact, since Apple's computers tend to stick around for a long time. But inevitably, the shadow of end-of-life policies comes for them, too. If you're still rocking an older Mac, I have some bad news, specifically if you use Chrome: Google is officially planning its last supported version of the browser.\n\nGoogle quietly announced the news in a post on the Chrome Platform Status site. The company confirmed that Chrome 150 will be the last version of the browser to support macOS 12, otherwise known as macOS Monterey. Once Google eventually releases Chrome 151, users on macOS 12 will not be able to install it, and will forever be stuck on Chrome 150. Google hasn't said when Chrome 150 will actually drop (we're currently on Chrome 143), but MacRumors estimates it'll be sometime in mid-2026, based on past releases.\n\nBefore you panic, know there are a couple caveats here. First, Chrome will not stop working on macOS 12 once version 151 drops. You'll still be able to use Chrome as you always have. In fact, you might not even notice the difference, minus any new features and changes that Google rolls out in future software versions. You will see an alert that your browser is out of date, but it'll still get you to YouTube, Gmail, and Lifehacker.\n\nThis version of macOS is also fairly outdated. Google isn't just picking last year's macOS version, or the one before that. We're currently on macOS 26, which for these purposes, could be read as macOS 16. It's the fourth version of macOS since Monterey, meaning unless you know your Mac is running macOS 12, there's a good chance you're running something that Chrome still supports.\n\nIf you aren't sure, click the Apple in the top-left corner, then choose \"About This Mac.\" Here, you'll find the macOS version next to \"macOS.\"\n\nLet's say your Mac is running macOS 12. If so, you really should stop using Chrome once version 151 drops. That's because you'll no longer receive Google's latest security updates for the browser, which puts your machine (and its data) at risk.\n\nOnce Chrome 150 drops, bad actors will look for security vulnerabilities in the code to exploit. Google will do the same, and will patch any it or any third-party researchers find. Once 151 comes out, it'll include those patches, but Chrome 150 users will be left behind. The risk only grows as new vulnerabilities are discovered, and new versions of Chrome come out.\n\nAs such, you have a couple of options if you're running macOS 12. The first is to update your OS, if you have that choice. If your Mac does support macOS 13 or newer, updating will open you up to new versions of Chrome. Of course, perhaps the reason you're running macOS 12 is because you cannot update. While that largely affects Macs that are at least 10 years old, there are still plenty of these machines out there. There are alternative ways to update your older Mac, even if Apple won't let you, such as with OpenCore Legacy Patcher, but that might be too technical a route for some.\n\nThe other option here is to stop using Chrome, and switch to a browser that does support macOS 12. Firefox, for example, supports macOS 10.15 or later, and Microsoft Edge fully supports macOS 12 and later. (Safari itself hasn't been updated on macOS 12 since July 2024.)\n\nIt isn't fun watching your tech grow old, but you don't need to chuck your Mac just because Chrome will end support this year—even if the newest ones are really good.",

    "title": "Google's AI-Generated Headlines Are Here to Stay",
    "description": "That clickbait title might have been written by AI.",
    "fullText": "Last month, Google told online publishers that it had started testing AI-generated headlines in Google Discover, replacing stories' carefully handcrafted titles with truncated alternatives made up by Gemini. Some journalists were predictably unhappy, but now, the company says that the AI headlines are no longer an experiment—they're a \"feature.\"\n\nBack when the testing began, the results ranged from poorly worded to straight up misinformation. For instance, one AI-generated headline promised \"Steam Machine price revealed,\" when the original article made no such claim. Another said \"BG3 players exploit children,\" which sounds serious, until you click through to the article and see that it's about a clever way to recruit invincible party members in Baldur's Gate 3 (which, to be fair, does involve turning child NPCs into sheep at one point).\n\nAt the time, Google said that the test was a \"small UI experiment for a subset of Discover users,\" and simply rearranged how users saw AI previews, which were introduced in October of last year and feature short AI summaries of articles, including an occasional AI headline. However, while that AI headline was previously hidden below the original, authored headline, the test put it up top, while getting rid of the authored headline entirely.\n\nFor a while, it seemed like Google might have been willing to back away from the AI headlines, but now the company says it's doubling down. In a statement to The Verge, Google said that its AI headlines are no longer in testing, but are now a full-fledged feature. The company didn't elaborate on why, but did say that the update \"performs well for user satisfaction.\"\n\nWhen 9to5Google then reached out for more detail, the publication was told, \"The overview headline reflects information across a range of sites, and is not a rewrite of an individual article headline.\"\n\nWell, that hasn't quite been the case for me: When I first wrote about this \"experiment,\" I actually had yet to run into one of the AI headlines. But perusing my Google Discover feed today (to see yours, swipe right from the home screen on an Android phone, or scroll down in the Google app), I've finally seen some first hand. To Google's credit, these AI previews do seem to synthesize several sources as claimed—you can see them above the linked story. However, they still call out one article in particular, linking to it and using its header photo. That can easily lead users to think the AI generated headline was written by the linked publication.\n\nThat can have consequences for the publication or writer if the AI gets something wrong, which a disclaimer at the bottom of these AI previews admits can happen. For instance, The Verge said it saw an AI Discover headline on a story from Lifehacker's sister site PCMag that said, \"US reverses foreign drone ban,\" even though the linked story goes out of its way to say headlines that claim this are \"misleading.\"\n\nThe AI headlines I've seen personally haven't been quite that bad, but as someone with a more than decade-long career in journalism, I do question their helpfulness. For instance, \"Starfleet Academy full of Trek Nods\" is much less informative than the original, \"One of TNG's Strangest Species Is Getting a Second Life In Modern Star Trek.\" I guess \"Star Trek show has Star Trek things\" is apparently clickier or more useful to the reader than just saying what the specific Star Trek thing is?\n\nAnother example: \"Anbernic unveils RG G01 Controller.\" I hope you know what those letters and numbers mean, because this AI headline completely buries the context in the original headline, \"Anbernic's New Controller Has a Screen and Built-In Heartbeat Sensor, for Some Reason.\"\n\nI guess this is a future that I'll have to get used to though. That I'm starting to see these headlines myself, despite not being part of the initial experiment, does suggest we can expect them to stick around, and to roll out to more people. If you see something that seems questionable while scrolling Google Discover, the feature has probably rolled out to you now too.\n\nTo check whether that suspicious headline was written by a human or not, try clicking the \"See more\" button at the bottom of the article's description and looking for a \"Generated with AI\" disclaimer.\n\nOn the plus side, only about half of the articles in my Google Discover are currently using AI headlines, so not every piece of \"content\" is being affected. But for journalists, the move still comes at a tough time: According to Reuters, Google traffic from organic search was down by 38% on test sites in the United Stated between November 2024 and November 2025, and while Google Discover isn't Search, editors write headlines the way they do for a reason. Using a robot to overwrites those decisions probably isn't the best way to tackle eroding trust in media.\n\nI've reached out to Google for comment on its AI headlines and will provide an update when I hear back.",

    "description": "Personal Intelligence from Google connects Gemini AI to Gmail, Photos, and Search history, setting new standards for personal AI assistants.",
    "fullText": "Google rolled out a powerful new feature to AI Mode in Search this week. It's called Personal Intelligence, and it weaves together many of the company's existing services in a radical new way.\n\nThis was also launched recently in Gemini, Google's AI chatbot. Business Insider's Pranav Dixit tried it and was blown away. Here's his review:\n\nPersonal Intelligence feels like Google has been quietly taking notes on my entire life and finally decided to hand me the notebook.\n\nWith my permission, Gemini can tap into my Google account — Gmail, Photos, Search history, YouTube, and more — and reason across all of it to answer questions the way a human assistant might, except this one has years of receipts on my life.\n\nThis is something I've wanted since AI-powered chatbots blew up in late 2022. Back then, I'd pour my soul into ChatGPT and get a smart answer. Then, the bot would immediately forget I existed, like a genius goldfish. Over the last few years, OpenAI and Anthropic have enabled their chatbots to connect to services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. But Google has home field advantage: it already has the broadest view of what you've actually done, searched, watched, and saved.\n\nGemini's ability to connect the dots is scary-good, well beyond what ChatGPT or Claude can do. When I asked it for sightseeing ideas for my parents, who have already visited the Bay Area a few times, it suggested museums and gardens, correctly inferring they've already done hikes and trips to redwood forests.\n\nWhen I asked Gemini how it knew, it told me it deduced this based on \"breadcrumbs\" left across my Google account: Family emails, photos of Muir Woods, a parking reservation in Gmail, and a Google search for \"easy hikes for seniors.\"\n\nThis is so powerful that Google is already trying to preempt the freak-out. VP Josh Woodward said Google takes \"steps to filter or obfuscate personal data\" from the conversations we have with Gemini.\n\n\"We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to understand that when you ask for one, we can locate it,\" he wrote recently.\n\nSo, I asked it for my license plate number and it was able to locate it, based on photos of my car in Google Photos.\n\nI also asked Gemini when my car insurance was up for renewal and it correctly told me, based on emails from AAA in my Gmail inbox.\n\nWhen I asked it to help me plan an upcoming trip, it accounted for the fact that we're traveling with an infant — because it already knows we have a new baby. Of course it does.\n\nThis is the future every AI company keeps promising. Last year, Meta said its new north star wasn't \"the metaverse\" — that alternate VR universe the company is literally named after — but \"personal superintelligence,\" an AI that \"knows us deeply, understands our goals, and can help us achieve them.\"\n\nOne path to that vision: AI-powered glasses that can see and hear what you see and hear, turning everyday life into the raw material for an always-on assistant. To get there, Meta has poured billions of dollars into a hiring spree and into the data centers needed to run it all.\n\nBut Meta doesn't have a digital record of my life like Google does. I barely post on Facebook. I mostly swipe through Instagram Reels. WhatsApp is encrypted. And after Meta killed Supernatural, my favorite VR workout app, I have very little reason to use its Quest headset anymore.\n\nMeta talks about \"personal superintelligence\" as a future goal. As far as I'm concerned, Google just shipped it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

The tech giant received wide praise across the industry for the capabilities of its Gemini 3 AI model, which some observers said had surpassed ChatGPT.\n\nWhile declining to detail what he described as OpenAI's missteps, Tworek said that the pioneering AI company should never have lost the lead it established with the release of ChatGPT in 2022.\n\n\"If you are a company that is ahead and has all the advantages that OpenAI has you should always stay ahead,\" he said.\n\nOverall, Tworek said, \"Google did a lot of things right.\"\n\n\"Very clearly, Google started treating seriously at that moment, training large language models and, like, through OpenAI fumbling its lead, they are very, very close now in capability and in terms of models trained,\" he said, adding that the whole industry began to up its investment in AI when OpenAI showed ChatGPT could generate revenue.\n\nAs for OpenAI, Tworek said that the sheer toll of the AI race has led the non-profit-research lab-turned-public-benefit-corporation to place less of an emphasis on risky research that may not yield results. A spokesperson for OpenAI did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\n\"There are multiple aspects of certain things that are just hard to do in a company that has to compete in an extremely, extremely brutal and demanding race for having the best AI model in the world right now,\" he said. \"One dynamic is there is naturally how much willingness of risks companies are willing to take from the perspective of trying to not fall behind.\"\n\nTworek said \"all major AI companies\" are facing pressure to show user growth and pay for GPUs while simultaneously competing to be the best available model.\n\n\"That does affect somehow your appetite for risk that you are willing to take,\" he said.\n\nDo you work at OpenAI or Google?

    "title": "10 Google Search Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "These tips can help you get better search results.",
    "fullText": "It's not just you. Google Search has become significantly worse in recent years. In the past, you only had to watch out for low-quality content filled with SEO-bait keywords. Today, you have to be wary of AI-generated garbage, misinformation, and a generally worse UI. Still, it's not impossible to find good search results on Google. I've found a number of tricks that have helped me reduce the number of low-quality entries Google returns for my searches. Here are 10 such tips everyone should know about before their next search:\n\nI'm still annoyed by Google's decision to slap AI right at the top of search results, and I make it a point to get rid of it every time I use a new browser or a new device. Doing this is much harder if you're using the Google Search app, so stick to web browsers if you want to rid yourself of AI results. To that end, there are actually a few easy ways to remove AI from Google's results. The quickest is to add -ai to your search queries and Google will remove AI results. Alternatively, you can try using the Hide Gemini browser extension.\n\nGoogle's best days were when it showed a simple page with 10 blue links the moment you searched for anything. If you want to return to that simplicity, you can use the Web search filter in Google. Once you search for something on Google, click the More button below the search bar up top, and select Web. This will remove all the clutter from Google Search and return 10 webpages at a time. If you use Chrome, you can simply type \"web\" in the address bar to start a Web search.\n\nI've also written about a browser extension called Lucky, which does the same thing in Safari for iPhone. Lucky is available at a one-time fee of $3, and, in my opinion, it's well worth the price.\n\nIf you know the domain you want to visit, you can limit your search to that domain alone. For example, you could restrict results to .gov if you only want to look at official US government sites, or .fr if you only wish to search websites registered in France. Just add site:.gov (or any other domain of your choice) to your search queries, and you'll find better results that way. It's also useful if you want to restrict searches to .ac.uk or .edu sites, which are more education-focused.\n\nIf you've found a trusted source that you like, such as Lifehacker, you can use Google to restrict your results only to that website. You can add site:lifehacker.com to your queries on Google, and it'll only show you results from this website. Just replace the name of the site with whichever one you like. This method is often better than using that site's internal search tools, too.\n\nWhen you're looking for specific information, you may be better off searching for a particular file format. For instance, if you're looking for scientific articles, you may have a better chance of finding a pdf file than a web result. In these cases, you can use the filetype:pdf filter to locate pdf files, and you can replace the file type to locate results in a different file format.\n\nIf you're finding significantly worse results using Google search, you can try to refine the results by using Google's built-in filters. Just below the search bar, you'll see a few tabs such as All, News, More, Tools, etc. Click through each of these to eliminate certain types of results. Specifically, the Tools tab lets you refine results by date, and even allows you to remove results for related search terms and focus only on exact matches.\n\nSometimes, basic Google search tools just aren't good enough to find what you need. This is particularly true when your search terms include words that are popular for other reasons. For instance, you're searching \"president,\" but not the president of your country. This is where advanced search could help you remove unwanted results. You can go to the Google Advanced Search page and use all the filters there to find what you need. Each filter has a helpful description right next to it, which makes it easy to figure out what you're doing.\n\nGoogle also allows you to upload files and images to find results. Open Google search and click the + button in the search bar to upload a file or an image. You can attach a query to the image, and Google will help answer that question, or you can even look for images similar to the one you've uploaded. This can be useful if you want to detect fake profiles online, as scammers often steal profile photos from others to create a fake identity.\n\nIf you can't always be bothered with using various manual methods to hide all the junk from your Google Search results, consider using a content blocker to do so. My favorite has long been uBlock Origin, which is available on desktop and on mobile. It'll remove all sponsored results, unwanted product listings, and most types of junk from your Google results.\n\nIf you really like and trust certain websites, you should add those as preferred sources on Google. This will ensure that results from those sites are highlighted among search results and the Top Stories section in your search results. Google rolled this feature out in 2025, and it's the most effective way to find information from higher quality websites. If you'd like, you can click this link to add Lifehacker as a preferred source.",

    "fullText": "Students have long studied for the SATs with endless flashcards and prep books that doubled as doorstops. There's also personal tutors and prep classes for those who can afford it.\n\nGoogle debuted free, on-demand practice tests for the SAT through Google Gemini on Wednesday. The content of these tests is vetted by the Princeton Review — one of the publishers of those study tombs — while feedback is given by Google's AI.\n\nWhile the practice tests are only available for the SAT, Google teased that more exams were coming in the future.\n\n\"For anything you don't understand, you can ask Gemini to explain the correct answer,\" wrote Google DeepMind's Carol Walport. \"By helping you identify specific knowledge gaps, Gemini empowers you to turn those insights into action.\"\n\nWe’re launching full-length, on demand practice exams for standardized tests in @GeminiApp, starting with the SAT, available now at no cost.\n\nPractice SATs are grounded in rigorously vetted content in partnership with @ThePrincetonRev, and Gemini will provide immediate feedback… pic.twitter.com/GmivPuBp7B\n\nIt's another blow to the tutoring industry, a small but lucrative space coaching young adults toward academic success. College prep is especially high-earning. One SAT tutor told Business Insider last year that he charged $135 to $155 an hour; an essay tutor said he made $200,000 while only working nine months.\n\nIt's not the first time technology has eaten into the largely human tutoring industry. PDFs of practice tests have long run rampant around the internet. Tools like Quizlet and Chegg have made it easier for students to share study materials.\n\nThe threat of AI is wholly new, though, and the industry is still figuring out how to respond.\n\nIn 2023, Chegg's stock crashed 49% in a single day after the company said students were using ChatGPT to study. Two years later, the company laid off 45% of its workforce — or 388 employees — while citing the \"new realities of AI.\"\n\nSal Khan, the founder of the online tutoring program Khan Academy, said in 2023 that AI could be the \"biggest positive transformation that education has ever seen.\" Khan aims to give every student an \"artificially intelligent, but amazing, personal tutor.\"\n\nThe AI companies also know that education is a space where they can grow. Anthropic launched Claude for Education in April, which included student programs and a \"learning mode.\" Elon Musk's xAI has Grokipedia, a knowledge base similar to Wikipedia.\n\nOpenAI launched its Study Mode in July, when Business Insider declared education a \"new battlefield in the AI war.\"\n\nIn his famous 2023 letter about the future of AI, Bill Gates gave significant space to his predictions for education. Teachers would need to adapt, he wrote, but they wouldn't go away entirely.\n\n\"Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers,\" Gates wrote. \"It will enhance — but never replace — the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.\"\n\nBut for students and parents evaluating their options ahead of SAT season, Gemini's new test-prep offerings are the latest competition for human tutors.",

    "description": "Apple, Siri, and Google Gemini AI are at the forefront as Apple rebuilds its assistant, betting on AI model commoditization and flexibility.",
    "fullText": "Apple's decision to rebuild Siri around Google's Gemini AI models looks, at first glance, like an admission of failure. After years of promising breakthroughs, Apple is reportedly paying Google roughly $1 billion a year to keep its digital assistant relevant.\n\nLook closer, though, and the move represents something more radical: a giant bet that AI models will become commodities.\n\nTop tech reporter Mark Gurman wrote this week that Apple's revamped Siri, codenamed Campos, will launch later this year as a full-fledged chatbot embedded across iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The underlying intelligence will come from Google's Gemini.\n\nThe more important detail is architectural. Apple is designing Campos so that the underlying AI models can be swapped out over time, according to Gurman's report for Bloomberg.\n\n\"That means the company will have the flexibility to move away from Google-powered systems in the future if it so chooses,\" he wrote.\n\nThat design choice tells us a lot about Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRather than trying to win an AI arms race against Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta by spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure, Apple appears to be positioning itself as model-agnostic. Siri remains Apple's direct interface to more than 1 billion iPhone users. The \"brains\" underneath, however, can change.\n\nIf Apple is right, the leading AI models will converge in quality over time, becoming roughly interchangeable. At that point, differentiation shifts away from the model itself and toward distribution, integration, privacy controls, and user experience — areas where Apple already excels.\n\nApple could then choose whichever AI provider is best, cheapest, or most strategically useful every few years. So, Google's Gemini might power Siri today, but tomorrow it could be OpenAI's latest GPT offering, or Claude from Anthropic, or whatever Meta is cooking up next, or xAI's Grok, or Mistral's offerings, or even region-specific models such as DeepSeek or Alibaba's Qwen in China. Services like OpenRouter already demonstrate how models can be swapped in and out.\n\nApple is also playing a longer game. Its search deal with Google, worth an estimated $20 billion a year, shows how valuable iPhone distribution is. If AI models truly commoditize, Apple could eventually flip the Siri relationship the same way: AI model providers could end up paying Apple for access to its massive user base.\n\nThe strategy also saves Apple enormous capital expenditure. While rivals pour huge sums of money into AI data centers and chips, Apple can let others shoulder that cost. For instance, Google spent more than $60 billion in capex during the first three quarters of 2025, while Apple spent $12.7 billion in its latest fiscal year.\n\nIf this AI building boom turns about to be a bust, Apple may dodge a bullet. Of course, it might turn out that underinvesting in your own AI capabilities is a strategic blunder of epic proportions.\n\nWe'll see in the next few years. Right now, Apple just placed a huge bet that the real power in the AI era won't belong to model makers, but to whoever controls the interface.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting...",
    "fullText": "Nestled in Bloomberg’s reporting earlier on Apple’s plans to revamp Siri as a chatbot with iOS 27, was an interesting tidbit on a possible change in the company’s cloud strategy. Specifically, Mark Gurman says Apple and Google are discussing running the next-generation Siri models directly on Google’s servers, not Apple’s.\n\nWith iOS 26.4, Apple is set to launch the first new LLM Siri features, using models running in Private Cloud Compute based on an older generation of Gemini. But the Siri chatbot coming in the iOS 27 cycle will apparently be based off the newer, smarter, Gemini 3 models. Running these latest-gen models seemingly requires higher performance servers than what Apple can deliver right now through its own Private Compute cloud infrastructure …\n\nAs such, Apple user conversations with the new Siri chatbot experience would be trafficked through Google’s (much larger) cloud infrastructure for every request.\n\nThat would represent a big departure philosophically for Apple, which talked up Private Cloud Compute as a way to extend the privacy bubble of the personal data on your iPhone into Apple’s cloud. However, the Private Cloud Compute idea was designed under a prior regime. When Apple was promoting Private Cloud Compute at WWDC 2024, it had not conceived needing to license Gemini models from Google at all.\n\nAs such, it’s not unthinkable that other elements of its AI plan may be in flux. While Apple would probably like to keep as much of its processing running on its cloud, rather than a third-party, the new heads of Siri — Craig Federighi and former Vision Pro exec Mike Rockwell — seem to be choosing practicality over idealism. There is clearly pressure to ‘catch up’ and deliver modern Siri features to users as soon as possible, even if that means reneging on some parts of their prior published vision.\n\nAfter all, the company was also previously downplaying the premise of a chatbot experience altogether, but plans change and Apple is clearly responding to the proven market success of services like ChatGPT. It’s also probably safe to assume that Apple would negotiate the Google cloud server arrangement such that sensitive user data is not logged or retained by Google, sufficiently siloed from Google’s advertising and data collection units.\n\nBehind the scenes, parts of iCloud have depended on providers like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform since its inception. These third-party data storage partners enable features like iCloud Photos to operate and scale, all the while Apple holds the encryption keys. Back in 2021, it was reported that Google’s cloud hosted an enormous 8 exabytes of iCloud content.\n\nCheck out 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

    "title": "Google Just Promised No Ads in Gemini (for Now)",
    "description": "The statement comes about a week after OpenAI announced ads are coming to ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "A week after OpenAI admitted it will soon start testing ads in ChatGPT, Google has promised that it's not planning to inject ads into Gemini anytime soon.\n\nThe statement was given to journalist Alex Heath during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the company doesn't have \"any plans\" for ads in Gemini. While the statement was fairly brief, it also jibes with a similar quote Hassabis gave to Axios, where he said he was \"a little bit surprised\" that OpenAI was already introducing ads to ChatGPT.\n\nThat surprise is understandable, especially because OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2024 that he considered ads a \"last resort for us as a business model.\" But looking at the numbers, it makes sense that ChatGPT is getting ads long before Gemini is even thinking of them.\n\nWhile Google makes most of its money through showing people ads, it's also able to rely on Search and YouTube to push ads to most of those eyeballs. Meanwhile, OpenAI is pretty much just ChatGPT. As the latter moves to a for-profit model, it now has to put moneymaking first, something it's had trouble doing without relying on traditional internet moneymakers like ads. Google, meanwhile, is already profitable elsewhere, and is able to take its time and use its sheer size to keep Gemini ad-free, at least while it continues to chase market share.\n\nDoes this mean Google's AI will never get ads? Well, never say never. But it does mean that they're probably not on the horizon—even if Google plans to more aggressively monetize Gemini over the long term, it isn't facing the same kind of time crunch as Altman's company.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the presence of ads will push users away from ChatGPT, but the move comes in the wake of significant wins for Gemini and one major loss for ChatGPT. First, Google's Nano Banana image editing model went viral on social media, winning over the general public. Then, Google struck a deal with Apple to put its AI into the iPhone, and it looks like Gemini will be powering Siri for the foreseeable future.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT reportedly saw a 6% dip in users early last month, following a model update from Gemini—and that was before the introdution of ads. While ChatGPT still seems to be in the lead on total user count, there's evidence that Google is catching up.\n\nThe divide in strategy seems clear: As OpenAI seeks ways to get more money out of its existing user base, Google can focus on growing its own with new integrations into the products we already use every day. I can't say what the limits of this growth are, but I can say that I rarely go out of my way use AI, yet I've still found myself accidentally relying on Google's AI overviews every now and then. If Google can get more people like me to casually integrate AI into our regular workflows, it's possible we could soon have a new AI leader on our hands.",

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.\n\nHistorically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.\n\nSnap remains a defendant in the other two cases.\n\nBeasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.\n\n“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in a statement last year.\n\nSnap, Meta, TikTok and YouTube have been contacted for comment.",

A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has been aggressively executing on immigration enforcement; some of the tactics have led to highly publicized clashes between local community members and ICE agents.\n\nMinneapolis — the city where George Floyd was killed by a police officer — recently became a focal point of an immigration crackdown, and where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen.\n\nThe Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, an AFL-CIO affiliate, endorsed a move on Saturday encouraging local residents to skip work on January 23.\n\nThe White House has also targeted the tech industry by attaching a higher fee to the H-1B visa — a program tech companies and other industries have relied on to hire overseas talent.\n\nThe move has seen ripple effects from Big Tech, down to higher education.\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center showed a 5.9% decline in enrollment at US universities by graduate international students for the Fall 2025 semester.",
