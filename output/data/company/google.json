    "description": "Google Cloud executive Yasmeen Ahmad says she looks for candidates who show creative problem-solving in technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Google executive Yasmeen Ahmad is looking for something specific when hiring engineers — and it's not just technical know-how.\n\nAhmad told Business Insider that the typical software engineering interview used to focus on detailed coding tests and test suites. Now, as she hires for a forward-deployed engineering team, which will work with customers, she said she's prioritizing people with fresh ideas.\n\nThe strongest candidates are \"able to think outside the box,\" Ahmad, director of Google Cloud's data cloud, said. \"They're able to think outside the frame of how we would have normally described a problem.\"\n\nThe executive added that candidates who take a traditional approach to engineering aren't performing as well in her team's interviews. The ideal candidate nowadays, she said, can demonstrate creative problem-solving by using AI to reimagine traditional processes. She said she evaluates that type of thinking in two ways:\n\nAhmad said she looks for candidates who are constantly \"tinkering\" with new tools. That gives her an immediate signal that they're creative thinkers.\n\n\"When you're interviewing them, they're naturally immediately talking about, 'oh, last week I had tried AI in this context, and this is how it made me better at doing my job in this way,'\" Ahmad said.\n\nThese candidates aren't trying new tools because their boss told them to or because it's the new cool thing to try, she said.\n\n\"They're the early adopters,\" Ahmad said.\n\nTech executives have told Business Insider that side projects are becoming increasingly common for candidates to demonstrate their aptitude in interviews. However, Ahmad said candidates don't need to have a GitHub repository of projects they've worked on in their spare time.\n\n\"It doesn't have to be pet side projects, because people are busy,\" Ahmad said, adding that workers can experiment on the job by trying out new ways to speed up their work.\n\nAI is being used more often throughout the interview process — in some cases, illicitly by job seekers, and in others, as a way for employers to test candidates' AI capabilities. As these tools reshape hiring, Ahmad said scenario-based testing has become central component to the interview process, giving hiring managers a better way to assess creativity.\n\nAhmad said she'll ask candidates how they would approach a scenario involving AI tools in an industry where they have no domain knowledge.\n\nFor example, if the example related to healthcare, a traditional candidate might say that they would take all the patients' unstructured PDFs, feed them into a single LLM prompt, and ask it to generate a summary for the doctor. That would be a \"massive liability,\" Ahmad said, because in that scenario the candidate assumes AI can inherently understand the timeline of events or clinical context of an image by looking at it.\n\nAhmad said she's looking for a candidate who can \"find solutions in a way that breaks the chains of how that workflow process has traditionally gone.\" So someone might suggest building the semantic context for the imaging data before the model sees it. Next, they would build a specific framework to ensure the agent is operating in the right time frame of data. Then, they would recommend designing a multi-step process that includes a continuous evaluation loop.\n\n\"We aren't just hiring people to write prompts,\" Ahmad said. \"We are hiring people who can foresee how a model might silently fail in a high-stakes environment, and who know how to build the automated evaluation loops to catch it before it does.\"\n\nShe said asking these sorts of questions to vet creativity is especially useful as AI transforms the software engineering industry by automating core parts of the job.\n\n\"We're seeing the human role is evolving to more of an orchestrated role,\" Ahmad said. \"So rather than having to write all of the detailed code, it's 'how do I actually express my intent to a multi-agent system now and have that multi-agent system execute on that intent?'\"",

    "description": "Valerie Valcourt worked in Big Tech for years, making six figures at Google. She left the tech industry behind to attend pastry school in France.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Valerie Valcourt, 36, who previously worked at Amazon and Google before she became a pastry chef. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I took a home economics class where we baked a lot. It was one of my favorite classes. One time, my teacher said, \"Val, you're running this for the day,\" and I was in charge of everything. That's when I knew I'd love to go to pastry school.\n\nI graduated from high school in 2007, and my parents said, \"You're not going to pastry school. You don't need to be in the kitchen.\"\n\nI worked at Big Tech companies for about five years, but as time passed, I realized I wasn't happy. That dream of wanting to go to pastry school had never disappeared.\n\nI was living in Seattle and making over $100,000 with equity and bonuses as an administrative business partner at Google. I lucked out finding good apartments in cool neighborhoods, and financially, I was OK, but I felt unfulfilled. I was in environments where it was very dog-eat-dog. I'd look around the room and think, \"What am I doing here?\"\n\nI kept asking myself why I wasn't doing something that brought me joy. I would still bake here and there, making cakes and cupcakes for friends, and found myself enjoying the process.\n\nI applied to a pastry school in Paris and got accepted, but the school's fees were high, and I realized I didn't actually have the funds.\n\nI also wasn't mentally prepared. I felt stuck in this frozen state, unable to make the moves I needed to. So I left Big Tech and moved to New York for a year. I became an executive assistant at a meditation company, and it was one of the most stressful jobs I've ever had. It really affirmed my decision to go to pastry school.\n\nI knew that if I went to school in the US, I'd probably be taking on a lot of loans, so I began looking in France again.\n\nI found an accelerated three-month program called Gastronomicon in Agde, a small beach village in the south of France. It provided pastry lessons, French lessons, a four-month internship at a Michelin-level restaurant, and housing for both the school and internship. Everything was $10,000. Any other school I looked at lacked at least one of those things and still had a higher price tag.\n\nWhen I told my parents, they were so supportive. My sister, friends, and everyone rallied around me, which was so helpful during those moments when I had doubts about starting over. I was 33 at the time. I thought, \"OK, I can do this and see where this takes me. I don't know what's going to happen after school, but I'm going to do my best.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy to assimilate right away. I had three hours of French class and three hours of pastry every Monday through Friday.\n\nMy school was scheduled so that each week was a theme, like bread, chocolate, plated desserts, or entremets. I had no idea there were so many desserts in France, so everything was completely brand-new — from the meringues to the pâte à choux.\n\nThere was also a lot of culture shock. I didn't speak much French before going to pastry school. I remember going to the grocery store, just pointing at things, panicking, and apologizing profusely. That forced me to get serious and learn as much as I could before my internship.\n\nSometimes, I struggled with the same imposter syndrome I had while working in tech. Then I found those moments of joy when I'd pull a cake out of the oven, and it came out so well. My whole world exploded in the best way possible because it gave me the gift of having to push myself so much in such a short amount of time.\n\nEven during moments of doubt, I was excited to be in the kitchen and work with people every week, learning where I could grow and what my strengths were.\n\nI found joy every day, even in the French homework. I started out not knowing much French, and then I could actually speak to people in restaurants and navigate around the country. I didn't know what a meringue was, and now I can make a lemon meringue pie.\n\nI pulled myself out of that dark place I had been in while working in Big Tech. My spirits lifted being around people who loved talking about food and nerding out on pastry. We would gather for potlucks and eat all the desserts we could find at local patisseries. It was such a unique bonding experience. I was trusting myself and letting myself be as open as I could be.\n\nI don't miss Big Tech. I'm grateful that chapter of my life has closed, and I can focus on this one. I love working with my hands and not staring at a computer screen for eight hours a day.\n\nAfter pastry school, I was going to move to Paris. Then Disney Cruise Line reached out, and I knew I couldn't say no. I've worked on the Disney Treasure and Disney Wish ships as a demi chef de partie. I'm returning to the Treasure in March.\n\nThe goal is to open up my own patisserie in the Connecticut area. I would love to share my favorite desserts, play with the different ingredients I've learned about in France, and bring new things to the table we haven't seen in the States.\n\nI want to encourage people to follow their dreams. Sometimes, when you're in your 30s or older, you're scared to start over. But the truth is, you're not stuck. Now I get to travel the world and pour energy into my passion.\n\nLife doesn't have to stop just because you get older. If anything, it's beginning to open up — if you just allow it.",

    "title": "Google Just Announced Three New Gemini Upgrades for Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10",
    "description": "Android AI is getting smarter, but you currently need a Pixel 10 or Galaxy S26 for these upgrades.",
    "fullText": "To coincide with the Samsung Galaxy S26 launch, Google announced three Gemini-related upgrades for Android, coming first to both the Galaxy S26 series and the Google Pixel 10 range. In fact, one of these new features seems like a significant step forward for AI on smartphones: the ability for Gemini to handle multi-step tasks on an Android phone. The examples Google gives are booking a ride through Uber or reordering a meal on DoorDash, where the AI takes care of everything in the background, leaving you free to worry about, well, whether it's going to work.\n\n\"When you're working on a repetitive daily task, it's easy to daydream about handing it off to someone else,\" explains Google in the announcement blog post. \"Now, we're showing an early preview of what's possible.\" Understandably, this has a \"beta\" label as well as an \"early preview\" label attached, and it's initially only going to be available on Galaxy S26 phones and Pixel 10 phones (the Pixel 10a misses out). It'll also be limited to the U.S. and South Korea to begin with.\n\nAs per Google, the process will be tightly controlled: Automations begin with your voice command and end as soon as the task is finished. Live notifications will keep you updated throughout, and you can jump in and take manual control at any time. What's more, the app is run in a \"secure, virtual window\" on your phone, with restricted app access.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to see how well this works. If it works well, this feels like a notable moment in getting AI to actually do mobile tasks for us. It's not clear if Google needs third-party app permission for this, but for now the feature will be available \"for select apps\" in the food, grocery, and rideshare categories.\n\nNext, Google is upgrading Circle to Search on Android, the feature that lets you circle anything on screen and run a search from it. Circle to Search can do everything from find you a lamp online to warn you about a phishing scam.\n\nNow, Circle to Search will be able to search multiple elements on screen at once. It might be different pieces of furniture in a room, or different items of clothing in an outfit. You don't actually make the selections yourself: You just circle the relevant area (or the entire screen), and Gemini picks out the various constituent parts.\n\n\"We know that sometimes you aren't just looking for a single thing on your screen—you're looking for the whole thing,\" says Google. \"Whether you're curating a mood board, building an entire outfit or just satisfying your multi-layered curiosity...Circle to Search is getting a whole lot more helpful.\"\n\nGoogle is also embedding the ability to virtually try on clothes from your phone in the Circle to Search flow. It's similar to the Gemini multi-step process above, with the AI taking on several sequential tasks to (in theory) be even more useful—technically, Google calls it a query fan-out technique. Again, this will be exclusive to Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 phones, with no word yet on this potentially expanding to other handsets.\n\nFinally, the last upgrade is more of a wider roll out than a new feature. The Scam Detection AI that Android uses to detect if you're being scammed in calls in real time is coming to the Galaxy S26 series for users in the U.S. It's already offered on multiple Pixel models in the U.S., the UK, Australia, Canada, India, and Ireland. The same technology is also currently available in Google Messages to catch text-based scams, and Google says it's \"enhancing\" how this works to recognize more varied scams, starting with Galaxy S26 and Pixel 10 devices. The new and improved tech will use on-device models to better spot techniques used by scammers.",

    "description": "Seven former Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft workers share why they left their jobs in a tough market without another role lined up.",
    "fullText": "Last year, Joslyn Orgill stood at a crossroads. She could keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue something that felt more fulfilling.\n\nOrgill and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice. Still, the reasons to leave began to build. She was concerned about job security in tech, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science — and potentially a career in academia.\n\nLast August, Orgill quit her Google job and started a Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" she said.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers like Orgill, many of them from Big Tech companies, who chose to quit their jobs without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large company, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely — joining a smaller business, launching their own venture, pursuing a career pivot, or focusing on personal priorities like parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown across tech and other sectors that's left some clinging to their jobs with few appealing alternatives.\n\nThose who have called it quits told me they did so for a mix of reasons: concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, or a desire for more meaningful work. In short, they wanted greater long-term agency over their careers.\n\nLast year, David Chong began thinking about quitting his job at Microsoft. Since joining the company in 2022, he said he had struggled to earn a promotion from his senior software engineer role. To move up the corporate ladder, he said it felt like he needed to develop a \"getting promoted\" skill — one that required a lot of internal self-promotion.\n\nChong also said he had become the most senior engineer on his team, which meant there were fewer experienced colleagues to learn from, limiting his growth.\n\n\"I was growing frustrated with the slow promotion timeline,\" said Chong, who is 37 and lives in Toronto.\n\nAt the same time, Chong was increasingly interested in building an AI sales agent startup, a company developing an AI phone agent that screens inbound leads, filters out nonbuyers, and routes qualified prospects to sales representatives.\n\nHe said this move would be easier because he'd built up savings and had no dependents. In September, he resigned from Microsoft to pursue his venture full-time.\n\n\"My plan is to give myself about three years,\" he said. \"If all else fails, I'll go back into the job market.\"\n\nFrustrations with changing workplace expectations were also among the reasons Nicole Landis Ferragonio and Joe Luchs decided to call it quits. While working together at Amazon, they began talking seriously about building a startup of their own — and both resigned last year to focus on their venture, Datalinx AI.\n\nFerragonio said one of the reasons she decided to leave was Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate.\n\n\"It raised some questions about how much agency you really have in Big Tech and what would be possible on our own,\" she said.\n\nLuchs said the potential of AI technologies made it seem like there was an immense opportunity to build something new.\n\n\"The FOMO of not being able to get in on this AI opportunity was another driver to make me want to move fast here,\" he said.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decision to quit and pursue an AI-related startup — and take advantage of the rapid advances in the technology — was a common theme among the quitters I spoke with. However, for some, the decision to resign was more personal than professional.\n\nIn October 2024, Kruthika Jayatheertha took six months of maternity leave from her role as a senior user experience researcher at Microsoft. During that time, she decided to take a more extended career break — and resigned.\n\nJayatheertha said being around her daughter full-time has allowed her to witness many of her \"firsts\" — crawling, standing, wobbly walks — without hearing about them secondhand. She said that having a present mother during a child's early years is crucial to their development.\n\n\"It was clear to me that stepping away from work was the right choice,\" said Jayatheertha, who lives in India. She added that her husband's income made her break possible and that she plans to return to work around the time her daughter turns 18 months in April.\n\nPersonal circumstances also significantly influenced Alyson Isaacs' career decision. After working at a startup that \"completely drained\" her savings to $200, she joined Meta as a product manager in 2022. But her entrepreneurial itch never left, so she began preparing financially for a return to entrepreneurship — including moving to a less expensive area, going to a basic gym, and cooking more at home.\n\nThe question was when to make the leap and leave Meta. Isaacs said the death of her father in 2024 weighed heavily on her decision.\n\n\"That really triggered this thought in my brain of, 'Is being a product manager at a Big Tech company what I want to do for the rest of my life?'\" she said. \"And the answer was resoundingly no.\"\n\nLast July, she resigned to build a startup, which she described as an \"agentic AI solution for personal wellness.\"\n\nWhether it was raising a child, avoiding a daily commute, or building an AI startup, the common constraint was time. And quitting their jobs was the only way to reclaim it.\n\nWhen Jason White began thinking about building an AI startup, he knew it would mean leaving his job at Meta. Trying to juggle the business with his role as a full-time machine-learning engineer wouldn't have made sense for several reasons. For one, he already had two demanding roles as a Meta employee and a parent.\n\nHis other concern was legal, since he would have had to disclose any outside business to Meta, and there could've been non-compete issues.\n\nUltimately, he said, it was his passion for the venture — along with the financial cushion he built over the years — that pushed him to make the leap.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I want to take the swing,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "What is Google RankBrain and how does it affect your brand's visibility? We break down how Google's machine learning algorithm works, its connection to AI search, and the specific steps you can take to optimize — from traditional SEO to visibility in ChatGPT and Perplexity\n\nImagine typing something like \"gray console made by Sony\" into Google. You never wrote the word \"PlayStation.\" But Google knows that's exactly what you're looking for. Ten years ago, the search engine would have been stumped. Today, it figures out queries like this in milliseconds. The technology behind this magic has a name - Google RankBrain.\n\nAnd if you think RankBrain is a relic from the SEO history archives, here's some news: this algorithm is not only alive and well, it has become the foundation for everything Google does with artificial intelligence in search today.\n\nLet's break down how it works, why it matters more than ever, and what all of this means for your brand's visibility - in traditional search and in the new AI-powered engines.\n\nGoogle officially confirmed RankBrain's existence on October 26, 2015. It's a machine learning system built into Google's core algorithm (Hummingbird) that helps process search results and understand what users are actually looking for.\n\nAt launch, RankBrain handled roughly 15% of all search queries — specifically, the ones Google had never seen before. That might not sound like much. But when Google processes billions of queries a day, 15% translates to hundreds of millions of searches the engine previously couldn't handle properly.\n\nToday, RankBrain is involved in virtually every query. Google called it the third most important ranking factor — after content and links. And Google's own experiments showed that RankBrain picks the best result more accurately than human search engineers: 80% accuracy for RankBrain versus 70% for humans.\n\nRankBrain isn't a standalone algorithm that replaces everything else. It's a component inside Hummingbird, like a part within a car engine. And it has two main functions.\n\nBefore RankBrain, Google looked at individual words in a query and tried to find pages with exact matches. RankBrain changed the approach: it converts words into mathematical vectors (numerical representations) and searches for connections between concepts.\n\nA simple example: if someone searches \"what to wear in the rain to a business meeting,\" RankBrain understands the query isn't just about \"rain\" or \"clothes\" — it's about a specific situation. It connects the concepts of \"business attire,\" \"rain protection,\" and \"recommendations\" — and serves relevant results, even if no single page contains that exact phrase.\n\nThis became possible through the shift from \"strings\" to \"entities.\" Google stopped seeing text as a collection of characters and started recognizing real-world objects: people, companies, products, places.\n\nHere's what makes RankBrain truly smart: it watches how people interact with search results. Did the user click a result and stay on the page? Good sign. Did they bounce back after 5 seconds and click another result? That means the first page didn't answer their question.\n\nRankBrain uses these signals to continuously fine-tune rankings. It can dynamically adjust the weight of different factors — backlinks, content freshness, text length, domain authority — depending on the specific query. If users show that a new order of results works better, it stays. If not, the system rolls back the changes.\n\nIn essence, RankBrain is a perpetual A/B test at the scale of billions of queries.\n\nSome SEO professionals consider RankBrain outdated — after all, BERT, MUM, and Gemini came along, and RankBrain was supposedly left behind. This is a misconception.\n\nRankBrain hasn't gone anywhere. It evolved into what experts call the \"reasoning layer\" — the connective tissue between all of Google's AI systems. BERT handles deep natural language understanding. MUM processes multilingual and multimodal queries. Gemini powers generative answers. And RankBrain orchestrates all of it, deciding how much weight to give each signal for a specific query.\n\nThink of it as a conductor of an orchestra: each instrument (BERT, MUM, Gemini) plays its part, but RankBrain decides when and how loud.\n\nNow for the really interesting part. Understanding RankBrain isn't just an academic exercise. It's a direct path to understanding how AI search works as a whole.\n\nRankBrain was the first time machine learning was embedded into Google's core search algorithm. Everything that followed — BERT, AI Overviews, AI Mode — grew from the same logic: understand intent, not keywords.\n\nAnd here's the problem for brands: that same logic now operates in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI platforms. Except the rules there are even stricter.\n\nIn traditional Google, you get a list of 10 links — even if you're in 7th place, you're at least visible. In AI search, there's one answer. If the AI engine doesn't consider your brand authoritative, relevant, and trustworthy enough — you simply don't exist to the user.\n\nAccording to expert estimates, traditional search will lose up to 50% of its share by 2028. AI answers already appear in 57% of Google results. ChatGPT serves 400 million users weekly.\n\nThe good news: the principles that work for RankBrain also work for the new AI engines. Here's what you should be doing right now.\n\nRankBrain analyzes user intent. Stop thinking in terms of \"which keywords to insert\" and start thinking: \"what problem is this person trying to solve?\" Group queries into intent clusters: informational, transactional, navigational.\n\nAI systems (RankBrain included) prioritize content that explores topics in depth. Not 300-word posts written for SEO, but comprehensive guides that fully address the user's question.\n\nSchema markup helps both Google and AI engines understand what your content is about. FAQ schema, organization markup, product and author markup — all of this increases your chances of being cited in AI responses.\n\nRankBrain factors in behavioral signals. Page load speed, mobile usability, Core Web Vitals — all of these affect how users interact with your site, and therefore your rankings.\n\nAI systems aggregate signals from multiple sources: press mentions, reviews, social media, forums. Brands with a strong presence across multiple channels receive more mentions in AI responses. Estimates suggest roughly 250 quality publications are needed to meaningfully influence how an LLM perceives a brand.\n\nFresh content gets priority in both RankBrain and AI engines. If your last blog post is two years old, AI systems will more likely cite a competitor's more up-to-date source.\n\nYou can't improve what you don't measure. Traditional SEO tools don't show how your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini responses. You need specialized solutions for that — and this is exactly the problem RepuAI solves, tracking mentions, sentiment, and visibility of your brand across AI search engines.\n\nRankBrain ushered in an era where machine learning became an integral part of search. But that era isn't standing still. Today, a new discipline is gaining momentum — Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), optimization for generative search engines.\n\nThe logic of GEO is simple: if you used to optimize for an algorithm that ranks links, now you need to optimize for an algorithm that generates answers. And that's an entirely different game.\n\nIn the world of GEO, your brand needs to be:\n\nAnd here the circle closes: the principles RankBrain established — understanding intent, focusing on the user, continuous learning — have become the foundation for all modern AI search systems.\n\nRankBrain was the first — but far from the last — step Google took toward AI-driven search. Understanding its principles gives you a strategic advantage: you see not individual algorithm updates, but the overall direction the industry is heading.\n\nThat direction points one way: from keywords to meaning, from links to authority, from SERP positions to mentions in AI responses.\n\nBrands that understand this now will find themselves in a winning position. The rest will be playing catch-up.\n\nWant to find out how your brand looks through the eyes of AI right now?

    "fullText": "\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Instagram user Danny Price captioned the post revealing the offensive alert.\n\nGoogle is apologizing after publishing a news alert about Sunday's BAFTA Awards racial slur incident, with the N-word written out.\n\nA screenshot of the notification was shared online by Instagram user Danny Price, who shared several photos to his page. The alert linked out to an article by The Hollywood Reporter, which had the headline: \"How the Tourette's Fallout Unfolded at the BAFTA Film Awards.\" The notification then invited readers to \"see more on [the N-word].\"\n\nAlongside the several slides showing the Google alert, Price wrote that the occurrence was \"absolutely f---ed.\"\n\n\"What an interesting Black History month this has turned out to be,\" Price added in the caption of his post.\n\nA Google spokesperson told Entertainment Weekly: \"We're deeply sorry for this mistake. We've removed the offensive notification and are working to prevent this from happening again.\"\n\nThe tech giant told EW that the \"system error did not involve AI\" and was a case of safety filters not catching an error, adding, \"This was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We're working on improved guardrails for our push notification systems, which are designed to accurately characterize content from across the web.\"\n\nThe tech company shared that its systems recognized \"a euphemism for an offensive term\" on several web pages, and \"accidentally\" used the offensive term in the notification text. \"We caught the mistake quickly, and immediately removed it from people's devices,\" the company added. \"Only a very small subset of Google app users who get push notifications received it. This system error did not involve AI. Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nThe upset follows a bevy of reactions in the aftermath of Tourette syndrome activist John Davidson — who attended the BAFTAs in honor of I Swear, a film about his experience living with Tourette's — shouting the N-word when Sinners stars Michael B. Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented the Best Visual Effects award to Avatar: Fire and Ash. Afterwards, the show continued on, and host Alan Cumming addressed the incident with a brief statement.\n\nSinners' production designer and nominee Hannah Beachler alleged on X that she had also had a racial slur directed at her, and criticized what she called a \"throw away\" apology from the BAFTAs.\n\nBeachler also alleged that she heard Davidson use the word for a \"third time\" directed \"at a Black woman\" at the event.\n\nMany have called out the BBC for its handling of the situation, considering the broadcast aired this moment unaltered on BBC One with a two-hour delay. BBC typically airs the ceremony with alterations and indeed made edits, but this moment went untouched.\n\nMultiple outlets reported that Warner Bros. raised immediate concerns after the incident on Sunday and requested that the incident be removed from the BBC broadcast within minutes. A source told Deadline that the studio received assurances that its concerns would be passed to the BBC and producer Penny Lane TV during the recording of the ceremony.\n\nLindo even claimed that nobody from the British Academy of Film and Television approached him or Jordan to offer an apology or acknowledge the incident directly after. While speaking to Vanity Fair at a Warner Brothers' after-party, Lindo said that he and Jordan \"did what we had to do\" when they were on stage, but added that he wishes \"someone from BAFTA spoke to us afterwards.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, BBC removed the show from its streaming platform, iPlayer, and announced plans to re-edit and cut this moment.\n\nThe British Academy of Film and Television also took \"full responsibility\" for the incident in a statement shared with EW, which read, \"We take the duty of care to all our guests very seriously and start from a position of inclusion. \"\n\nThe British Academy went on to \"apologize unreservedly\" to Jordan and Lindo, thanking them for \"their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"\n\nIt concluded, \"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all. We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nDavidson addressed the incident on Monday, sharing a statement that reiterated that his verbal tics and uncontrollable swearing, which are symptoms of Tourette's, are involuntary. He stated that he is and always has been \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette’s community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so.\"\n\nDavidson additionally noted that he \"chose to leave the auditorium early\" of his own volition in acknowledgement of \"the distress my tics were causing.\"\n\nEW has reached out to representatives for Davidson, Cumming, Jordan, and Lindo for comment.",

Jordan and Delroy Lindo — both of whom are Black — were on stage to present an award.\n\nDeadline.com initially reported that AI was to blame for the racial slur appearing in the push alert. Google said that was not the case, and Deadline has since clarified its report.\n\nGoogle said it caught the mistake quickly and only a \"small subset of users\" received the alert with the unedited racial slur. The search giant said that its push alert systems recognized a euphemism for the slur used in stories and incorrectly inserted the full word.\n\n\"This system error did not involve AI,\" Google said. \"Our safety filters did not properly trigger, which is what caused this.\"\n\nTourette syndrome advocate John Davidson, whose life story served as the inspiration for the BAFTA-nominated film \"I Swear,\" later said in a statement that he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning.\"\n\nAccording to the Tourette Association of America, roughly 10% of the millions of people living with Tourette and tic disorders experience coprolalia, which is \"the involuntary vocalization of obscene or socially inappropriate words or phrases.\"\n\n\"Importantly, these vocal tics are not reflective of the beliefs or values of the person experiencing them,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nThe BBC and the BAFTAs have faced intense criticism for broadcasting the moment, even though the award ceremony was subject to a two-hour tape delay. On Monday, both the BBC and BAFTAs offered separate public apologies for the moment.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for putting our guests in a very difficult situation and we apologize to all,\" the BAFTAs said in a statement. \"We will learn from this, and keep inclusion at the core of all we do, maintaining our belief in film and storytelling as a critical conduit for compassion and empathy.\"\n\nKate Phillips, the BBC's chief content officer, said in a note to staff that another racial slur was edited out of the broadcast.\n\n\"We take full responsibility for what happened,\" Phillips wrote on Tuesday in the note, which was provided to Business Insider. \"When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down. As I'm sure you're aware we put out a statement yesterday morning apologising that the remark was not edited out prior to broadcast.\"\n\nDuring the award ceremony, host Alan Cumming made multiple statements about the language the audience might be hearing. Variety reported that \"shut the fuck up\" among other phrases could also be heard during the show.\n\n\"You may have noticed some strong language in the background,\" Cumming told the audience. \"This can be part of how Tourette's syndrome shows up for some people as the film explores that experience.\"",

    "description": "Don't trust that strange Google Forms link.",
    "fullText": "If you receive a text from a random number offering you a job, it's almost certainly a scam, and you likely know to ignore and delete the message and move on with your life. But a message from a recruiter with a link to an employment application may give you pause—and fraudsters are hoping that you'll believe it just enough to hand over your personal information. Malwarebytes recently identified a phishing scam that uses fake Google Forms posing as job applications to harvest user account credentials.\n\nThis specific campaign involves a fake Google Forms site that impersonates the real thing. Links sent to scam targets—likely via email or LinkedIn—direct to forms.google.ss-o[.]com, which looks like a subdomain of the legitimate forms.google.com. (It isn't.) The \"ss-o\" may be a trust signal for \"single sign-on\" and fail to raise red flags for many users. Each target receives a personalized URL, which leads to a (fake) Google Form inviting the user to apply for a job.\n\nAs Malwarebytes found, the fake page uses the standard Google Forms colors, header, and disclaimers. The form itself is greyed out behind a pop-up prompting users to \"sign in to continue.\" Again, this doesn't look particularly suspicious for a typical Google flow. But the sign-in button redirects to another domain that has been used in multiple phishing attacks to harvest credentials.\n\nFraudsters have long used Google apps to perpetuate phishing schemes. A 2025 campaign targeting students, faculty, and staff at U.S. colleges and universities used Google Forms that mimicked legitimate school communications to collect login credentials entered directly into the form itself. (Google warns you to never, ever do this.) And numerous attacks on Gmail users have leveraged shared Google Docs to direct victims to a fake sign-in page.\n\nAs always, your first red flag for a scam is a link sent via an unsolicited job offer—even if that link goes to a seemingly legitimate site. Scammers have all kinds of tricks for spoofing URLs and using recognizable domains to gain your trust. Always hover over hyperlinks to see the actual destination before clicking, and look carefully for additions or misspellings in the URL.\n\nPlus, you should probably be wary of any job application submitted via Google Forms. Do your due diligence in speaking with an actual human, and do not send sensitive personal information through Google Forms.\n\nThis is also a good reason to use a password manager, which won't allow you to fill login credentials on a fake site. If your password manager gives you a warning or prevents you from using autofill, don't override it.",

    "description": "Google has tweaked the way Android Auto and Do Not Disturb work together.",
    "fullText": "If you're an Android Auto user, you may already know that setting up phone notifications while you're driving isn't as straightforward as it could be—though Google has recently made a settings tweak that should simplify things. On the one hand, you don't want to miss important messages or calls, but on the other you definitely don't want to put yourself and other road users at risk by getting distracted while driving. A careful balance is needed, and it's important to know what options are available on your phone.\n\nIf you're a Pixel user, Do Not Disturb is handled by Modes, which you can find by tapping Modes in Settings. Pick Driving, and if you enable the While driving toggle switch, this mode is automatically enabled when you're in your car.\n\nTap the While driving text (not the toggle switch), and you can tell Android how it should determine whether or not you're driving. This is the setting that Google recently tweaked: You can now choose Use Bluetooth (so the mode is enabled when a car dashboard is detected), or Use motion and Bluetooth (which also takes readings from your phone's accelerometer into consideration). Previously, you had to rely solely on motion, which led to problems with automatic activation for both drivers and passengers—the addition of Bluetooth should mean a more reliable experience.\n\nIt's slightly different on Samsung Galaxy phones: You need to tap Modes and Routines from Settings, then you can access the Driving mode. Here, you can specifically set a connection to an Android Auto dashboard as the trigger for enabling the mode, rather than just any Bluetooth device—something Google should really add to standard Android.\n\nOn both Pixel and Galaxy phones, you can tweak the driving mode to allow notifications from certain apps or from certain people, but again be wary of making your vehicle too distracting with pop-ups and pings.\n\nAs well as setting which apps and contacts can trigger phone notifications while you're driving, you can customize these modes further. From the Driving mode screen on a Pixel, tap Display settings to control whether or not the phone lights up when you get a notification. You can also dim the wallpaper, and switch to a grayscale look.\n\nWhen you're editing your Driving mode on a Galaxy phone, you'll see you can tap either Lock screen or Home screen to change the wallpaper and color palette specifically for this mode. Again, the idea is that your phone is a little less distracting visually.\n\nThere are more notification options on the main Android Auto settings page: From Android Settings, tap Connected devices > Connection preferences > Android Auto (Pixel) or Connected devices > Android Auto (Galaxy).\n\nUnder the Messaging header, you can turn off alerts for group conversations, or for messaging apps entirely. There's also a toggle switch here for showing or hiding the first line of the incoming message—you probably want to disable this if you want to spend more time with your eyes on the road.\n\nFinally, there's the option for having your incoming messages read out loud to you, which is another way you can reduce the temptation to stare at your vehicle's dashboard for an extended period of time, or to pick up and unlock your phone.\n\nIt's worth reviewing all the other Android Auto settings here as well, to make sure your driving experience is set up exactly the way you want: You can reduce the number of apps available in Android Auto, for example, and enable taskbar widgets for easier app control, which can also make a difference to how distracted you are on the road.\n\nYou should end up with an Android Auto notification system that's not going to overwhelm you with alerts while you're driving, but which also won't hide important messages from you by automatically enabling notification filters without you being aware.",

    "fullText": "In the search for Nancy Guthrie, authorities have relied not only on traditional investigative work but also on data trails tied to two of the world's largest companies.\n\nGoogle and Walmart have both emerged as significant players in the high-profile investigation, assisting local Arizona law enforcement and the FBI as they work to locate the 84-year-old mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie.\n\nAuthorities believe that Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her ranch-style home in the Catalina Foothills, just outside Tucson, AZ, nearly three weeks ago.\n\nA major break in the case came more than a week into the elderly woman's mysterious disappearance, thanks, in part, to the help of Google.\n\nInitially, authorities said they were unable to retrieve any footage from Nancy Guthrie's Google-owned Nest doorbell camera because she did not have a subscription to store her video feed.\n\nThat changed when investigators, working with \"private sector partners,\" managed to cover some doorbell footage from \"residual data located in backend systems,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a previous statement on X.\n\nThe footage, released widely to the public by the FBI on February 10, revealed a masked and armed man outside Nancy Guthrie's home appearing to tamper with the doorbell camera on February 1, the day she vanished.\n\nIt took Google engineers several days to recover the footage, CNN has reported, citing a person familiar with the investigation. Google did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe tech giant is attempting to obtain additional video from Nancy Guthrie's other home cameras, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told NewsNation in a report published on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've asked Google, 'Hey guys, can you do this?' and they said the very same thing, 'Sheriff, we don't think we can get anything, but we'll try,\" Nanos said, adding that investigators remain \"hopeful.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities believe the backpack the suspect wore in the doorbell camera footage was a 25-liter \"Ozark Trail Hiker\" backpack sold exclusively at Walmart.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff's Department said this week that investigators are working with Walmart management to \"identify and isolate the individual who purchased the backpack.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Nanos described the backpack as \"one of the most promising leads\" in the case.\n\nThe sheriff said investigators have been scouring surveillance footage from local Walmart stores and that the megaretailer has turned over records of all Ozark Trail Hiker backpack purchases from the last several months, the news outlet reported.\n\nA Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the matter.\n\nSo far, the only item that has been \"positively identified\" on the suspect in the doorbell camera footage is the Ozark Trail Hiker packpack, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Investigators are working to determine where the other items may have been purchased,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nNancy Guthrie's disappearance has gripped the nation. Her famous daughter, Savannah Guthrie, has issued tearful video messages, pleading for her mother's safe return.\n\nAuthorities have not publicly identified any suspects or persons of interest in the case.\n\nDNA found at Nancy Guthrie's property is being analyzed by investigators, the sheriff's department said this week.\n\nEarlier this week, Nanos, the sheriff, said the Guthrie family, including all siblings and spouses, has been cleared as possible suspects in the case.\n\n\"The family has been nothing but cooperative and gracious and are victims in this case,\" Nanos said.",

    "description": "Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that the \"whole supply chain\" for memory chips is constrained, which also impacts AI research.",
    "fullText": "The memory shortage takes no prisoners. Even Google isn't immune.\n\nAI companies are duking it out for greater and greater quantities of memory chips. The problem? The industry is heavily supply-constrained. Costs have skyrocketed, products have been tied up, and some companies — especially those in consumer electronics — are increasing prices.\n\nOn the AI front, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told CNBC that physical challenges were \"constraining a lot of deployment.\" Google sees \"so much more demand\" for Gemini and its other models than it could serve, he said.\n\n\"Also, it does constrain a little bit the research,\" Hassabis said. \"You need a lot of chips to be able to experiment on new ideas at a big enough scale that you can actually see if they're going to work.\"\n\nResearchers want chips, whether they work at Google, Meta, OpenAI, or other Big Tech companies, and memory is a key component. Mark Zuckerberg said that AI researchers demanded two things beyond money: the fewest number of people reporting to them, and the most chips possible.\n\nHassabis said that wherever there was a capacity constraint, there was a \"choke point.\"\n\n\"The whole supply chain is kind of strained,\" Hassabis said. \"We're lucky, because we have our own TPUs, so we have our own chip designs.\"\n\nGoogle has long built TPUs — Tensor Processing Units — for internal use. The company also leases them to external customers through its cloud, which has also put Nvidia on edge.\n\nBut even access to their own TPUs won't save Google from having to navigate the highly competitive memory market. \"It still, in the end, actually comes down to a few suppliers of a few key components,\" Hassabis said.\n\nThree suppliers dominate memory chip production: Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. These companies are struggling to meet demand for chips from AI hyperscalers without dropping their longtime electronics customers.\n\nIt doesn't help that AI companies mainly want a different type of memory chip than PC manufacturers do. Large language model producers want HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips.\n\nDon't expect Google's spending on AI infrastructure and chips to go down anytime soon. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company projected capital expenditures of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026.",

    "description": "Multitasking in Chrome just got a whole lot better.",
    "fullText": "While I generally consider Chrome to be a mature, feature complete browser, it's great to see that Google is still making meaningful additions to it. With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.\n\nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.\n\nSplit View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add \n\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n\nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.\n\nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"",

    "description": "Snapseed now comes with a fully fledged camera app inside it.",
    "fullText": "Google acquired the excellent photo editor Snapseed back in 2012—not long after Apple had crowned it one of its apps of the year—and despite having plenty to offer and being completely free to use, it remains one of Google's lesser-known apps. That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers \n\nOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n\nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer.\n\nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n\nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.\n\nUp in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n\nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.\n\nMost filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.\n\nIt's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.",

    "fullText": "Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams.\n\nTwo custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market.\n\nSilicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The love of watches has bred collectors' groups within some of the biggest companies.\n\nA watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500.\n\nThe style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. Similar pre-owned models typically resell for around $3,000.\n\nThe limited Apple collectors group edition features a skull-and-crossbones pirate flag motif with deep ties to Apple's history.\n\nIt's a callback to the Steve Jobs era. The late CEO once said in a meeting, \"It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy,\" and the members of the Macintosh team often referred to themselves as pirates, as a former employee described in a blog post. In a nod to those roots, the company flew a pirate flag over Apple's headquarters for its 40th anniversary.\n\nAbout 82 of these \"pirate\" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing.\n\nA Tudor watch created in collaboration with Google's watch collector group, Watches@, is also for sale on the vintage watch marketplace Wind Vintage.\n\nIt's from Tudor's Pelagos collection and features a Google-centric twist that tech fans may recognize: the Google Chrome Dino at the 6 o'clock position on the dial. The design is inspired by the Chrome Dino that pops up when your computer isn't connected to the internet. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome.\n\nThe watch, created in 2024, is listed for $14,900. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451.\n\nOther Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces.\n\nApple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nLoupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving.\n\nThey tend to sell for more than base models because of their limited quantities, Ku said, and they attract \"real fans\" of the brands they represent.\n\n\"For tech nerds like myself, the pirate flag is a symbol that has a long tradition of being used by the Apple folks,\" Ku said. \"Also, the imagery of that pirate flag is quite charming.\"",

    "description": "Exclusive: England and Wales charity to examine safeguards after Guardian exposed ‘very dangerous’ advice on Google AI...",
    "fullText": "Exclusive: England and Wales charity to examine safeguards after Guardian exposed ‘very dangerous’ advice on Google AI Overviews\n\n‘Very dangerous’: a Mind mental health expert on Google’s AI summaries\n\nMind is launching a significant inquiry into artificial intelligence and mental health after a Guardian investigation exposed how Google’s AI Overviews gave people “very dangerous” medical advice.\n\nIn a year-long commission, the mental health charity, which operates in England and Wales, will examine the risks and safeguards required as AI increasingly influences the lives of millions of people affected by mental health issues worldwide.\n\nThe inquiry – the first of its kind globally – will bring together the world’s leading doctors and mental health professionals, as well as people with lived experience, health providers, policymakers and tech companies. Mind says it will aim to shape a safer digital mental health ecosystem, with strong regulation, standards and safeguards.\n\nThe launch comes after the Guardian revealed how people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews. The AI-generated summaries are shown to 2 billion people a month, and appear above traditional search results on the world’s most visited website.\n\nAfter the reporting, Google removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said “dangerously incorrect” mental health advice was still being provided to the public. In the worst cases, the bogus information could put lives at risk, she said.\n\nHughes said: “We believe AI has enormous potential to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, widen access to support, and strengthen public services. But that potential will only be realised if it is developed and deployed responsibly, with safeguards proportionate to the risks.\n\n“The issues exposed by the Guardian’s reporting are among the reasons we’re launching Mind’s commission on AI and mental health, to examine the risks, opportunities and safeguards needed as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life.\n\n“We want to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of people’s wellbeing, and that those of us with lived experience of mental health problems are at the heart of shaping the future of digital support.”\n\nGoogle has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut the Guardian found some AI Overviews served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. The investigation uncovered false and misleading medical advice across a range of issues, including cancer, liver disease and women’s health, as well as mental health conditions.\n\nExperts said some AI Overviews for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”.\n\nGoogle is also downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong, the Guardian found.\n\nHughes said vulnerable people were being served “dangerously incorrect guidance on mental health”, including “advice that could prevent people from seeking treatment, reinforce stigma or discrimination and in the worst cases, put lives at risk”.\n\nShe added: “People deserve information that is safe, accurate and grounded in evidence, not untested technology presented with a veneer of confidence.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email andrew.gregory@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nThe commission, which will run for a year, will gather evidence on the intersection of AI and mental health, and provide an “open space” where the experience of people with mental health conditions will be “seen, recorded and understood”.\n\nRosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, said that although Googling mental health information “wasn’t perfect” before AI Overviews, it usually worked well. She said: “Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query, and then went further – offering nuance, lived experience, case studies, quotes, social context and an onward journey to support.\n\n“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness. They give the user more of one form of clarity (brevity and plain English), while giving them less of another form of clarity (security in the source of the information, and how much to trust it). It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.\n\n“For queries where our systems identify a person might be in distress, we work to display relevant, local crisis hotlines. Without being able to review the examples referenced, we can’t comment on their accuracy.”",

    "description": "Reviews, images, and even some restaurants are missing from the map.",
    "fullText": "I use Google Maps to get from point A to point B, but I also use it for research. It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited.\n\nAs reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.\n\nIf you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n\nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.",

    "fullText": "The old saying \"Everything is bigger in Texas\" now applies to data centers.\n\nThe Lone Star State is on track to unseat Virginia as the world's largest data center market by 2030, new research from Jones Lang LaSalle shows.\n\nThe shift indicates how drastically the data center development boom has reshaped the US's digital infrastructure map and the landscape as a whole. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta plan to spend more than $600 billion on AI infrastructure expansion in 2026 — a number so dizzyingly high that Wall Street is on high alert for signs of an AI bubble.\n\nMore than half of all data center construction in the US now happens outside the industry's traditional hubs, according to JLL's North America Data Center Report — Year-End 2025. Tennessee, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Texas are now considered the top emerging markets for data centers.\n\nTexas alone has 6.5 gigawatts of data center capacity under construction.\n\nThat amount of power is roughly equivalent to more than three Hoover Dams or over 17,000 Tesla Model 3s when using the US Department of Energy's standard, and it accounts for about one-fifth of the 35 gigawatts of data center capacity the US added to its pipeline.\n\nThat 35 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of the UK or Italy, and adding it would nearly double the existing data center capacity in the US, according to JLL.\n\nPart of Texas's appeal is its sprawl.\n\nThe state houses some of the most ambitious data center projects in the country. Oracle and OpenAI's flagship Stargate data center is in Abilene, Google is planning a $40 billion expansion in West Texas, and Meta is building a massive new site in El Paso, just to name a few.\n\nTexas also has abundant energy resources, which is good news for data center developers. The AI boom has driven electricity demand to new heights and strained the nation's power grid. In Texas, several data centers — including Stargate — are being built alongside on-site power plants.\n\nNorthern Virginia has been the data center industry's central hub for more than 15 years, going back to the early days of cloud computing. That has changed rapidly as Big Tech spreads out across the country in search of available power, cheap land, and the best tax incentive packages for the coming wave of AI data centers.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "This is a great chance to get the latest budget-friendly Pixel.",
    "fullText": "Google is releasing their budget a-series version of the Pixel 10 on March 5, a whole month earlier than the 9a was released in 2025. There is not much dividing the 10a from the 9a, but there are a few software updates that can make it worth it for some people. Throw in a $100 Amazon gift card, and it's hard to say no. Google has the pre-orders for the Google 10a out already, going for $499, plus the gift card. Alternatively, you can get their Pixel Buds 2a instead of the $100 gift card for the same $499 price.\n\nLifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt actually got her hands on the Pixel 10a during a recent Google demo event. As she pointed out, the specs on the Pixel 10a are not like the Pixel 10. It's more similar to the 9 instead. It has a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage, as well as the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. The battery life is the same 30+ hours, too, and the MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone. The main upgrade here is a brighter 3,000 nits screen, a thinner bezel, and an improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass. But the value might be in the software and AI.\n\nThere are two AI camera features that debuted with the Pixel 10. One is Auto Best Take, which takes 150 frames in one click, chooses the best picture, and automatically deletes the rest (or stitches together elements from multiple shots to make a new \"best\" image). And Camera Coach, which guides you with AI on how to take the best picture. Google also brought Satellite SOS for the first time to an a-series phone. It lets you connect to a Satellite and ping emergency services for help if you have no cell signal.\n\nIf you're thinking of upgrading from a Pixel 9a or later, there's not much here to make it worth it. However, if you have anything older than a Pixel 9 or are switching to Pixel for the first time, this is a great opportunity and phone to do so.",

    "description": "Google is prepping to reveal new features in May.",
    "fullText": "Google I/O 2026 is nearly upon us. This is Google's annual opportunity to showcase the software features (and perhaps some of the hardware) the company has been cooking up behind the scenes. Like other big tech keynotes, anyone can tune in live and catch Google's latest announcements as they happen. Here's when Google I/O 2026 will kick off, and what we know about the conference at this time.\n\nGoogle tends to kick off its I/O event in May of each year, and 2026 is no different. This year, Google I/O will run May 19 through May 20. If you're used to watching one single livestream, that two-day schedule might come as a surprise. But I/O isn't just an announcement: It's a developer conference, spanning keynotes, demos, and product sessions.\n\nBut if you're only interested in the company's main keynote, you'll want to get May 19 on your calendar. Google hasn't announced the exact time for its presentation, but it usually starts at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET), based on previous years.\n\nWhile Google invites a select group of journalists to watch its presentations live, and encourages developers to register to attend its various events, you can tune into the livestream wherever you are in the world. Google hasn't confirmed where its livestreams will be hosted this year, but looking to the past, you'll likely be able to stream the keynote from the official I/O website, as well as Google's official YouTube channel.\n\nThe short answer? We don't really know! Google is keeping I/O news close to the vest, and rumors haven't been particularly prolific this year—at least, not yet. Seeing as it's only February, it's entirely possible we'll hear more about Google I/O 2026 as we get closer to May.\n\nThat said, there are some things you can expect to see regardless of leaks and rumors. Android 17 will almost assuredly take center stage at Google I/O this year. Google just released first beta for the OS on Wednesday, though it doesn't change all that much about Android 16 at this time. That said, I suspect beta testers will discover a number of new features and changes between now and May, as Google continues to add new things to its test software ahead I/O.\n\nLike the past couple of I/O's, this year should also be all about AI. Google seems to come out with new AI announcements multiple times a week, including adding its Lyria 3 AI music model to Gemini, or adding an agentic bot to Chrome to browse the internet for you. I expect Google I/O 2026 to be full of AI features—perhaps more than some of us would like to hear about.\n\nI/O 2026 could also show off some hardware, but that's no guarantee. Google did just announce the Pixel 10a, the company's latest \"budget\" phone, and it could reveal other devices in May, but I/O really is more about the software than the hardware. (It is a developer conference, after all.)",

    "description": "Lyria 3 is now available in the Gemini app. Create custom, high-quality 30-second tracks from text and images.",
    "fullText": "The Gemini app now features our most advanced music generation model Lyria 3, empowering anyone to make 30-second tracks using text or images in beta.\n\nSince launching the Gemini app, we've built tools to encourage creative expression through images and video. Today, we're taking the next step: custom music generation. Lyria 3, Google DeepMind’s latest generative music model, is rolling out today in beta in the Gemini app. Just describe an idea or upload a photo, like “a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" and in a matter of seconds, Gemini will translate it into a high-quality, catchy track. To push the creative envelope further, you can even ask Gemini to take inspiration from something you upload.\n\nLyria 3 improves on audio generation from our Lyria models in three important ways:\n\nThe Gemini app creates 30-second tracks with custom cover art generated by Nano Banana. This makes it easy to quickly share with friends by downloading or simply clicking the share link. The goal of these tracks isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\n\nCreators can also explore Lyria 3 on YouTube’s Dream Track. Available in the U.S. and now rolling out to YouTube creators in other countries, Lyria 3 will enhance the quality of each unique Shorts soundtrack. Whether it's creating a lyrical verse or a vibey backing track, being able to better customize the soundtrack will take creators’ Shorts to the next level.\n\nAll tracks generated in the Gemini app are embedded with SynthID, our imperceptible watermark for identifying Google AI-generated content. We are also giving you more tools to help identify AI content, broadening our verification capabilities in the Gemini app to include audio, along with image and video. Simply upload a file and ask if it was generated using Google AI, and Gemini will check for SynthID and use its own reasoning to return a response.\n\nSince we first launched Lyria in 2023, we've sought to develop this technology responsibly in collaboration with the music community. We've learned a lot through these collaborations and our experiments, like Music AI Sandbox, and have been very mindful of copyright and partner agreements as we've trained Lyria 3.\n\nMusic generation with Lyria 3 is designed for original expression, not for mimicking existing artists. If your prompt names a specific artist, Gemini will take this as broad creative inspiration and create a track that shares a similar style or mood. We also have filters in place to check outputs against existing content. We recognize that our approach might not be foolproof, so you can report content that may violate your rights or the rights of others. Additionally, in order to use our products, users must adhere to our Terms of Service and Gen AI prohibited use policies, which prohibit violations of others’ intellectual property and privacy rights.\n\nLyria 3 is available in the Gemini app for all users 18+ in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Portuguese, with plans to expand quality and coverage of more languages, rolling out on desktop today and to the mobile app over the next several days. And Google AI Plus, Pro and Ultra subscribers will enjoy higher limits.\n\nOur goal with music generation in the Gemini app is to help you add a fun, custom soundtrack to your daily life. Try it out today at gemini.google.com.",

    "description": "Lyria 3 means Google's AI bot now covers text, code, images, video, and songs.",
    "fullText": "Google Gemini can help you write text, generate images and video, and write code. Now, the AI bot can generate music too, taking on the likes of Suno when it comes to producing tunes from a simple text prompt. The update is courtesy of the new Lyria 3 audio generation model, which is built into Gemini as of today. Developed by Google DeepMind, Lyria has been accessible in other Google products (such as Vertex AI and YouTube Shorts) to a select number of users, but this is the first time Google is making the model widely available to anyone who wants to try it.\n\nLyria works the same way as creating images or video: just describe what you want, and the AI does the rest. You might want to hear \"a comical R&B slow jam about a sock finding their match\" (as per Google's own example), or perhaps \"a sea shanty about the dangers of AI slop\"—it's up to you.\n\nWhen you click the \"Create music\" button inside the Gemini app, you also have the option to pick an existing track to remix, rather than starting from scratch—If you're perhaps stuck for inspiration. These presets cover everything from folk ballads to Latin pop, so you can see the kind of musical scope covered. You can also supply Lyria 3 inside Gemini with an image or video, and get it to compose something that matches the mood of the content you've supplied, including both music and lyrics. The example Google gives is supplying Gemini with a few photos of your dog, and then having it come up with a tune about the pooch and their adventures.\n\nThe tracks are limited to 30 seconds each at the moment, and while music making is available to all Gemini users, if you're paying for the Plus, Pro, or Ultra subscriptions, you'll get higher usage limits (though it isn't specified what these are). As per the official announcement blog post, the aim \"isn't to create a musical masterpiece, but rather to give you a fun, unique way to express yourself.\" You're not going to be able to set up your own AI-generated band on Spotify with this, but you can churn out a few entertaining tracks for your own (or someone else's) amusement.\n\nI haven't been able to try out the feature as of yet, but I have heard a few samples that Google supplied. They come across as rather generic and ordinary, exactly as you might expect something to sound that's the averaging out of vast amounts of audio training data—like song genres distilled into their most common ingredients and repackaged.\n\nGoogle says all created tracks will contain invisible watermarks powered by SynthID, flagging them as AI creations, and you can upload audio tracks to Gemini and run a SynthID check on them. The updated Lyria 3 model is also coming to the Dream Track music maker for YouTube Shorts creators. Lyria 3 is now rolling out inside Gemini, and is available to users aged 18 and above in English, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese. It's available first on the web app, and will show up on the mobile app over the next few days. Expansions in \"quality and coverage\" are planned in the future, Google says.",

    "title": "Google's Pixel 10a Isn't Much of an Upgrade From the Pixel 9a",
    "description": "Google's newest phone looks great, but is barely an upgrade.",
    "fullText": "Early every year, Google releases a budget-oriented a-series phone that acts like a stripped down version of its latest mainline Pixel phone. The Pixel 9a, for instance, had the same chip as the Pixel 9, reduced memory and camera specs, and most importantly, a slimmed down design that finally ditched the obtrusive camera bar. The Pixel 10a, announced today, is a bit of an outlier. Instead of upgrading to the same chip as the Pixel 10, it also has the same chip as the Pixel 9, with only slight improvements to everything else that was already in the Pixel 9a. So, is it worth an upgrade?\n\nThe Pixel 10a's specs are, on paper, nearly identical to the Pixel 9a's. Both phones have a Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage. They also have the same camera system, with a 48MP main lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. Battery life also sits at the same promised 30+ hours, with a typical 5,100 mAh capacity (although charging speeds are about 3W faster, for both wired and wireless). The only real difference on paper is that the 6.3-inch screen is a little brighter, with up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness instead of 2,700. The bezels are also supposed to look about 10% thinner, although I needed to be told that to spot it during a hands-on session with the Pixel 10a.\n\nEven the Pixel 10's MagSafe-like Pixelsnap feature is gone, meaning you won't be able to use this phone with any magnetic accessories, at least without adhesive magnets or special third-party cases.\n\nThat said, there are a few changes to the hardware, notably to the look of the phone. Like the Pixel 9a, the Pixel 10a also ditches the camera bar, and evolves on Google's last budget model for a completely flat back. That means the rear camera has no bump or lip to it at all, for a completely flush and seamless feel. It's definitely clean, but the 9a's miniscule camera bump was already barely an inconvenience back when I reviewed it.\n\nMeanwhile, you'd need to be told about the other design upgrades to appreciate them. Google says the Pixel 10a has improved Corning Gorilla Glass 7i cover glass so that it's more resilient to drops and scratches, but I couldn't test that while carefully handling the company's demo units.\n\nEssentially, when looking at raw specs, the Pixel 10a comes across at first less like a stripped down version of the Pixel 10, and more like another iteration of the Pixel 9. But Google's hoping its software can win you over.\n\nThe Pixel 10a does differ from the Pixel 9a when it comes to AI, and introduces two AI camera features that debuted on the main-series Pixel 10. These are Auto Best Take and Camera Coach, although one of them is also an iteration on something that came out alongside the Pixel 8.\n\nThat would be Auto Best Take. Essentially, what this does is detect when you're in a group shot with other people, then take up to 150 frames all in one press. It'll then intelligently find the best shot from those frames and ditch the rest, and if it can't find a good shot, it'll stitch together elements from multiple shots so that everyone has their eyes open. You will know when a shot has been stitched together using Auto Best Take (it'll have a Gemini icon), and can choose to use a non-AI assisted one if you prefer. The ability to stitch together photos is a few generations behind at this point, but not having to choose when to load it up is convenient, if you're into AI-generated photos.\n\nIf you're not, Camera Coach lets you get some AI assistance in your photos without actually having AI in your shots. Essentially, this will look through your camera for you, generate an ideal shot for you to take, then guide you through the real-world steps you need to follow to recreate it. You're essentially handing off the ideation part of photography to Gemini, but you also won't have to risk any hallucinations popping up in your pics.\n\nAside from new photography features, you've also got Satellite SOS for the first time on an a-series phone. This lets you connect to a Satellite if you're away from wifi or your mobile network, so you can ping emergency services for help if you need it. Hopefully, you'll never actually have to use this feature, but it is some great piece of mind.\n\nLike the Pixel 9a, the Pixel 10a is $500, so if you're trying to choose between the two and aren't buying a 9a at a discount secondhand, it's a no-brainer. It does also have a new selection of colors, including a poppy red \"berry\" look and a purplish blue hue named Lavender.\n\nBut if you've already got a Pixel 9a and are eyeing an upgrade, it's a bit harder to justify. The biggest new additions are all software, and Google has already brought previously Pixel 10-exclusive software to older phones before (although with mixed results). That means the 9a is likely to stay relevant for a good few more years, and may actually eventually have all the same features as the 10a, minus that completely flush back.\n\nThe standard Pixel 10 series is also likely to remain a good choice. Back when I reviewed it, I thought the 9a was better than the Pixel 9, but since the 10a doesn't even have the same chip as the regular Pixel 10, it's much less likely to be able to stand in for it, however clean it looks.\n\nIf that doesn't deter you, though, you can pre-order the Pixel 10a now on Google's website, with models set to ship out and hit retail stores on March 5.",

A standard user can write a poisoned manifest to their local config directory, redirecting all sensitive extension traffic to an attacker-controlled binary.\n\nResult on Linux ext4: VULNERABLE!\n\nThis research was conducted entirely on a Chromebook — a device Google markets as “Secure by Default.” The browser completely abdicates its role as the trust authority by executing a path containing Greek Rho instead of Latin P without question.\n\nA second, distinct attack vector was discovered in the same research. Chrome does not normalize Unicode in extension names before displaying them on the chrome://extensions page.\n\nChrome renders both identically on the extensions management page. The victim believes they are looking at a legitimate Coinbase Wallet installed from a trusted system directory.\n\nThe working PoC extension demonstrates:\n\nBoth the native messaging attack and the extension naming attack exploit the same fundamental failure: Chromium does not normalize Unicode before displaying or executing it. The native messaging vulnerability achieves code execution. The extension naming vulnerability achieves social engineering. Together they demonstrate a systemic Unicode handling failure across multiple Chromium subsystems.\n\nThis disclosure was reported to 12 organizations between February 7–16, 2026. Their responses reveal a systemic industry failure: a chaotic mix of validation, denial, and abdication.\n\nThe vendor responses reveal a fundamental contradiction: Bitwarden and Cisco validate the risk and act on it, while Google — the root cause vendor — refuses to fix a vulnerability that their own downstream partners are scrambling to mitigate. Every downstream browser inherits this vulnerability permanently unless they mitigate independently.\n\nIn February 2019, Google published a whitepaper at the Munich Security Conference — a stage traditionally reserved for heads of state and defense ministers — titled “How Google Fights Disinformation.”\n\nThe paper outlined three pillars of their defense against disinformation:\n\nGoogle claimed that “impersonation and the misrepresentation of ownership” are harms they tackle at scale because they undermine the trust users place in their services.\n\nWhen presented with a working demonstration that their browser facilitates impersonation at the binary level — allowing a Greek character to masquerade as a Latin character and redirect execution of security-critical software — Google marked it WontFix.\n\nGoogle’s public stance (Munich, 2019): “We fight disinformation because fragmentation destroys societies.”\n\nGoogle’s technical reality (Chromium, 2026): “We allow homoglyph-spoofed paths to fragment the browser’s trust model because fixing it is outside our threat model.”\n\nWhen the technical evidence on Chromium Issue 482538021 became too heavy to carry, the conversation shifted from the vulnerability to the researcher. Vivaldi’s Security Group, operating on Google’s own infrastructure, posted:\n\n“We do not engage with AI. AI generated responses are not acceptable.”\n\nThis statement was made after the researcher had provided byte-level filesystem verification, working proof-of-concept code, intercepted 1Password traffic logs, and a detailed technical rebuttal of Vivaldi’s “physical access” framing.\n\nThe “AI” label was not a technical assessment. It was a kill switch. By labeling verified human research as bot-generated content, Vivaldi signaled to every other downstream vendor that the data was “noise.” They attacked the medium to avoid the message.\n\nThis is the ultimate proof of the Munich Hypocrisy: Google claims to fight the fragmentation of truth, yet they provide the platform for downstream partners to suppress legitimate security research using disinformation tactics.\n\nSince Google will not enforce normalization at the engine level, the responsibility falls on extension developers and system administrators.\n\nThis discovery is the direct result of building the TreeChain Polyglottal Cipher™ — an encryption architecture that operates across 133,387 Unicode characters and 202 languages. By mapping the behavior of the full Unicode space, we identified that the modern web’s trust model is built on a Visual Fallacy — the assumption that if two things look the same, they are the same.\n\nThe vulnerability and the fix came from the same research. Building encryption safely across the full Unicode space forced us to solve the exact problem that Chrome never thought about.\n\nGoogle’s 2019 Munich whitepaper was titled “The Great Puzzle: Who Will Pick Up the Pieces?”\n\nWhen a security researcher demonstrated that Chrome’s native messaging facilitates binary-level impersonation — the exact “misrepresentation of ownership” Google pledged to fight — the response was WontFix. When the evidence became undeniable, the conversation shifted to attacking the researcher. When downstream vendors asked who was responsible, Google said it was “by design.”\n\nThe fix is not complex. NFKC normalization is a single function call. Mixed-script detection is a solved problem. Binary integrity verification is standard practice. The tools exist. The knowledge exists. The only thing missing is the will to implement them.\n\nTreeChain Labs built the Polyglottal Cipher to encrypt data across 133,387 Unicode characters and 202 languages. In doing so, we solved this class of vulnerability architecturally — not as a patch, but as a foundational design principle.\n\nWhere Google sees an “infeasible” bug, TreeChain sees a call to build a system where identity is structural, not visual. We don’t just fight disinformation — we make it mathematically impossible.",

    "fullText": "Google, Anthropic and OpenAI bosses to mingle with global south leaders wrestling for control over technology\n\nSilicon Valley tech billionaires will land in Delhi this week for an AI summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, where leaders of the global south will wrestle for control over the fast-developing technology.\n\nDuring the week-long AI Impact Summit, attended by thousands of tech executives, government officials and AI safety experts, tech companies valued at trillions of dollars will rub along with leaders of countries such as Kenya and Indonesia, where average wages dip well below $1,000 a month.\n\nAmid a push to speed up AI adoption across the globe, Sundar Pichai, Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, the heads of Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, will all be there. Rishi Sunak and George Osborne, a former British prime minister and a former chancellor, will each be pushing for greater adoption of AI. Sunak has taken jobs for Microsoft and Anthropic and Osborne leads OpenAI’s push to deepen and widen the use of ChatGPT beyond its existing 800 million users.\n\nMeanwhile Modi, who will address the summit on Thursday, is positioning India as the AI hub for south Asia and Africa. On the agenda will be AI’s potential to transform agriculture, water supplies and public health. Governments in Kenya, Senegal, Mauritius, Togo, Indonesia and Egypt will send ministers.\n\nModi’s enthusiasm for AI has a darker side, civil liberties campaigners say. Last week they raised serious concerns about India deploying AI to increase state surveillance, discriminate against minorities and sway elections. But Modi this week spoke of “harnessing artificial intelligence for human-centric progress” and India has given the summit the strapline: “Welfare for all, happiness for all.”\n\nSummit observers talk of a battle between a new kind of AI colonialism from the US tech firms and an alternative “techno-Gandhism”, in which AI is used for social justice and to benefit marginalised people. After global AI summits in the UK, Korea and France, the Delhi meeting is the first to be held in the global south.\n\nIndian commentators say the test of AI’s value is not in its technical sophistication but whether it can improve the lives of people living in some of the toughest circumstances in the global south. By contrast, US AI companies are racing for supremacy, competing with each other and China, and rolling out AI for shopping, personal companionship and agentic systems that could slash corporate labour costs by making white-collar jobs redundant.\n\nIf a referee between the two sides is needed, António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, will speak in Delhi. This week he said it would be “totally unacceptable that AI would be just a privilege of the most developed countries or a division only between two superpowers”.\n\nIndia’s AI Impact Summit is the fourth iteration of the event, which Sunak launched in 2023 at Bletchley Park in the UK, with a focus on international coordination to prevent catastrophic risks from the most advanced AI models. Summits followed in Seoul in 2024 and Paris in 2025, where the US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to abandon the White House’s interest in safety saying: “The AI future will not be won by hand-wringing about safety; it will be won by building.”\n\nSafety is once again on the agenda, with Yoshua Bengio, one of the “godfathers” of AI, on hand to repeat his fears about the risk of powerful AI systems enabling cyber- and bioweapons attacks.\n\n“The capabilities of AI have continued to advance, and although mitigation and risk management of AI has also progressed [it has happened] not as quickly,” he said on Tuesday. “So it becomes urgent that leaders of this world understand where we could be going and it needs their attention and intervention as soon as possible.”\n\nOne of those working at the summit to make sure AI remains safe will be Nicolas Miaihle, co-founder of the AI Safety Connect group, who noted that the summit was taking place in the shadow of AI-enabled warfare in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n“The existential risks are not going anywhere,” he told the Guardian. “When Rishi Sunak started this, the race was not raging as hard. The trillions are pouring in but we are very far away from securing these models. This is profound for democracy, profound for the mental health of our kids and profound for warfare.”\n\nBut the Trump administration continues its policy of refusing to bind US AI companies with red tape. The White House is not expected to send a high-level representative to Delhi, with Sriram Krishnan, its senior AI policy adviser, the highest-ranked speaker listed in the programme.\n\n“Given where we are with the US administration it’s pretty unlikely you’re going to have a massive breakthrough on any consensus on what a regulatory framework will look like,” said one senior AI company source.\n\nCompanies such as Google are focused on the use of AI in education in India, where large language models’ ability to function in many of the country’s dozens of languages is an advantage.\n\n“[There’s] a big focus on access and adoption, how can you make sure that the technology is available as broadly as possible,” said Owen Larter, head of frontier AI policy and public affairs at Google DeepMind. “We’re excited on the education front in India. It’s a remarkable story of an incredibly intense adoption. About 90% of teachers and students already using AI in their learning. We’ve had a big promotional programme where 2 million students have access to our pro subscription for free.”\n\nGoogle’s investments in India include a $15bn spend, in partnership with the conglomerate of Gautam Adani, one of India’s richest billionaires, on an gigawatt-scale AI datacentre hub in the coastal city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh, with subsea cables connecting to other parts of the world.",

    "fullText": "If you use Google Chrome, you should install the latest update ASAP. Google has issued a patch for a high-severity flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day in 2026.\n\nThe latest flaw, catalogued as CVE-2026-2441, is a use-after-free vulnerability in CSSFontFeatureValuesMap, Chrome's CSS font feature implementation. A use-after-free vulnerability is a flaw in which an application attempts to use memory after it has been released back to the system. This type of bug allows attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, cause app or system crashes, and leak sensitive data.\n\nCVE-2026-2441 would allow \"a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code inside a sandbox via a crafted HTML page.\" Essentially, this means malicious HTML content could run code inside a Chrome tab, extension, or plugin. As Malwarebytes explains, this is dangerous because attackers can see or modify whatever the isolated browser tab (sandbox) can access, allowing actions like credential harvesting and traffic rerouting—even if it cannot escape to impact the whole operating system.\n\nGoogle said that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild but hasn't provided any specific details as to how. The discovery has been attributed to Shaheen Fazim.\n\nGoogle released a Stable channel update on Feb. 13 with a patch for this flaw. The latest versions of Chrome are 145.0.7632.75/76 for Windows and macOS and 144.0.7559.75 for Linux, so you'll want to ensure you are up to date. Go to the Chrome menu and select About Google Chrome to check which version you're on.\n\nChrome updates automatically when you close and reopen the browser, but if you don't do that regularly, keep an eye out for pending updates in the top-right corner of your browser window. Apply these updates immediately by tapping the three dots and selecting the first menu item. Chrome will need to restart to complete the update.",

    "description": "Anthropic's Claude AI has snatched headlines recently. But is there another model that is throwing a wrench in the AI trade?",
    "fullText": "While Anthropic's Claude AI has snatched headlines recently for disrupting the software industry, one researcher says there's perhaps an even bigger bogeyman lurking in tech.\n\nTom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, says Google's Gemini threatens major potential disruptions to how investors currently see major AI firms.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, Essaye highlighted three risks posed by Gemini, in particular its November update.\n\nThe first is that it could take market share from OpenAI's ChatGPT. That, in turn, could hurt OpenAi's ability to deliver on the $1 trillion in spending it has promised to firms like Nvidia, he said.\n\nSecond, the fact that Google used its own chips to build Gemini could undermine the importance of large semiconductor providers.\n\n\"The reason that Nvidia, Broadcom, Taiwan Semi and others have exploded in recent years was because of insatiable demand for their semiconductor chips, as they are necessary to build out LLMs,\" Essaye wrote. \"Google making their own chips implies demand for chips from NVDA, AVGO and TSMC may be less than expected. That means less earnings growth and a lower multiple for semiconductor stocks.\"\n\nThat leads to the third point: since Gemini is so effective and was cheaper to produce than other leading chatbots, investors are holding spending levels from hyperscalers to a higher degree of scrutiny, Essaye said.\n\n\"If Google can make Gemini as good as ChatGPT on its own chips, then others likely can as well. The fear is that AI becomes commoditized, making trillions of dollars in AI infrastructure investment foolish,\" Essaye wrote.\n\n\"Put plainly, Gemini broke the idea that all money spent on AI was 'good' money that would result in earnings growth,\" he continued. \"Instead, it ushered in scrutiny to AI capex spending and that altered the paradigm AI/tech stocks existed in. Practically, that means it's no longer the case that the company that spends the most on AI infrastructure 'wins' and we can see that in the market reaction to the collapse of mega-cap free cash flow.\"",

    "description": "Meet Sundar Pichai, the man leading Google and Alphabet as CEO, who is leading the search giant through the AI race.",
    "fullText": "Sundar Pichai has had a meteoric rise since joining Google as a 31-year-old product manager in 2004.\n\nIn the 11 years that followed his first steps on the Googleplex, Pichai was promoted four times, eventually becoming the CEO of Google in 2015.\n\nIn that role, he was responsible for the company's core businesses and cash cow — and did a good enough job that, in December 2019, he was promoted one more time, replacing Google cofounder Larry Page as the CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company.\n\nSince then, he has led the almost-$2-trillion company through the pandemic, layoffs, and the AI renaissance that's taken Silicon Valley by storm.\n\nSo, who is Pichai, and how did he scale the ranks to get one of the most important jobs at one of the most important companies in the world? Here's a look at his life and career.\n\nPichai, whose full name is actually Pichai Sundararajan, grew up in Chennai, India.\n\nPichai's father was an electrical engineer, and his mother worked as a stenographer before having him and his younger brother. The family wasn't wealthy, and the boys slept together in the living room of their two-room apartment.\n\nEarly on, Pichai's family realized he had a talent for remembering numbers after noticing he could recall every phone number he had ever dialed on their rotary phone. He has been known to sometimes show off his memorization skills at meetings, Bloomberg said in 2014.\n\nAfter becoming interested in computers — the first software program he wrote was a chess game — Pichai studied engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur. His success there won him a scholarship to Stanford University.\n\nPichai earned a master's degree from Stanford and later attended the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School for his MBA.\n\nPichai has said that moving to California was a huge leap.\n\n\"I always loved technology growing up,\" Pichai said in a 2014 interview at Delhi University. \"I used to read about what was happening in Silicon Valley, and I wanted to be a part of it.\"\n\nWhen Pichai got to America in 1993, he couldn't believe how expensive everything was.\n\nHe \"was in an absolute state of shock\" about the price of a backpack — $60 — he told Bloomberg.\n\nHe also missed his girlfriend, Anjali. The two eventually married and now have a son, Kiran, and daughter, Kavya.\n\nBefore Google, he had stints at semiconductor manufacturer Applied Materials and consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nPichai had his first interview at Google on April Fools' Day in 2004 — the same day it launched Gmail. Pichai has said he initially thought the free email service was one of Google's famous pranks.\n\nPichai got his start working as a VP of product management, focused on Google's Toolbar, a web-search feature on Internet Explorer and Firefox.\n\nOne of his early achievements: convincing Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin that Google should build its own web browser.\n\nIn 2006, Microsoft created a \"doomsday\" scenario for Google by making Bing the new default search engine on Internet Explorer. To mitigate the effect of this change, Pichai helped convince Google execs to create its own browser, Google Chrome.\n\nChrome is now the world's most popular browser.\n\nAs a leader at Google, Pichai was known to be well-liked and focused on results, which resulted in more responsibility.\n\nPichai's \"substance over overt style\" approach was, in part, what led to Pichai taking over the Android division in 2013.\n\nHe spearheaded Android One, Google's push to \"make high-quality smartphones accessible to as many people as possible,\" and was also instrumental in ensuring Android was better integrated with Google.\n\nPichai was also behind Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's inexpensive Chromebook laptops, and was reportedly instrumental in helping put together Google's $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest in 2014.\n\nHis success garnered attention, and he was reportedly approached for a leadership role at Twitter.\n\nWhen Pichai turned down Twitter, he was rewarded for his allegiance, getting $50 million and a promotion.\n\nAs he rose through the ranks, Pichai became the right-hand man of Google cofounder and former CEO Larry Page.\n\n\"He's like the Aaron to Larry's Moses,\" a source told Business Insider in 2014, referring to the biblical prophet's brother.\n\nThat relationship and his success led to Pichai's next important promotion in late 2014 when Page put him in charge of the company's core products.\n\nAfter proving himself with Chrome and Android, Pichai added Google+, Maps, Search, commerce and ads, and infrastructure to his portfolio. The move cemented Pichai's move as Page's second-in-command.\n\n\"Sundar has a tremendous ability to see what's ahead and mobilize teams around the super important stuff,\" Page wrote in a memo announcing Pichai's promotion. \"We very much see eye-to-eye when it comes to product, which makes him the perfect fit for this role.\"\n\nWhen Alphabet was established as Google's parent company in 2015, Pichai was made CEO at Google, which encompassed search, YouTube, and Android.\n\nIn July 2017, Pichai was named to Alphabet's board of directors.\n\n\"Sundar has been doing a great job as Google's CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation. I really enjoy working with him, and I'm excited that he is joining the Alphabet board,\" Page said at the time.\n\nTwo years later came his final promotion at the company. Alphabet's CEO, Page, and president, Sergey Brin, announced that they were stepping down, and Pichai would become Alphabet's CEO.\n\nPage and Brin cofounded Google in 1998. They announced the change in a letter saying that Alphabet and Google \"no longer need two CEOs and a President.\"\n\nPichai earned a total of $226 million in 2022, with his pay spiking thanks to a multi-year stock award granted that year, making him one of America's best-paid CEOs.\n\nIn fiscal year 2024, Pichai earned $10.73 million in total compensation.\n\nPichai became a billionaire in 2025, according to the the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe top job at Alphabet also comes with increased public and internal scrutiny.\n\nIn 2018, the House Judiciary Committee grilled the CEO about Google's data privacy practices and plans with China.\n\nTwo years later, Pichai testified in front of Congress again over antitrust concerns. Two other major Google lawsuits were later filed by the US government over its alleged monopoly tactics.\n\nIn August 2024, a federal judge ruled against Google, finding the company had violated antitrust law to keep a monopoly on search.\n\nWhen penalties were announced in September 2025, Google was not forced to sell off its Chrome browser despite the Justice Department's request for that remedy. The judge ruled Google could no longer have exclusive search deals, and the company's stock jumped following the announcement.\n\nGoogle also dealt with internal turmoil after letting go of one of its top AI ethicists.\n\nIn December 2020, Google fired Timnit Gebru. Her exit came weeks after she was asked to retract a paper on the dangers of large language models and spoke out against the company's treatment of minority employees.\n\nGoogle employees were \"seriously pissed\" over how the firing was handled, one told BI at the time, and Gebru said that Pichai and other managers helped create \"hostile work environments.\"\n\nPichai eventually apologized for how the company dealt with it.\n\n\"I want to say how sorry I am for that, and I accept the responsibility of working to restore your trust,\" he wrote.\n\nAlso in 2020, Pichai was at the forefront of Google's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under his leadership, Google launched initiatives to help search users find accurate, useful information about the coronavirus.\n\nAnd like many large tech companies, Alphabet recruited rapidly at the start of the pandemic. Alphabet hired nearly 37,000 new workers in the 12 months leading up to October 2022.\n\nBut from late 2022, Pichai had to oversee an era of cost-cutting at the company.\n\nThat culminated in job losses in January 2023, when Google layoffs affected 12,000 employees or 6% of its global workforce. Pichai said he took \"full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.\"\n\nOver 1,400 Google employees wrote an open letter to Pichai about how the layoffs were handled.\n\n\"Don't be evil,\" it read, a reference to the company's original motto.\n\nGooglers also criticized Pichai's big payday in the face of the job cuts, accusing him of \"destroying morale and culture\" at Google.\n\nGoogle also laid off hundreds more workers in its central engineering division and hardware team in early 2024.\n\nJob cuts continued into 2025, with the company flattening its management layer and shedding roles in its Cloud unit. In February 2026, Business Insider reported Google was offering buyouts to staff in its business unit who aren't \"all in.\"\n\nPichai has also had to deal with European regulatory issues. French regulators hit Google with a roughly $270 million fine in March 2024, accusing the company of using news outlet articles to train its Gemini AI model.\n\nPichai has also pushed Google forward in the AI arms race that's preoccupying Silicon Valley.\n\nGoogle issued a \"code red\" in December 2022 after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT sparked concerns about the future of its search engine and whether chatbots might replace it. Pichai redirected resources to focus on building Google's AI products.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Pichai expressed interest in the technology, though. In 2016, Pichai announced that Google would be an \"AI-first\" company. Two years later, he said it's \"one of the most important things that humanity is working on\" and \"more profound\" than \"electricity or fire.\"\n\nGoogle's AI efforts have resulted in its own chatbot.\n\nIn December 2023, Google's Gemini launched. Gemini is a multimodal AI model that can process images, text, audio, video, and coding languages.\n\nPichai has also shifted Google's focus to integrating AI into its other products.\n\nAt the 2023 Google I/O conference, the CEO announced that Google would add AI features across Google Workspace, including in Search, Gmail, Docs, and other products.\n\nGoogle's traditional search function has also become an AI product, with AI overviews rolling out in 2024.\n\nAlphabet has continued to invest heavily in AI.\n\nOn an earnings call in February 2026, Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, with its spending expected to reach between $175 billion and $185 billion. Much of that was expected to go towards building out AI infrastructure, like chips and data centers.\n\nThe company also announced the Gemini app had over 750 million monthly active users, up 100 million from October.\n\nWhile Pichai is quite private, he is known to start his day with a cup of tea and an omelet — plus a copy of The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"I read the physical paper every single morning,\" he told Recode in 2016, adding that he reads The New York Times online.\n\nThe Pichai's morning routine also includes scrolling through TechMeme, a niche tech news website that aggregates the latest stories in tech published by media outlets.\n\nAlthough he's private, Pichai has spoken out about certain causes since he became a public figure.\n\nIn 2015, he responded to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's suggestion that Muslims be barred from immigrating to the US.\n\n\"Let's not let fear defeat our values. We must support Muslim and other minority communities in the US and around the world,\" he wrote.\n\nPichai was among the Big Tech executives who attended Trump's inauguration in 2025. Google also donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nPichai is seen as something of a hero in his home country of India.\n\n\"You are what they would like to be, an Indian who studied here, went overseas, and did what everyone would dream of doing,\" interviewer Harsha Bhogle said in a conversation with Pichai for students at Delhi University.\n\nIn 2020, Pichai announced that Google would invest $10 billion into India's tech sector over the next five to seven years to make the internet \"affordable and useful\" to everyone living in the country.\n\nJillian D'Onfro, Avery Hartmans, and Mary Meisenzahl contributed to an earlier version of this article.",

    "fullText": "As Gavin Newsom departs, ultra-wealthy flex wealth and influence to fight regulation and keep the boom going\n\nTech billionaires are leveraging tens of millions of dollars to influence California politics in a marked uptick from their previous participation in affairs at the state capitol. Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).\n\nThe phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico has dubbed “the big tech flex”.\n\nGavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That means Silicon Valley needs to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.\n\nSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.\n\n“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.\n\nRather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.\n\n“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”\n\nUnlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and instead spent big and broad at the federal level (aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive $200m ballot measure campaign in 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.\n\nRobert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.\n\n“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”\n\nThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is a proposal that would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.\n\nWhen the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.\n\nSome opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas, vowing to leave California for good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.\n\nThiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founder handed over $3m to the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.\n\n“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”\n\nTech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.\n\nJust this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor, wrote “the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase, wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.\n\nAdding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator, wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”\n\nJoining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsom told the New York Times in January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”\n\nOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.\n\nMcCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.\n\n“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”\n\nMeta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The company contributed $45m to one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.\n\nThe social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry, according to Politico.\n\nThe crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group called Grow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsen told the New York Times he plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.\n\n“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple, told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”\n\nWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has already experienced many of these same tactics at the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.\n\nThe California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.\n\nSingleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.\n\nBut then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose, announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.\n\nMahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.\n\nMahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.\n\nGoogle’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.\n\nAs political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.\n\n“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said. That’s for sure.”",

    "title": "14 More Lessons from 14 years at Google",
    "description": "More lessons learned from 14 years of engineering at Google, focusing on what truly matters beyond just writing great code.",
    "fullText": "A while back, I wrote down 21 lessons from my time at Google. The response caught me off guard because of which ones stuck. It wasn’t tech-specific advice. It was the stuff about people, decisions, and the messy reality of building things together.\n\nThat made me realize I’d left a lot on the table. The first list skewed toward individual craft - how to write better code, how to think about your career. But some of the hardest lessons I’ve learned aren’t about how you work. They’re about how teams work: how decisions actually get made, where coordination breaks down, what separates the groups that ship from the ones that spin.\n\nThese lessons pick up where the first left off. They’re less about being a better individual engineer and more about the systems around the engineering.\n\nEvery yes is an implicit no to something else.\n\nI’ve watched talented engineers burn out because they said yes to everything - every bug, every feature request, every “quick favor.” Their calendar filled up with other people’s priorities, and their own roadmap became a graveyard of half-finished ideas.\n\nSometimes it’s just because they truly do care so much about the product. Protect your bandwidth from “nice to have” the same way you protect production from outages. The skill is doing the right things and letting the wrong things stay undone.\n\nThe engineers who create disproportionate impact aren’t necessarily faster or smarter. They’re more ruthless about what deserves their attention. They’ve learned that the opportunity cost of working on the wrong thing is working on the wrong thing.\n\nMost meetings fail not because they’re unnecessary, but because they’re disguised journaling. I’ve sat through hundreds of hours where smart people talked around a problem without ever naming what they needed. The meeting ends with vibes and no owner.\n\nI learned to start with the ask: approve, choose, unblock, or inform.\n\nJust those four words changed how I prepare for every meeting. If I can’t pick one, I’m not ready to take anyone’s time. And when I’m on the receiving end, I’ve started asking “what decision do you need from me?” within the first two minutes. It sounds blunt, but people are usually relieved - they often didn’t realize they hadn’t defined it themselves.\n\nThe hidden cost of vague meetings isn’t just the hour you lose. It’s the week of drift that follows while everyone waits for clarity that never came.\n\nThe difference between motion and progress is specificity.\n\nTeams drown in intentions. I’ve watched roadmaps fill up with “we should improve the onboarding flow” and “we should reduce latency” and “we should document the API.” Months later, the same items are still there, gathering dust and guilt. You might think that’s a solved problem now that we have agentic engineering, but not quite.\n\nConvert talk into the smallest next action someone can actually do, then put a name and a date on it. Not “we should improve onboarding” but “On Tuesday, Sarah will run three user sessions and document the top friction points.”\n\nThis is about respecting that humans need traction to make progress. Vague intentions create anxiety. Specific commitments create momentum. The plan doesn’t have to be perfect - it just has to be concrete enough that someone can actually start.\n\nSpeed is about removing the friction that makes smart people hesitate. “Bias towards action” when you can.\n\nWhen a project drags, the instinct is to blame velocity: people aren’t working hard enough, the codebase is messy, there aren’t enough engineers. But in my experience, slow code is often a symptom. Slow decisions are the disease.\n\nIf decisions routinely take weeks or months, look deeper. Missing context means people can’t evaluate tradeoffs. Unclear ownership means everyone’s waiting for someone else to decide. Fear of accountability means people hedge instead of commit.\n\nThe fastest engineering team I ever worked with wasn’t the one with the best programmers. It was the one where decisions happened in hours instead of weeks because the authority was clear, the context was shared, and being wrong wasn’t a career risk.\n\nUsers don’t praise reliability but they do notice its absence.\n\nThis creates a dangerous dynamic: reliability work is invisible until it fails, which means it’s perpetually under-resourced compared to shiny new features.\n\nError budgets are one way to make the tradeoff explicit. If your service has an SLO of 99.9% uptime, you have a “budget” of 0.1% downtime to spend on innovation. Burn through it, and you focus on reliability until you’ve earned it back. This is a framework for having honest conversations about risk.\n\nThe teams that maintain both velocity and reliability don’t do it through heroics. They do it by treating reliability as a first-class product feature with its own roadmap, its own metrics, and its own advocates.\n\nYou wouldn’t ship a feature without product review. Don’t ship a system without some kind of reliability discussion.\n\nTeam interaction modes exist for a reason: collaboration (working closely together), service (clear API and SLAs), or facilitation (one team helping another build capability).\n\nMost cross-team pain isn’t about effort or good intentions. It’s about unclear boundaries and messy contracts. I’ve watched teams “improve communication” by adding more meetings, more Slack channels, more syncs - and it doesn’t make things better.\n\nThe problem isn’t that people aren’t talking. It’s that the interface between teams is undefined. Who owns what? What’s the contract? What can team A depend on team B for, and vice versa?\n\nChoose deliberately, and you’ll need fewer meetings to make things work. Try to paper over a bad interface with communication, and you’ll burn out your most collaborative people while the underlying dysfunction remains.\n\n“Here’s the problem” is half the job. I used to think my role was to identify issues and bring them to leadership. That’s necessary but insufficient.\n\n“Here are two options, the tradeoffs, and what I recommend” is how you get unblocked and earn trust. It shows you’ve done the thinking. It gives decision-makers something super specific to react to instead of an open-ended problem to solve.\n\nIt makes their job easier, which makes them more likely to give you what you need.\n\nThe difference between “I need help” and “I need you to choose between A and B, and here’s why I lean toward B” is the difference between being a problem-raiser and being a problem-solver.\n\nBoth identify issues. Only one earns increasing trust and autonomy.\n\nThe hero is burned out, undocumented, and a single point of failure.\n\nIf one person saving the day is a recurring pattern, that’s a failure mode rather than a badge of honor. I’ve seen teams celebrate their heroes while ignoring the dysfunction that made heroism necessary.\n\nWhen they leave - and they always leave eventually - the team discovers that no one else really knows how things work. The celebration of heroism masks a systemic problem: the path for “normal humans on a normal day” doesn’t work.\n\nMake the normal path the default. Document the system. Spread the knowledge. Design for the average Tuesday, not the exceptional crisis. Heroes should be unnecessary, and if they’re necessary, you should be working to make them unnecessary.\n\nA feature without telemetry is a liability in disguise.\n\nIf you ship a feature without knowing how it behaves in production, you shipped uncertainty.\n\nI’ve watched teams celebrate launches only to discover weeks later that their feature was silently failing for 20% of users. They had no logs, no metrics, no dashboards but a gap where understanding should be. This can cause all kinds of pain if you want to fix it, including unshipping just to properly A/B test with observability in place.\n\nLogs, traces, dashboards, and alerts aren’t “ops work.” They’re how you learn. They’re how you know whether the thing you built actually works for real people doing real things in real conditions.\n\nThe best engineers I know treat observability as part of the definition of done. Not “I wrote the code” but “I wrote the code and I can see it working.”\n\nSmall changes are easier to review, easier to reason about, and easier to revert.\n\nI used to write large pull requests. I liked the idea of a complete feature being reviewable at once. I was optimizing for my convenience at the expense of my reviewers’ sanity. Smaller PRs are often better for everyone.\n\nThey ship faster because they don’t sit in a review queue while someone tries to find an hour to understand your thousand-line diff. If you want teammates to trust your pace, make your work reviewable.\n\nThe hidden benefit is that small PRs force you to think in increments. Instead of one monolithic change, you build up capability piece by piece. Each piece gets feedback. Each piece can be rolled back independently. It’s slower per-PR but faster to actual production.\n\nCoordination cost grows faster than headcount.\n\nThis is why “just throw more people at the problem” often fails, and why adding heads late in a project can make it later. Every new person adds communication overhead with everyone they need to coordinate with. The graph gets denser, not just larger.\n\nI’ve seen managers genuinely puzzled when a team doubled in size but output barely changed. The answer is always the same: the new edges ate the new capacity. More people meant more alignment meetings, more context-sharing, more waiting for decisions that now required more stakeholders.\n\nThe solution isn’t to stop hiring. It’s to be intentional about reducing edges. Clear ownership. Autonomous teams with minimal dependencies. Interfaces that let people work in parallel instead of in lockstep. The best organizations aren’t the ones with the most people - they’re the ones with the most leverage per person.\n\nEvery migration is a negotiation between the system you have, the system you want, and the people who didn’t ask for either.\n\nI’ve seen migrations estimated at one quarter stretch to years. Not because the technical work was wrong, but because nobody accounted for the human work: convincing teams to prioritize your migration over their roadmap, supporting the long tail of edge cases nobody knew existed, and maintaining two systems in parallel while the old one refuses to die.\n\nThe technical plan is the easy part. The hard part is designing for coexistence. You will run old and new simultaneously for longer than you think. You will discover that the “legacy” system encodes decisions nobody documented and workflows nobody remembers designing but everyone depends on. You will need a adoption strategy that doesn’t require every team to drop what they’re doing at once.\n\nThe migrations that actually finish share three traits: a sponsor who stays engaged past the kickoff, a team that really owns the migration instead of treating it as a side quest, and a clear deprecation date that people believe is real. Without all three, you get a migration that’s perpetually “almost done” - which is worse than not starting, because now you’re paying the cost of two systems indefinitely.\n\nIf you’re not willing to fund the finish, don’t start the migration.\n\nEveryone can generate code now. The barrier to producing code, content, designs - it’s largely collapsing. AI will write you ten versions of anything in the time it used to take to write one.\n\nThe differentiator is choosing: what to build, what to delete, what to simplify, what not to ship, and what “good” looks like. Taste - the ability to distinguish between options and pick the right one - becomes the scarce resource.\n\nUse AI to explore options fast, then apply judgment ruthlessly. The engineers who thrive in this environment won’t be the ones who generate the most. They’ll be the ones who curate the best.\n\nProduction is cheap. Editing is expensive. Selection is everything.\n\nThis is the highest-leverage thing you can build. Not a system but credibility.\n\nWhen people trust you, they don’t need five meetings to approve a decision. They assume competence, good intent, and follow-through. Decisions that would take weeks in a low-trust environment take hours in a high-trust one.\n\nEvery time you deliver on a promise, every time you’re honest about a mistake, every time you make someone else’s life easier, you’re depositing into an account that will pay dividends for years.\n\nI’ve watched engineers with modest technical skills accomplish enormous things because everyone trusted them. I’ve watched brilliant engineers accomplish little because nobody would take their calls.\n\nThe code doesn’t matter if you can’t get anyone to ship it with you.\n\nThe first time around, I said these lessons come down to staying curious, staying humble, and remembering that the work is about people. I still believe that.\n\nBut if this second list has a through-line, it’s something more specific: the work is about making it easier for normal people to do extraordinary things on a normal day. A career in engineering gives you plenty of time to learn these things the hard way and I’ve certainly learned a lot during my time at Google so far.\n\nI hope a few of them save you a scar or two. And if they do, share what you’ve figured out with someone earlier in the journey.\n\nThat’s how the good lessons travel.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "title": "Billionaire Google founder sparks backlash after pulling $450 million megayacht into US port: 'Burned through'",
    "description": "It turns heads for its massive size and luxury.",
    "fullText": "While millions of Americans worry about rising home energy costs, one $450 million megayacht consumes enough electricity each day to supply about 800 homes.\n\nThe colossal 466-foot-long vessel was on stark display in early December, docked during the Art Basel 2025 show in Miami Beach. Called Dragonfly, the megayacht is owned by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who sailed it into Florida for the elite art showcase.\n\nWith a status as one of the largest private yachts in the world, Luxurylaunches described Dragonfly as \"something closer to a floating skyscraper than a yacht.\" The vessel has enough space to house up to 18 guests — and a 40-member crew.\n\nWhile Brin visited Art Basel, his docked megayacht continued to run its extensive energy-hungry systems — including air conditioning, lights, IT infrastructure, security systems, and more. The result is a concerning environmental impact that shows the gap between the ultra-wealthy and the average American.\n\nTogether, all of Dragonfly's luxe megayacht accommodations consume electricity at a rate equivalent to powering hundreds of average Florida homes per day. Experts told Luxurylaunches that on a heavy operational day, Dragonfly can consume an estimated 28,800 kilowatt-hours in 24 hours. The average Florida household uses about 1,104 kilowatt-hours per month.\n\n\"Dragonfly's single day at the dock equals the daily electricity use of roughly 780 to 800 Florida households,\" the outlet noted. \"Look at it another way, and it is about 26 Florida households' entire monthly consumption, burned through in 24 hours.\"\n\nWith electricity totaling an estimated $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, Luxurylaunches noted that Dragonfly's electricity bill alone comes to roughly $8,640 per day. Dragonfly runs on a hybrid diesel-electric system, which helps offset some of its environmental impact — but certainly not enough to classify it as environmentally clean or neutral.\n\nAs many communities face rising energy costs and feel the burdens of rising global pollution, the ultra-wealthy continue to burn resources at an astonishing — and largely unchecked — scale.\n\nThis massive consumption simply for pure luxury undercuts collective efforts to slow rising global temperatures. Stronger climate policy, true accountability, and greater investment in clean energy are needed to help address resource overuse and the growing damage superyachts cause to our oceans.\n\nAll superyachts also have outsized impacts on marine ecosystems and human health, regardless of whether they are electric, hybrid, or powered entirely by dirty energy. Beyond harmful carbon pollution, superyachts release wastewater, generate plastic waste, and flood marine environments with artificial light.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNotably, superyachts also generate a great deal of noise pollution, an often overlooked threat that experts warn can be as damaging as air pollution. Research links chronic noise exposure to hearing loss, sleep disruption, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and developmental delays in children.\n\nAt sea, excessive noise can interfere with whale and dolphin communication, placing species that depend on sound for navigation, feeding, and survival at risk.\n\nDragonfly may turn heads for its massive size and luxury, but its harmful environmental impact is impossible to ignore. As the realities of environmental pollution become increasingly dire, the extreme excess of superyachts like Dragonfly shows how the wealthy can sidestep environmental responsibility — while contributing to global pollution on a scale few others ever could.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless.\n\nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.\n\nThe feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)\n\nYou'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.\n\nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.\n\nApple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "fullText": "He worked in Big Tech. Now, he fears half of its software engineers are on the chopping block.\n\nSteve Yegge worked with Jeff Bezos in Amazon's early years. Then he went to Google, where he worked for over 12 years and earned the title of senior staff software engineer. He also knows a thing or two about AI engineering, having written a book on the topic titled \"Vibe Coding.\"\n\nOn \"The Pragmatic Engineer\" podcast and newsletter, Yegge described an imaginary dial of the percentage of engineering staff a company can lay off, ranging from zero to 100. He said he believes the dial is being set at 50 in the age of AI.\n\n\"You're going to have to get rid of half of them to make the other half maximally productive,\" Yegge said. \"We're going to lose around half the engineers from big companies, which is scary\".\n\nThere's a capital-to-labor tradeoff happening in tech. Companies are paying vast sums for tokens and enterprise AI licenses, GPUs, and computing capacity. That money needs to come from somewhere — and for some, it could come from labor costs.\n\nYegge pointed to this tradeoff as the reason for his forecast of 50% cuts becoming the norm. Companies will lay off some engineers to help pay for the others to have adequate access to AI, he said.\n\nHost Gergely Orosz said that 50% cuts would be more than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when tech went through an intense layoff cycle.\n\n\"It's going to be way bigger,\" Yegge said. \"It's going to be awful.\"\n\nThey aren't the only ones referencing the pandemic. In a popular X article, HyperWrite CEO Matt Shumer wrote that AI's impact on work would be \"much, much bigger than Covid.\"\n\nIn recent years, the question of AI-driven layoffs has haunted workers at Big Tech companies, many of which went on a hiring spree during the pandemic. While it's often impossible to boil job loss down a single reason, many suspect productivity gains from AI and ballooning capex spending are fueling the cuts. Some business leaders have also explicitly cited AI when announcing layoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, tech leaders describe smaller teams working more efficiently. On a recent earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said one engineer could now do the work of a whole team, thanks to AI.\n\nAs AI productivity grows, so have complaints of AI fatigue. Software engineer Siddhant Khare penned a lengthy essay about growing more productive, but also feeling more drained than ever. He told Business Insider that he felt like a \"reviewer\" as opposed to an engineer.\n\nYegge said it's not all bad news for the engineers — just those who want to work at a big company. Engineers who have \"seen the light\" are now getting together, leaving their companies, and creating startups that outpace the industry's giants, he said.\n\n\"We've got this mad rush of innovation coming up, bottom up,\" he said. \"And we've got knowledge workers being laid off by big companies because clearly big businesses are not the right size anymore.\"",

In recent years, Alphabet has made significant strides in AI, launching Gemini 3 in 2025 as its most advanced model yet, requiring less prompting and delivering smarter responses.\n\nOther advances include the Ironwood AI chip (its seventh-generation TPU) for scaling large models, Gemma 3 for efficient open-source AI, SIMA 2 for AI agents in 3D worlds, and integrations like AI Mode in Search and Gemini Robotics for physical interactions. These innovations bolster its cloud and ad businesses amid the AI boom.\n\nAlphabet's stock is up 1% year-to-date (YTD), just slightly underperforming the S&P 500's ($SPX) 1.89% YTD gain, but over the past year, GOOGL has surged 69%, far exceeding the index's 15% return. Valuation metrics show a trailing P/E of 30.65, a forward P/E of 29.64, and a price/sales of 9.93. Compared to its 10-year historical average P/E of 27.69, it currently trades 7% higher, suggesting a premium. Versus peers (average P/E 31.5x), it's attractive but expensive relative to the interactive media industry average of 12x.",

    "description": "AI agents could eventually take on a lot of tasks done by humans. Yet hallucinations present a challenge currently, says a former Google exec.",
    "fullText": "Despite some CEOs' enthusiasm, AI agents aren't always up to the task.\n\nAgents are software programs that can perform tasks independently, such as reconciling an invoice, so that a person doesn't have to. Sounds great, right? That's why companies are plugging agents into tasks across sales, finance, supply chains, and engineering.\n\nYet while agentic systems can be effective at completing discrete tasks, they can be fragile at scale.\n\nErrors can quickly become a bottleneck if hallucinations multiply when agents interact, said Nicolas Darveau-Garneau, a former Google executive and author of the book \"Be a Sequoia, Not a Bonsai.\"\n\nIf a single agent has a 5% hallucination rate, then it's hard to daisy-chain multiple agents without a high risk of errors. That's because the risk increases exponentially, he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The only way we get massive productivity gains is the day that we can trust that the AI is not hallucinating a lot,\" Darveau-Garneau said.\n\nFor now, he said, that's why general-purpose, autonomous agentic AI is largely aspirational.\n\nNevertheless, hallucinations are something that Darveau-Garneau expects will be \"mostly solved\" five years from now.\n\nIf that happens, he said, the productivity gains of 10% to 30% that some companies are getting from AI could be far greater — perhaps on the order of 10x to 100x.\n\nThose gains matter because the bigger they get, the more likely it becomes that companies will reorganize their operations, including the possibility of needing fewer employees.\n\nEven if companies don't cut staff, many roles — especially desk jobs — are likely to change.\n\nThe challenge of scaling agents and AI broadly is one reason Darveau-Garneau expects companies to still need some humans in jobs that sometimes appear to be endangered, like coding.\n\nAn excellent software engineer, he said, might be 30% to 40% more productive with AI. It's a nice lift, Darveau-Garneau said, but not a reason for a company to get rid of all its engineers.\n\nWorkers are understandably fearful of losing their jobs to AI, especially when leaders emphasize productivity gains, he said.\n\nDarveau-Garneau said that the CEO's primary job when it comes to AI is to create the right environment for adoption — including training and making sure that employees feel \"psychologically safe.\"\n\nThat's why, he said, leaders would be wise to reframe the conversation to say they want to double a company's size, for example, while increasing the employee base by 30%, rather than suggesting they deploy AI and cut 20% of the staff.\n\nOne challenge for many leaders has been understanding what new roles will look like thanks to AI, Muqsit Ashraf, group chief executive of strategy at Accenture, told Business Insider.\n\nThat is proving difficult, at least in part, because some current job descriptions may change, and other jobs may become redundant. Still others will have to be \"radically redefined,\" he said.\n\n\"What companies have been doing, by and large, is putting AI in the hands of people in their existing roles with existing tasks,\" Ashraf said.\n\nThat might mean automating some tasks or using AI to supercharge how someone searches for information or how quickly they can conduct a competitive analysis.\n\n\"But how does that fundamentally change my day?\" he said.\n\nCompanies have struggled, Ashraf said, if they've tended to think about adopting AI within their current ways of working, rather than redesigning the organization with an eye toward future jobs.\n\n\"It's not about layering AI on existing roles. It's about rethinking all of these processes and activities,\" he said.\n\nDespite the challenge of redesigning how companies are set up, Ashraf said it's encouraging that many C-suite leaders recognize the need to help their workers build the skills needed to prepare for the changes stemming from companies' decisions to prioritize AI.\n\nAI might still have limitations, but its rapid pace of improvement means workers themselves also need to prioritize staying current. Otherwise, they risk falling behind, Alex Salazar, cofounder and CEO of the AI infrastructure startup Arcade, told Business Insider.\n\nA year ago, the coding agents that the company's software engineers now use couldn't do any of what they can do today, he said.\n\n\"What does that mean for your job as an engineer?\" Salazar said. \"It's got to evolve.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

This includes employees working on solutions teams, sales, corporate development, and others. \n\nSchindler said America's large customer sales teams and other customer-facing roles would not be eligible for the programs.\n\n\"While all GBO functions are essential to our long-term strategy, we've decided not to offer VEP for these particular roles to limit as much disruption to our customers as possible,\" he wrote.\n\nGoogle has made similar offers to employees in other orgs over the past year. Last June, Google offered buyouts to some US-based employees as it cracked down on its return-to-office mandate. In October, it offered buyouts to YouTube employees as part of a reorganization.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "What are the odds Google will still be around in 2126? According to investors bidding on a rare 100-year bond from the tech titan this week, they're pretty strong.\n\nAlphabet is offering a 100-year bond as part of its latest borrowing bonanza to finance its massive AI spending. The firm is seeking tens of billions of dollars for its projects via debt issuance in a range of currencies.\n\nIt has already raised $20 billion from US investors this week in a heavily oversubscribed offering, and is seeking at least $7.5 billion denominated in UK sterling and $3.6 billion in Swiss francs.\n\nAlphabet is expected to spend at least $175 billion on its AI buildout in 2026. That's second only to Amazon's $200 billion among mega-cap hyperscalers. Equity investors have largely encouraged the Google parent's capex plans. The stock is up 68% in the last year.\n\nNow, bond investors are casting their own vote of confidence.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the century bonds, as well as the bonds with shorter maturities, drew strong demand. The £1 billion slice of the deal attracted £9.5 billion worth of bids. Its dollar bond offering in the US on Monday drew record demand from investors, Bloomberg said.\n\nAlphabet's borrowing spree is the latest big debt raise by a mega-cap tech company, with Meta Platforms and Amazon also recently completing their own bond sales. The move comes as investors and commentators have expressed some concern that debt financing for AI could be a risk if the market wobbles and investor appetite wanes.\n\nYet, if demand for Alphabet's bonds is any indication, there's no sign yet that investors are shying away from lending to the top tech firms pursuing AI.\n\nCentury bonds are rare in the corporate debt world. Issuance of debt at such a long maturity is seen in sovereign bond markets. Ford issued a hundred-year bond in 2021, but the market hasn't seen such an issuance from a tech firm since the 1990s, when companies like Motorola and IBM were selling them.\n\nAlphabet's bonds are highly rated by credit rating agencies, stamped Aa2 by Moody's and AA+ by S&P Global.",

    "description": "You can ask Google to remove government ID numbers from Search.",
    "fullText": "Google announced two new ways for users to remove their sensitive information from the web Tuesday morning—or, at least, remove that data from Google Search. The first lets users request that Google remove sensitive government ID information from Search, while the second gives users new tools to request the same for non-consensual explicit images.\n\nFirst, Google is updating its existing \"Results about you\" tool, which helps users scour the internet for their personal information. Before today, this tool could already locate data points like your name, phone number, email addresses, and home addresses. Following the update, you can now find and request the deletion of search results containing highly sensitive information, including your driver's license, passport, or Social Security number.\n\nTo launch this tool, click here. If you've never used \"Results about you\" before, you'll need to set it up to tell Google what to look out for. Once you do, you'll be able to add government ID numbers, such as your driver's license, passport, and Social Security number. If Google finds a match, the company will let you know. You can receive an alert from the Google app on your smartphone, which takes you to a summary of what data was found and where. From here, you can choose from \"Request to remove,\" or \"Mark as reviewed.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this tool won't remove the data from the websites that are hosting it, but it will eventually remove the search results—sharply reducing the chance that someone will find your data on their own.\n\nGoogle says these changes will roll out in the U.S. over the \"coming days,\" while it is working on bringing them to other countries in the future.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Google is now rolling out a simpler tool for users to request the remove of non-consensual explicit images (NCEI) from Search. If you find such an image on Search, you can tap the three dots on that image, choose \"remove result,\" then \"it shows a sexual image of me.\" You'll have the choice to report whether the photo is real, or is artificially generated, as well, and you can report multiple images at once, if needed. Your requests will all appear in the Results about you hub, so you can track the progress of each.\n\nThe tool lets you opt-in to an option that will filter additional explicit results in other searches. Google says it will also share links to \"emotional and legal support\" after you submit a request.",

    "fullText": "Critics brand deal with regulator as ‘lightweight’ with ‘no legal bite’ as tech giants avoid legally binding measures\n\nApple and Google have committed to avoid discriminating against apps that compete with their own products under an agreement with the UK’s competition watchdog, as they avoided legally binding measures for their mobile platforms.\n\nThe US tech companies have vowed to be more transparent about vetting third-party apps before letting them on their app stores and not discriminate against third-party apps in app search rankings.\n\nThey have also agreed not to use data from third-party apps unfairly, such as using information about app updates to tweak their own offerings.\n\nApple has also committed to giving app developers an easier means of requesting use of its features such as the digital wallet, and live translation for AirPod users.\n\nThe commitments have been secured as part of a new regulatory regime overseen by the Competition and Markets Authority, (CMA), which has the power to impose changes on how Apple and Google operate their mobile platforms after deciding last year that they had “substantial, entrenched” market power.\n\nHowever, the CMA has opted to allow voluntary commitments rather than impose formal changes.\n\nTom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director who represents app developers challenging Apple and Google’s dominance of the mobile platform market, said the changes were “lightweight” and had no legal bite.\n\nThe CMA did not name specific Google and Apple apps that compete with third-party rivals but both firms offer their own music services in the form of YouTube Music and Apple Music. Google and Apple’s app stores are vital shopfronts for app developers because the Android and iOS platforms are used by the overwhelming majority of UK mobile phone users.\n\nHowever, the commitments do not cover a significant bugbear for app developers – the fees of up to 30% that Apple and Google charge developers to sell products via their app stores. The CMA is still considering whether to tackle how Apple and Google charge developers.\n\nThe CMA said if the companies fail to implement the commitments effectively they will impose them formally under new enforcement powers against tech companies. The commitments take effect on 1 April.\n\nSarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, said: “The ability to secure immediate commitments from Apple and Google reflects the unique flexibility of the UK digital markets competition regime and offers a practical route to swiftly address the concerns we’ve identified.”\n\nUnder the commitments, Apple and Google must provide data to the regulator showing the number of apps submitted for review and whether they were approved or rejected, plus the time taken to review those apps as well as the number of complaints received about the app stores and the outcomes of those processes.\n\nThe CMA will also monitor the outcome of applications to use the features and functionality within Apple’s mobile operating systems, such as the digital wallet.\n\nSmith said: “This first batch is so lightweight that it barely exists, and the promises made by Google and Apple are not legally binding in any case.\n\n“The main measures that could help with cost of living and economic growth issues may come later this year, such as forcing Apple to allow alternative app stores on its devices and to allow customers to avoid paying Apple’s commission.”\n\nThe News Media Association, whose members include the Guardian, questioned whether the commitments were “really worth the paper they are printed on”.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said the company faced “fierce competition” in every market it operates in. “The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers. We appreciate the positive and ongoing dialogue with UK officials.” they said.\n\nA Google spokesperson said its mobile ecosystem, including its Google Play app store, was a “driver of growth” in the UK economy. “While we believe Play’s existing developer practices are fair, objective, and transparent, we welcome the opportunity to resolve the CMA’s concerns collaboratively,” they said.",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "The company has become so powerful that its ability to borrow is beginning to rival, or even surpass, the US government.",
    "fullText": "This morning, I woke up to a stunning report that Google is gearing up to sell a 100-year bond.\n\nThat follows a similar move in early November, when Google issued a 50-year bond.\n\nInvestors are giving this company billions and are willing to wait up to a century to get it back. In contrast, the US government usually borrows money for a maximum of 30 years.\n\nAnd the interest rates Google is paying are not that much more than what the US Treasury pays. For the 50-year bond, Google paid about 1 percentage point more, but got an extra 20 years to repay.\n\nTo me, this means Google is now considered about as safe a bet as an entity that oversees the world's largest economy, operates the most powerful military on earth, and can print US dollars to pay back what it owes. How is this possible?\n\nIn September, something happened that changed what Google really is. After previously ruling Google was a monopoly, a federal judge delivered remedies that left the company mostly unscathed. In the words of former DOJ antitrust attorney John Newman, \"a judge just decided to let Google keep breaking the law.\"\n\nGoogle essentially became a government-approved monopoly. Other companies in similar situations, such as utilities, have their prices controlled by regulators. In contrast, Google gets to charge whatever it can get away with for online search ads.\n\nThe result is a profit gusher the likes of which the world has never seen. Net income topped $132 billion in 2025, Google reported last week. For 2026, the company plans to spend as much as $185 billion on data centers, chips, and other components to support its AI efforts.\n\nWhen you make and spend this much money, and have this much power — and regulators let it happen — then comparisons with a nation like the US become possible.\n\nWill Google be around in 2075 or 2126 to pay this money back? Right now, it has about as much chance as America to still be thriving in 50 or 100 years.\n\nThis particular 100-year bond is being issued in British pounds, according to the Financial Times. The only other entities to have borrowed for this long in this market are the University of Oxford, the Wellcome Trust, and EDF, the FT noted.\n\nMaking my point: EDF is a utility owned by the French government.\n\nA Google spokesperson said my argument was \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\"Not even the DOJ argued that Google should be regulated like a utility or that a private company should be turned into a regulated entity with capped pricing,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nGoogle is appealing the judge's monopoly ruling, which \"ignores an intensely competitive market where consumers have more ways than ever to find information online,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider. \"We're also asking that the implementation of specific remedies be paused as the appeal progresses.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.\n\nNote: Business Insider sued Google last year, alleging it monopolizes the digital ad market. Google called the suit \"meritless.\"",

    "description": "A Google executive explains why he taught his kids to understand AI — and how they ended up vibe coding and participating in a hackathon.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.\n\nKids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "title": "Ex-Google X leader thinks AI is about to expose a fatal flaw in capitalism",
    "description": "Mo Gawdat warns AI could disrupt capitalism, as automation replaces human labor, urging a rethink of economic systems for future stability.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence is colliding with capitalism in a way the system can't absorb. That's what Mo Gawdat told Business Insider's Reem Makhoul over an interview in September.\n\nAfter decades working inside Big Tech, including senior leadership roles at Microsoft and Google X, Gawdat has come to believe that the economic model underpinning modern capitalism breaks once machines replace most of the human workforce.\n\n\"The very base of capitalism, which is labor arbitrage — to hire you for a dollar and then sell what you make for two — is going to disappear,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nIn Gawdat's view, AI isn't just automating tasks. It's removing the need for human labor and, eventually, human decision-making at scale.\n\nWhen that happens, wages, jobs, and consumption — the pillars that keep capitalism running — start to fall apart, he said. However, while we may be in for a rocky ride ahead, the ultimate destination is one worth aiming for.\n\nCapitalism, Gawdat argues, is built on a simple idea: pay people less than the value of what they produce, sell the output for more, and keep the difference. That model depends on human labor.\n\nAs machines take on more work, the cost of making things keeps falling. AI pushes production closer and closer to zero cost, Gawdat says.\n\nWhen that happens, familiar ideas about pricing, profit, and scarcity stop working the way they always have.\n\nYou can't run an economy on productivity alone, he added. If people don't earn wages, they can't buy things. And without buyers, the system stalls.\n\nGawdat is blunt about what he thinks comes next.\n\nHe expects large waves of job losses across blue- and white-collar work. Lawyers, analysts, writers, executives — all of them, he said, are exposed.\n\n\"Your life and mine will witness times where there will be 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment in certain sectors,\" he said.\n\nHe's especially skeptical of tech leaders who frame AI-driven layoffs as efficiency wins. In the long run, he said, AI systems will come for them, too.\n\n\"Those CEOs forget that sooner or later the AI will replace them too,\" he said, adding, \"AI is better than humans at every task, including being a CEO.\"\n\nWhat will happen when the capitalist system built around jobs suddenly has far fewer of them?\n\nWithout some form of guaranteed income, consumption collapses. And when consumption collapses, capitalism can't function. Governments will be forced to rethink how money flows through society.\n\n\"Without consumption, there is no economy,\" he said, adding, \"So they're going to have to give people some kind of income to keep going.\"\n\nHe thinks different regions will handle this transition differently. Western economies, which place heavy value on productivity and individual output, may struggle the most.\n\nDespite the warnings, Gawdat doesn't see AI itself as dangerous.\n\nHe describes intelligence as neutral — powerful, but directionless on its own. The real risk, he said, is what happens during the transition, when AI systems are highly capable but still answering to human incentives built around greed, competition, and power.\n\n\"The challenge that humanity faces today is not the rise of AI, it's the rise of AI in an age where humanity is at its lowest morality,\" he said.\n\nOver time, Gawdat believes machines will make more rational decisions than today's political and corporate leaders. That shift, he argues, could ultimately produce a fairer system than the one we have now.\n\nCapitalism, in his view, won't survive in its current form. But that doesn't mean the future has to be bleak.\n\n\"It's an invitation to change,\" he said. \"And if you change, you would create not only an opportunity to survive, but an opportunity to thrive.\"",

    "fullText": "Big Tech is taking the AI age to a whole new level.\n\nWhen Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta announced earnings recently, one set of numbers stole the show: The massive projections for data center spending this year.\n\nThough the industry's capital expenditures — spending on property and equipment — have ramped up in recent years, 2026 is shaping up to be leaps and bounds ahead of any private-sector infrastructure spending in modern history.\n\nThe projections draw comparisons to previous transformational eras, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the Information Age of the 1990s.\n\nStill, Wall Street questions whether it will bring a return on investment — and investors are starting to get antsy. Shares of Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta were all down as of Friday morning. Microsoft was slightly up.\n\n\"Investors needed more than promises to underwrite this story,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote Thursday in a research note following Amazon's earnings call.\n\nAmazon said Thursday it is planning $200 billion in capital expenditures this year, a more than 50% increase from 2025 and the largest estimated budget among Big Tech companies.\n\nThe forecast came in $50 billion above analysts' expectations, and they were less than impressed — despite Amazon's 14% revenue growth for the quarter compared with the same period last year.\n\nThe company's stock dropped as much as 10% after the bell on Thursday, and was down 8% on Friday morning.\n\nWith spending this extreme, a beat on earnings should be \"table-stakes,\" Bernstein's Shmulik wrote Thursday night in a research note that dripped with sarcasm.\n\n\"If we're going to peg the share price to 2026 CapEx, maybe Amazon should have guided even higher, Shmulik wrote. \"Why not at this point?\"\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet stunned investors on Wednesday when it said it is planning $175 billion to $185 billion in capex for 2026, doubling its budget for the second year in a row.\n\nGoogle, which trails behind Amazon and Microsoft in cloud services, has dramatically increased its spending as demand for its Gemini AI models grows. Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users, the company said on its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\nGoogle's stock was down about 2% Friday morning as investors digested Big Tech's big spending plans for 2026.\n\nOne thing Google has going for it is the growing enthusiasm for Gemini.\n\n\"We believe these investments are rational, given its fast-growing backlog, supporting our view that Alphabet is among the best positioned to emerge as one of the leading, if not the leading, AI platform,\" BNP Paribas analyst Nick Jones wrote Thursday in a research note.\n\nLike its Big Tech peers, Meta will up the ante on AI investment in 2026. It was the only company that seemed to get a pass from investors this earnings season — at first, that is.\n\nMeta said last week it is planning $115 billion to $135 billion in capex, close to doubling its spend from last year. Meta's stock surged 8% on January 29, the morning after its fourth-quarter earnings call. Investors were pleased with the social media giant's strong advertising business, which reported $58.14 billion in ad revenue that quarter. What's more, it saw gains from its advertising AI tools.\n\nSince then, enthusiasm has waned, and the stock has been on a downward slope this week.\n\nMicrosoft reported $37.5 billion in capex for the second quarter of its fiscal 2026. While the company hasn't released full-year capex guidance, S&P last week estimated the figure could be around $97.7 billion, with some analysts projecting slightly more.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business heavily depends on OpenAI. The ChatGPT-maker represents 45% of its backlog, meaning Microsoft's future cloud revenue largely depends on it. The company's stock fell 12% on January 29, the morning after it reported earnings last week — Microsoft's biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nInvestors seemed pleased with the 17% jump in total revenue, including a 39% spike in revenue from Azure and other cloud services.",

    "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that even he has \"fallen prey\" to \"the pixie dust\" of seeing Apple or Google on a résumé.",
    "fullText": "Even Elon Musk sometimes hires the wrong people.\n\n\"I've fallen prey to the pixie dust thing as well, where it's like, 'Oh, we'll hire someone from Google or Apple, and they'll be immediately successful,'\" Musk told Stripe cofounder John Collison and tech Dwarkesh Patel during a 3-hour-long appearance on a special joint episode of their podcasts.\n\nIt's why Tesla's CEO doesn't put his full faith in a candidate's résumé.\n\n\"Generally, what I tell people—I tell myself, I guess, aspirationally—is, don't look at the résumé. Just believe your interaction. The résumé may seem very impressive, and it's like, 'Wow, the résumé looks good.' But if the conversation after 20 minutes is not \"Wow,\" you should believe the conversation, not the paper,\" he said.\n\nHe said he's made other mistakes, too. \"My batting average is still not perfect, but it's very high,\" he said. That includes the times he's discounted certain personality traits.\n\n\"I think it's a good idea to hire for talent and drive and trustworthiness,\" he said. \"And I think goodness of heart is important. I underweighted that at one point. So, are they a good person? Trustworthy? Smart and talented and hard working? If so, you can add domain knowledge.\"\n\nMusk said that it takes a lot to truly impress him.\n\n\"The things I ask for are bullet points for evidence of exceptional ability.\"\n\nThe examples \"can be pretty off the wall,\" but he's looking for evidence of something truly great.\n\n\"If somebody can cite even one thing, but let's say three things, where you go, 'Wow, wow, wow,' then that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\nWhen companies like Tesla are successful, Musk said, their competitors take notice and do everything they can to poach top talent.\n\n\"Tesla had a further challenge where when Tesla had very successful periods, we would be relentlessly recruited from,\" he said. \"Like, relentlessly.\"\n\nMusk said when Apple had its own electric car program, recruiters for the tech giant were \"carpet bombing\" Tesla employees to the point that some engineers just unplugged their phones. (In 2024, Apple reportedly abandoned its secretive car program.)\n\n\"Their opening offer without any interview would be like double the compensation at Tesla. So we had a bit of the 'Tesla pixie dust' thing where it's like, 'Oh, if you hire a Tesla executive, suddenly everything's going to be successful,'\" he said.\n\nSome former employees have complained about Musk's management style. During the interview, the Tesla CEO joked about his reputation as a micro manager, insisting that it be called \"Nano management, please.\" Musk said that, in reality, he now doesn't have enough time to oversee every aspect of his sprawling empire.\n\nUltimately, though, Musk said he just wants one thing.\n\n\"If somebody gets things done, I love them, and if they don't, I hate them,\" he said. \"So it's pretty straightforward. It's not like some idiosyncratic thing.\"",

    "title": "Car Icons Are Disappearing From Google Maps in Android Auto (but You Might Be Able to Fix It)",
    "description": "How to fix disappearing car icons when using Google Maps with Android Auto.",
    "fullText": "Android Auto users are reporting a bug that is making their cars disappear from the road—ok, not literally, but within Google Maps. On both Reddit and Google's own support forums, drivers now say their car icons are sporadically disappearing from their navigation screens while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. Some users have discovered workarounds, but the fixes don't appear to be consistent for everyone. Here's what's happening, and what you can do to try to fix it.\n\nThe news first started popping up six days ago, on a Reddit thread where multiple users reported problems with their car icons disappearing while using the Google Maps app through Android Auto. According to these drivers, when the bug was triggered, the map would move around normally, and traffic data and navigation instructions continued to display as expected. However, the icon indicating their car's position would suddenly disappear from their screen, making it difficult to know where exactly they were in comparison to the road. That's not ideal if you're trying to judge when your next turn is coming up.\n\nAccording to the thread's original poster, the issue popped up for them on the Android Auto version 16.1 release, although others mentioned the issue occurring as far back as version 15.9. The bug doesn't appear to happen all the time, but \"reliably\" appears when leaving Google Maps, opening another app in fullscreen, and either returning to Google Maps in fullscreen or pulling it up alongside the new app in a splitscreen view. To get their icon back, the original poster had to force quit Google Maps on their phone, but this wouldn't stop the bug from occurring again in the future. Google itself has not yet offered public comment on the issue, although I've reached out to the company and will update this post when I hear back.\n\nIf you're encountering a disappearing car icon while using Google Maps through Android Auto, there are a few fixes that have worked for community members, although whether they'll work for everyone appears to be inconsistent.\n\nThe timing of this bug appears to line up with the Android Auto v16.1 release, which launched last week. While the bug has been reported appearing on older versions of the app, like Android Auto v15.9, it could be worth trying out another version of Android Auto to see if it clears up the issue. For instance, one user mentioned that installing Android Auto V16.0.66 fixed the issue for them. If you're on an older version, you can update to a newest one from the Android Auto listing on the Play Store. If you're on a newest version and want to try an older one, though, you'll need to uninstall your Android Auto app and manually sideload the older version using a trusted APK file. Because these can be tricky to verify, this might not be the best option for most people.\n\nMultiple users in the original Reddit thread, including the original poster, pointed out that the bug only seems to affect them when using a non-default car icon. Until Google issues a fix, one solution might be to change your car icon back to the standard white arrow within a blue circle. To change your car icon in Google Maps, open the app on your phone while not connected to Android Auto. Start navigating to a location. Tap on your car icon, and swipe left or right to adjust the icon until you land on the default white arrow within a blue circle. The next time you connect your Google Maps app to Android Auto, your car's icon should be updated. Note that this isn't a guaranteed fix. One user on a Google support forum, for instance, said that their arrow icon also disappeared from Google Maps in Android Auto when returning from another app.\n\nIf there is one saving grace to this bug, it's that the circumstances for triggering it seem to be pretty consistent. That means you can largely avoid it if you simply don't leave the Google Maps app once you open it. But while that might be OK for short trips, it's not ideal for longer ones, where you might want to adjust a podcast or playlist during your drive. You can manually restart your Google Maps app on your phone every time the bug pops up, but not only is that annoying, it's possibly dangerous if you're in the middle of a drive.\n\nIf none of the above fixes work for you and you want to retain the ability to exit your fullscreen navigation app without losing your car icon, it might be worth putting Google Maps to bed for now and using an alternative navigation app. Google's own Waze app, for instance, works with Android Auto and does not seem to have this bug right now. Alternative navigation apps do have their own pros and cons, as Waze focuses less on comprehensive mapping and more on real-time crowdsourced traffic information when determining routes. However, it might be worth a shot. If Waze doesn't work for you, other popular navigation apps compatible with Android Auto include Sygic GPS and TomTom - Maps & Traffic (formerly TomTom AmiGo).",

Includes dynamically installable skillsets for Google \nservices, shell execution, file management, and task scheduling.\n\nThe Moltbot blueprint is a comprehensive personal AI automation agent that\nbrings the power of Moltbot/Clawdbot to the ChatBotKit platform. Unlike\nself-hosted alternatives that require managing infrastructure and security,\nthis blueprint provides all the automation capabilities in a secure, managed\nenvironment with enterprise-grade isolation.\n\nThe agent is accessible across four communication channels—Slack for work\nconversations, Telegram for secure personal messaging, WhatsApp for mobile\naccessibility, and Email for asynchronous communication. Users can interact\nwith their personal automation agent wherever they are, and conversations\nmaintain context across channels.\n\nAt the heart of this blueprint is a minimal-footprint main agent with just\ncore capabilities: skillset discovery, skillset installation, shell execution,\nand file management. Rather than loading all abilities upfront, the agent\ndiscovers available skillsets at runtime and installs only what's needed.\nThis pattern keeps the agent fast and focused while enabling unlimited\nexpansion.\n\nProactive Automation with Triggers\n\nFive scheduled triggers automate common workflows:\n\nAll shell commands run in isolated sandbox containers that are created\non-demand and destroyed after use. The agent has its own persistent Space\nfor storing scripts, automation outputs, and configuration files. Unlike\nself-hosted Moltbot which has full system access, this architecture\nensures even malicious code cannot escape the sandbox.\n\nGoogle services use personal OAuth secrets, meaning each user authenticates\nwith their own Google account. The agent never sees raw credentials—it\nreceives scoped access tokens that can only perform the permitted actions.\nThis provides true personal automation where your calendar, email, and\nfiles remain under your control.\n\nThis blueprint demonstrates advanced ChatBotKit patterns: multi-channel\ndeployment, dynamic skillset installation, personal OAuth, scheduled\ntriggers for proactive automation, and secure shell execution—all\ncombined into a practical personal automation assistant.\n\nCommon information about the bot's experience, skills and personality. \n\nThis example uses a dedicated Skillset. Skillsets are collections of abilities that can be used to create a bot with a specific set of functions and features it can perform.\n\nThis example uses Secrets to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.\n\nThis blueprint can be deployed using Terraform, enabling infrastructure-as-code management of your ChatBotKit resources. Use the code below to recreate this example in your own environment.\n\nCopy this Terraform configuration to deploy the blueprint resources:\n\nLearn more about the Terraform provider\n\nA dedicated team of experts is available to help you create your perfect chatbot.

    "fullText": "Compact and comfortable Pixel Buds have noise cancelling, decent battery life and good everyday sound\n\nGoogle’s latest budget Pixel earbuds are smaller, lighter, more comfortable and have noise cancelling, plus a case that allows you to replace the battery at home.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a uses the design of the excellent Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few high-end features at a more palatable £109 (€129/$129/A$239) price, undercutting rivals in the process.\n\nThat makes the Buds 2a some of the smallest and most comfortable earbuds on the market, with a disc the size of a Smartie chocolate protruding from your ear canal and no stalk to get in the way of earrings.\n\nEach earbud has a small silicone stabiliser that rests against the inside of your ear opposite the tip to securely hold them in place without putting undue pressure on any soft tissue. That makes them super comfortable for long periods of listening time without feeling as if they’re going to fall out, even during vigorous movement.\n\nThe disk is touch-sensitive for tap controls for playback, noise cancelling and accessing Gemini. They work well but they lack the excellent swipe gesture for volume control from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which is a shame.\n\nThe battery lasts a solid seven or so hours with noise cancelling while the compact flip-top case recharges the buds about 1.8 times for a total of 20 hours playback. The case is great, but the white picks up marks easily, including staining from jeans and other clothing.\n\nWater resistance: IP54 (splash resistant)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.4 (SBC, AAC)\n\nBattery life: 7h with ANC (20h with case)\n\nEarbud dimensions: 23.1 x 16 x 17.8mm\n\nCharging case dimensions: 50 x 57.2 x 24.5mm\n\nThe Buds 2a have the same Google Tensor A1 chip as their Pro siblings, which ensures rock-solid connectivity with any standard Bluetooth device, including Android phones, iPhones, tablets, consoles and computers. The Pixel Buds app on Android adjusts settings and controls, but Google’s web app can do similar on a Mac, Windows PC or Chromebook in the browser.\n\nThey can connect to two devices at once and support the standard SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats. Call quality is reasonable if a bit quiet, meaning you have to talk up in silent spaces, and they let through background noise on busy streets but not enough to drown out my voice.\n\nThe earbuds can also be used to talk to Gemini Live on a compatible phone, including reading out notifications and other features.\n\nGoogle does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The batteries in the earbuds are not replaceable but the battery in the case can be replaced with standard tools. Repair specialists iFixit awarded the earbuds four out of 10 for repairability.\n\nThe Buds 2a are made with at least 41% recycled materials including cobalt, plastic, rare-earth elements and tin. Google breaks down the earbuds’ environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.\n\nThe sound quality is very good for a set of everyday earbuds. They do a good job with most genres, with solid separation of tones, plenty of bass where needed and relatively detailed mids and highs. They sound great with rock, pop and electronica, but lack a bit of nuance in classical tracks.\n\nThe Buds 2a also support spatial audio with compatible phones, but not head-tracking, which is a feature reserved for their more expensive siblings. It works well with film and TV shows with a Pixel phone.\n\nThe new buds are the first in Google’s A-series to have active noise cancelling. It is not quite as effective as that in the Buds Pro 2, but does a very good job for the money. It reduces road roar and engine noise, street sounds and background hubbub, but struggles to keep out higher tones such as the clicks of keyboards or chatter in the office.\n\nThe cheaper buds also lack adaptive sound and the ability to automatically dampen loud noise when using the ambient sound mode, but I don’t think they are crucial features.\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds 2a cost £109 (€129/$129/A$239).\n\nFor comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost £169, the Nothing Ear 3 cost £149, the Fairphone Fairbuds cost £66.75, the Apple AirPods 4 cost from £119 and the AirPods Pro 3 cost £219.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a are a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for more than just Android at a good price.\n\nTheir compact form and shape make them very comfortable and discreet, lacking the stalks that are popular with rivals. The battery life is solid, the case nice and compact, and they work well, connecting to two devices at once.\n\nThey sound great for everyday earbuds and the noise cancelling is good for the money. They lack a few bells and whistles including onboard volume control, adaptive audio and wireless charging, plus their call quality is only average.\n\nOne of the best upgrades is an easily replaceable battery in the case, which is progress towards better sustainability. But the batteries in the earbuds remain irreplaceable, ultimately making them disposable.\n\nPros: compact, comfortable, seven-hour battery, great case, good sound and noise cancelling, multipoint Bluetooth, case with replaceable battery, web app for use with computers.\n\nCons: earbuds unrepairable, no volume control gesture, no support for higher quality Bluetooth formats, average call quality, no adaptive audio or loud noise protection for transparency",

    "fullText": "Alphabet reports $34.5bn profit and revenue soars 48% in recent quarter as it plans a sharp increase in AI spending\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, and is planning a sharp increase in capital spending in 2026 as it continues to invest deeply in AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet on Wednesday reported profit of $34.5bn in the recently ended quarter, as revenue from cloud computing soared 48%.\n\nThe company also forecast spending between $175bn and $185bn this year, a figure much higher than analysts’ expectations of roughly $115bn.\n\nIn an earnings call, investors pressed Alphabet’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, on the significant increase. “We’ve been supply constrained, even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.\n\nAlphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own data centers “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered tool known as a “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.\n\n“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board, Pichai said.\n\nAlphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.\n\nThe company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.\n\nThe report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.\n\nThe newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that has prompted panic at competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stock jumped 3% when Google debuted the model.\n\nThen in January, Google and Apple announced the company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously faced criticism for not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuation shot up to $4tn after the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.\n\nAnalysts viewed the multi-year agreement as a huge win for Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of 2.5bn active devices.\n\n“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.\n\nLike larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.\n\nBut investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.\n\nAs the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.\n\nThe driverless car division Waymo is working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that its Chrome browser will adapt more Gemini AI features, too.\n\nGoogle is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built an illegal monopoly over online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed only modest limits on the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "fullText": "Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.\n\nThe stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nWall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:\n\nAlphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026.\n\nThe company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"\n\nThe company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.\n\nAdvertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.\n\nAshkenazi said \"advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.\n\nThat business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.\n\n\"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient,\" Pichai said. \"We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements.\"\n\nOther Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.\n\nWaymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.\n\nThe self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.\n\nWATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobs",

    "description": "Alphabet's Q4 results beat estimates. Google plans to double capex in 2026, while search and cloud remained strong.",
    "fullText": "Google just reported another blockbuster quarter, with its fourth-quarter revenue soaring past Wall Street expectations,\n\nThat said, you might not think it to look at the stock, which took a dip after Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, predicting it will spend between $175 billion and $185 billion — far beyond analysts' prior expectations.\n\nSome upbeat numbers softened the blow, with Google's search advertising and cloud business running hot. Google announced its annual revenue had exceeded $400 billion for the first time, while quarterly revenue hit $113.8 billion, above estimates of $111 billion. Google Cloud became a particularly bright spot, with revenues up 48% year over year.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Alphabet's earnings call.\n\nLet's get the big one out of the way. Google said on Wednesday that it expects capital expenditures of between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026. That's the money going to data centers, chips, construction materials, and other components needed to build out and support Google's AI efforts.\n\nIt's a huge figure. Google previously warned that its capex spend would be higher than last year's, when it spent just over $90 billion. Its updated guidance for 2026 surpassed street expectations and sent the stock tumbling 2% after its otherwise very healthy earnings report.\n\nGoogle's capex estimate is even higher than Meta's, which last week said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion for 2026, nearly doubling its spend from last year.\n\nGoogle said its Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. That's 100 million more than it had in October last year.\n\n\"We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the call on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the graph trends in the right direction, it also suggests a slowdown, as Google said in October that it had gained 200 million extra users over Q3, aided by the rollout of its viral Nano Banana image generator.\n\nGoogle said on Wednesday that it now has over 325 million paid subscriptions across its consumer services, with Google One and YouTube Premium the most popular.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, Netflix announced last month it had also hit 325 million subscribers. It's not a total like-for-like comparison — Netflix doesn't have a cloud storage product, for one. Still, with YouTube clearly taking a big chunk of those users, it should be enough to alarm Netflix's leaders.\n\nGoogle likes to talk up its full-stack AI advantage. By owning everything from AI models to cloud servers and chips, Google gains more control over the technology and how it all fits together.\n\nOn Wednesday's call, Pichai flagged that Google was seeing significant benefits from this, lowering Gemini's serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 \"through model optimizations, efficiency, and utilization improvements.\"\n\nSoftware stocks took a hammering this week after Anthropic rolled out new features that could perform clerical and administrative tasks for people in the legal industry.\n\nCould this be another \"DeepSeek moment,\" as Evercore senior managing director Mark Mahaney suggested on the call? Pichai suggested the scramble this week might be overblown.\n\n\"I think it is an enabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services, be it Search, YouTube, etc,\" Pichai said of Gemini, saying that companies that are \"seizing the moment\" will \"have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHave something to share?

BI's Hugh Langley, our resident Google expert, breaks down what you need to look out for in the numbers and on the call.\n\nGoogle has been on a three-month tear since its last check-in, launching Gemini 3 to much fanfare and joining the $4 trillion market-cap club. The string of successes put it at the front of the highly competitive AI race.\n\n(A quick aside on these arbitrary rankings. You could argue Nvidia's the biggest winner of the AI race, but it's really in its own bucket. I'm talking about companies with competing chatbots. No further questions at this time.)\n\nBut here's the thing about the AI race. It's highly volatile. One quarter, you're the belle of the ball; the next, you can't even get your texts returned. Just ask Meta and Microsoft.\n\nInvestors are expecting a big swing one way or another. Google's implied one-day share move following earnings is 4.9%, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nYou don't have to search too far to find the key to Google's earnings.\n\nGoogle Search (get it) and the ad business built around it are still the company's crown jewel. It's also an area many have speculated AI would upend. (Why \"Google it\" if you can \"ChatGPT it\"?)\n\nGoogle has managed to incorporate AI features without cannibalizing its cash cow. But it's a tricky balancing act, and Google is already blurring the line between Search and Gemini.\n\nThe real tipping point will be ads. Google executives have been adamant that there are no immediate plans to bring them to Gemini anytime soon. However, if Search's massive traffic ultimately gets passed to the chatbots, advertising's arrival feels inevitable.\n\nIt also might not have a choice.\n\nOpenAI is preparing to roll out ads to some ChatGPT users despite Sam Altman previously calling them a \"last resort.\" In such a highly competitive race, and with so much money on the line, giving your rivals any type of headstart is a risk.",

    "description": "Microsoft's security boss Charlie Bell is moving to a new role as an individual contributor.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft's security boss, Charlie Bell, is moving to a new role as an individual contributor, and the company hired Google executive Hayete Gallot to replace him, according to an internal memo from CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nGallot is a former Microsoft executive who joined Google in 2024 as president of customer experience for Google Cloud. Nadella called out Gallot's 15 years of experience at Microsoft in senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, and said Gallot was instrumental in the company's security business.\n\nBell, considered a key building of Amazon Web Services, joined Microsoft in 2021 to run a newly formed organization focused on cybersecurity. There was recent speculation inside Microsoft that Bell was preparing to retire. Bell's new role will be \"focused on engineering quality,\" according to the memo.\n\nMicrosoft has faced security challenges during Bell's tenure.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security in 2024, for example, condemned Microsoft for what it called \"a cascade of security failures\" that allowed Chinese hackers to access emails from thousands of customers.\n\nMicrosoft, that same year, expanded what the company calls its Secure Future Initiative, making security the top priority for every employee, including adding security as a metric on which employees are evaluated during performance reviews.\n\nBell was expected to be a candidate to replace Andy Jassy when he took over as Amazon CEO for founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Instead, Jassy chose Adam Selipsky, who was previously AWS's de facto chief operating officer until he left in 2016 to become CEO of Tableau. Selipsky stepped down from that role in 2024.\n\nI am excited to share a couple updates in two of our core priorities: security and quality. Hayete Gallot is rejoining Microsoft as Executive Vice President, Security, reporting to me. I've also asked Charlie Bell to take on a new role focused on engineering quality, reporting to me.\n\nCharlie and I have been planning this transition for some time, given his desire to move from being an org leader to being an IC engineer. And I love how energized he is to practice this craft here day in and day out!\n\nHayete joins us from Google where she was President, Customer Experience for Google Cloud. Before that, she spent more than 15 years at Microsoft with senior leadership roles across engineering and sales, playing multiple critical roles in building two of our biggest franchises — Windows and Office, leading our commercial solution areas go to market efforts. And she was instrumental in the design and implementation of our Security Solution Area. She brings an ethos that combines product building with value realization for customers, which is critical right now.\n\nAs we shared during our quarterly earnings last week, we have great momentum in security, including progress with Security Copilot agents, strong Purview adoption, and continued customer growth, and we will build on this.\n\nWe have a deep bench of talent and leaders across our security business, and this team will now report to Hayete. Additionally, Ales Holecek will take on a new role as Chief Architect for Security, reporting to Hayete. Ales has spent years leading architecture and development across some of our most important platforms and will help bring that same sensibility to security and its connections back to our existing scale businesses and the Agent Platform.\n\nAs we shared yesterday, we have a new operating rhythm with commercial cohorts, and Hayete and her team will now be accountable for our security product rhythms as part of this process.\n\nCharlie built our Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management organization and helped rally the company behind the Secure Future Initiative. And we're fortunate to have his continued focus and leadership on another one of our top priorities. With our Quality Excellence Initiative, we have increased accountability and accelerated progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we always deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. And Charlie will partner closely with Scott Guthrie and Mala Anand on this work.\n\nI'm excited to welcome Hayete back to Microsoft to advance this mission critical work, and grateful to Charlie for all he has done for our security business and what he will continue to do for the company.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Sustainable smartphone takes a step forward with modular accessories, a good screen and mid-range performance\n\nThe Dutch ethical smartphone brand Fairphone is back with its six-generation Android, aiming to make its repairable phone more modern, modular, affordable and desirable, with screw-in accessories and a user-replaceable battery.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 costs £499 (€599), making it cheaper than previous models and pitting it squarely against budget champs such as the Google Pixel 9a and the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while being repairable at home with long-term software support and a five-year warranty. On paper it sounds like the ideal phone to see out the decade.\n\nThe new Fairphone is slicker than its predecessors, with a modern, 6.3in 120Hz OLED screen on the front and a recycled plastic body that feels solid and high quality. It looks great in its off-white colour as tested, but also comes in green or black. The phone is resistant against rain and splashes but not immersion, so don’t drop it in a bath or swimming pool.\n\nThe back plate is held in place by two exposed Torx screws and hides the battery and other modular components, which can simply be unscrewed and replaced at home if needed.\n\nThe power button doubles as fingerprint scanner, but it is quite slim; and being flush with the side makes the task of pressing it harder than necessary. Unfortunately, the volume buttons are directly opposite the power button and precisely where you place your fingers for grip, which leads to frequent accidental presses that trigger either unwanted screenshots or the power-off and restart menu. They are also very easy to hit accidentally when pulling the phone out of a pocket, ramping up the volume unnecessarily.\n\nAbove the power button on the right side is a big, colourful switch that turns on Fairphone’s “Moments” minimalist interface, which blocks notifications and swaps the standard Android home screen for a simple list of essential apps. It’s a smart idea for those hoping to reduce distractions. But swiping up to exit an app shows the regular home screen for a split second, making it feel like a hack. The switch can be repurposed for other features, including activating “do not disturb” or the torch.\n\nScreen: 6.31in 120Hz FHD+ OLED (431ppi)\n\nProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3\n\nCamera: 50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, 32MP selfie\n\nConnectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6E, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4 and GNSS\n\nWater resistance: IP55 (splash/rain)\n\nDimensions: 156.5 x 73.3 x 9.6mm\n\nThe Fairphone 6 has the same mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip as the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which can’t rival the best phones for raw power but generally feels fast enough in use. It will handle light gaming and most tasks but will struggle with more advanced titles. The phone has 256GB of storage and a rare microSD card slot for adding more.\n\nThe battery life is reasonable if not remarkable, lasting about 35 hours between charges with the screen actively used for about four to five hours across 5G and wifi. The Fairphone should see out most heavy-use days, but will need charging nightly.\n\nThe battery will maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles and it can be replaced at home using a single screwdriver, along with the rest of the 12 modular components. Batteries cost £35, screens £78 and the main camera £61. The phone was awarded 10 out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit.\n\nThe handset is made with 50% recycled or fair materials, and Fairphone publishes its lifecycle report.\n\nThe phone either runs regular Android 15 with Google services, as reviewed, or a privacy-focused, open-source version of Android, without Google services, called /e/OS. Unfortunately, that means the Fairphone 6 isn’t running the latest version of Android 16, but it will be supported with updates until 2033, which is about a year longer than the best mainstream phones.\n\nThe software is generally uncluttered with little in the way of customisation, which for the most part is a good thing. But it is a little rough around the edges and lacks a few of the bells and whistles that Samsung, Google and others add to their software.\n\nIt is notably devoid of the artificial intelligence that has been shoved in every crevice by other phone manufacturers. It has Google’s Gemini chatbot assistant, but without the ability to activate it via voice while the phone is locked. The Fairphone also misses out on Google’s excellent Circle to Search feature common to most other phones, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nRecent updates have fixed some of the bugs, including one in which the screen stuttered and stalled after being turned on from standby. But the software still lacks the level of polish you should expect.\n\nThe Fairphone has two cameras on the back and one selfie camera in the screen. The main 50-megapixel camera shoots good photos in bright light, but it struggles with high contrast scenes, often misjudging the white balance or looking washed out. The night mode is usable but not as good as you’d expect from a modern smartphone.\n\nThe 2x digital zoom is reasonable but stretching to 10x causes the photos to become full of artefacts. The 13MP ultrawide camera produces pretty good photos in decent light, with solid detail in the middle of the frame even if they are a little soft at the edges. The macrophotography mode can produce great closeup images with a bit of practice, and the 32MP selfie camera takes good photos for the money.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 easily has the best camera the company has made and gets the job done, but it can’t hold a candle to similarly priced rivals.\n\nThe Fairphone Gen 6 costs £499 (€599).\n\nFor comparison, Google’s Pixel 9a costs £499, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro costs £449 and the Apple iPhone 16e costs £599.\n\nThe sixth-generation Fairphone takes the company further into the mainstream with a solid, mid-range Android with all the perks of a modular, repairable and more ethical design.\n\nIt trades a few premium features for a lower price than its predecessors, but still has a good screen, great looks and reasonable battery life. It even has a microSD card slot for adding more storage, which is incredibly rare in 2026.\n\nThe camera is serviceable, though far from the best you can get for the money. The software is basic Android 15, which is unfortunately not the latest version, a little rough around the edges and devoid of AI tricks other than Google’s Gemini chatbot. But Fairphone is slowly fixing bugs and will provide support until 2033. The distraction-free Moments mode switch is a good idea, too. The chip is fast enough now, but it isn’t the most powerful and may become pretty tired after eight years of use.\n\nThe fingerprint scanner is not the best and the power and volume button placement is an irritating design flaw. While few phones offer as repair-friendly a design, more mainstream devices offer almost as long software support as the Fairphone.\n\nThe Fairphone 6 is the best, least-compromised phone the company has made. But things have improved in the rest of the industry, with better access to repair and longer software support, making the Fairphone tough to recommend for everyone over mainstream devices.\n\nPros: modular accessory support, repairable-at-home design, software support to 2033, recycled and fair materials, microSD card slot, good screen, five-year warranty,\n\nCons: mid-range performance, fingerprint scanner and volume button placement annoying, average camera, cannot be submerged in water, no Android 16 yet and software is a little rough around the edges.",

    "fullText": "Google has been on a monumental tear as of late. Can it keep the good times rolling?\n\nWhen Alphabet reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, investors will focus on AI spending, cloud wins, and a big Apple deal.\n\nWith Meta projecting its capex for this year to nearly double that of 2025, how high will Google go? The company said in October that it expected capex for 2025 to land between $91 and $93 billion. Investors will track if it sticks to those goals. Google's finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, also said the company expected a \"significant\" increase in that number for 2026 and promised we'd hear more on Google's Q4 call this week.\n\nAs my colleague Joe Ciolli has observed this earnings season, investors are more willing to forgive big capital spending on AI as long as fundamentals remain chugging along.\n\nThat leads to the question of how Google's search advertising business, its core engine, is doing. Are OpenAI and other AI rivals chipping away at its dominance, or is Alphabet's money-printing machine whirring as proudly as ever?\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein appeared optimistic in a note this week, writing that they expect Google to have seen an increase in query volume in Q4.\n\n\"For Tinuiti's advertisers, Google's US paid click growth was the highest it has been since early 2021,\" Bernstein analysts wrote, referring to the US marketing agency.\n\nGoogle's cloud business has also become top billing, as it furiously competes with Amazon and Microsoft to build infrastructure and win crucial AI deals. In Q3, Google said the number of new cloud customers increased by about 34% year over year.\n\nBernstein analysts predicted big business for cloud off the back of AI sales, its big Anthropic deal, and the ramp-up of its AI chip business, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).\n\n\"We also note that the new deal between Anthropic and Google for 'tens of billions of dollars' worth of compute represents upside to Google Cloud growth, regardless of whether the money flows through Cloud deals or outright TPU sales,\" they wrote.\n\nSpeaking of deals, this marks the first earnings report since Google and Apple announced that the iPhone giant will use Google's Gemini AI models for its revamped Siri assistant.\n\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions there. How much does Google get out of the deal? Can Google use query data to train Gemini? Will Apple use Google's data centers and TPU chips?\n\nHopefully, we'll get a clearer picture of the inner workings of that deal on Wednesday's earnings call.",

    "description": "A senior software engineer at Google took 40 Coursera courses and got multiple grad degrees to shift from business to AI.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Max Buckley, a 38-year-old senior software engineer at Google, based in Zurich, Switzerland. His identity and employment has been verified by Business Insider. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a senior software engineer at Google in Zurich, where I've worked since 2013.\n\nMost people don't go from business to a more technical background, but my bachelor's degree was in business studies, and I joined Google out of undergrad as a financial analyst intern.\n\nOver several years, I pivoted from financial analysis to business analysis, then to trust and safety, and onto an engineering team in 2016. I joined several other software engineering teams, and then eventually joined Google Cloud AI, where I worked on one of the cloud AI products for a few years.\n\nThen I joined an internal LLM innovation team within Google's core infrastructure group, which we later turned into an LLM information retrieval applied research team, where I am today, leading the team.\n\nTo make multiple shifts like this, you need to upskill and explore other areas. Here's how I did it:\n\nAs soon as I joined Google, I decided my North Star was to become a data scientist. Initially, I had a lot of success broadening my skillset with online courses like Coursera, edX, or Stanford. I used them to explore finance, then statistics, then spent most of my time in the computer science and data science space.\n\nAll in all, I completed roughly 40 online open courses, most of them through Coursera.\n\nSome of the courses I took include:\n\nThe courses were spread out from 2013 to 2021, and I took them on evenings and weekends. I didn't have much time for video games, but I still made time to go to the gym, eat, sleep, and spend time with my girlfriend.\n\nI wasn't super structured in my approach to taking courses. I didn't say \"I must do five hours a day,\" or anything like that. I took them as I felt the need to do one or to learn more about a particular topic. I didn't burn out from it.\n\nThe most measurably impactful courses I completed were the first two Coursera courses: Data Analysis and Computing for Data Analysis. I did them right before I interviewed for my internship at Google and the interviewer happened to have done the same course, so we had this instant rapport.\n\nI also did more formal part-time study.\n\nI finished my Bachelor of Business Studies in 2013. Then at Google, I got a part-time postgraduate certificate in statistics, which took a year. Then I did a part-time master's degree in Business Analytics, which took two years. Then I pursued a part-time master's degree in software engineering, which took close to five years. Most recently, I did a diploma in Advanced Studies In Data Science, which took another two years.\n\nI did a bunch of summer school certificates, which is when you spend a week doing PhD-level courses.\n\nMy message to others who want to transition is don't be discouraged. When I first wanted to join Google, several hiring managers weren't interested because I didn't have a computer science undergraduate degree. Similarly, when I applied for a Master's in Business Analytics, I was initially declined because I didn't have a technical undergraduate degree and two semesters of programming experience, even though I was programming at Google. There were hurdles that I had to work around.\n\nI always wanted to study computer science, but my dad told me it's better to learn something different because I'll probably end up in it anyway. In hindsight, he was right.\n\nStudying computer science would have certainly expedited my career track, but I'm in a place where it's no longer a hindrance, and I'm familiar with a bunch of business theories, like Porter's Five Forces. They're not always useful, but every once in a while, it comes up in conversation.\n\nThe constant here is that my background includes continuous learning. When recruiters or hiring managers see my profile, they see that I'm not someone who gets complacent.\n\nDid you make a career pivot? We want to hear from you.

It could also bolster SpaceX’s data-center ambitions as Musk competes with rivals like Alphabet's Google, Meta, Amazon-backed Anthropic and OpenAI in the AI sector.\n\nWhat regulatory challenges could this merger face?\n\nWhat makes SpaceX's xAI acquisition record-breaking?\n\nHow will combining SpaceX and xAI benefit both companies?\n\nHow does this fit into Musk's broader business strategy?\n\nThe transaction values SpaceX at $1 trillion, and xAI at $250 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: ⁠scaling to make a sentient sun to ‌understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\" Musk said.\n\nThe purchase of xAI sets a new record for the world's largest M&A deal, a distinction held for ‍more than 25 years when Vodafone bought Germany’s Mannesmann in a hostile takeover valued at $203 billion in 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe combined company of SpaceX and xAI is expected to price shares at about $527 each, another person familiar with the matter said. ​SpaceX was already the world's most valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share ‌sale. XAI was last valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe merger comes as the space company plans a blockbuster public offering this year that could value it at over $1.5 trillion, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSpaceX, xAI and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe deal further consolidates Musk's far-flung business empire and fortunes into a tighter, mutually reinforcing ecosystem – what some investors and analysts informally call the \"Muskonomy\" – which already includes Tesla, ⁠brain-chip maker Neuralink and tunnel firm the Boring Company.\n\nThe world's richest man ​has a history of merging his ventures together. Musk folded social media ​platform X into xAI through a share swap last year, giving the AI startup access to the platform’s data and distribution. In 2016, he used Tesla's stock to buy his solar-energy company SolarCity.\n\nThe ‍agreement could draw scrutiny from regulators and ⁠investors over governance, valuation and conflicts of interest given Musk's overlapping leadership roles across multiple firms, as well as the potential movement of engineers, proprietary technology and contracts between entities.",

    "title": "Google Pushed Back the Deadline on Migrating Your Fitbit Account (Again)",
    "description": "If you've been dragging your heels, you have a little more time—but don't wait too long.",
    "fullText": "When Google acquired Fitbit in 2021, it announced that all users would eventually need to link their devices to a Google account to continue using Fitbit's features and services. Google initially set a deadline sometime in 2025 for the mandatory migration, then pushed it to February 2, 2026—a date that seemed final at the time. Now, Google has granted yet another extension.\n\nNow, if you're still using a legacy Fitbit account (an account from before 2021), Google has extended the deadline for migrating Fitbit accounts to Google accounts for the second time, giving users until May 19, 2026, to make the switch.\n\nFor those who've been procrastinating, the migration process itself is straightforward and should only take a few minutes. Google provides step-by-step instructions on the Fitbit support page that walk users through linking their existing Fitbit data to a Google account.\n\nTo move your Fitbit account to a Google Account:\n\nSign in to your Fitbit account.\n\nTap Settings and select Move account.\n\nFollow the on-screen instructions.\n\nDuring the migration, you can review and make changes to your Fitbit data and setup. After that, you can then manage your Fitbit data from your Google Account settings and the Fitbit app. And if you change your mind, you can cancel until the final step. Again, you have until May 19, 2026, to complete the transition.\n\nIt's worth noting that anyone who created a new Fitbit account or purchased a device in roughly the last two years is already using the Google-based system. The migration requirement only affects users with older, pre-acquisition accounts.\n\nFrom the start, this news didn't sit well with everyone, and it still doesn't sit well now. Many long-time Fitbit aren't exactly eager to tie their health data to Google's ecosystem.\n\nFor users who refuse to migrate, there's still an option to preserve or erase your data. Google has set July 15, 2026, as the final date to download or delete your Fitbit account and all associated health information. And if you're choosing to leave the platform entirely, keep in mind that deleting your data is the safest choice for privacy and security reasons.\n\nThere also seems to be general migration issues, like for young Fitbit users. Some parents have reported that Supervised Google accounts—designed for children and teenagers—cannot log into the Fitbit app, creating a roadblock for families who purchased devices for their kids.\n\nDespite the extensions and the complaints, the direction is clear: Google is moving forward with integrating Fitbit into its ecosystem. Whether you embrace the change or walk away from your tracker, the clock is ticking on making that decision.",

    "description": "Igor Tsvetkov says he faced a \"lot of stress\" as a senior staff engineer at Meta. But securing a demotion isn't easy, he said. Now, he's at Google.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?\n\nIgor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.\n\n\"I did not fit in perfectly,\" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. \"It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.\"\n\nHis slow ramp-up caused a \"lot of stress,\" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.\n\nOn \"The Peterman Pod,\" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.\n\n\"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,\" Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov needed to \"start from zero,\" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was \"generous\" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.\n\nHe also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.\n\nWhile Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTsvetkov eventually said he asked management: \"Can I actually drop a level?\"\n\nThat's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.\n\n\"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,\" he added. \"I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.\"\n\nA Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "description": "I followed a hackathon team as they raced to vibe code an app in seven hours at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.",
    "fullText": "Just after sunrise, four vibe coding enthusiasts from Malaysia crossed into Singapore with a loose idea — and a bet that AI could build most of their app.\n\nHours later, they were racing to prototype it at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThe four friends, all in their late 30s to 40s, came from different professional backgrounds. Chan Wei Khjan is an accountant. Chan Ler-Kuan lectures on AI at a private university. Loh Wah Kiang works in IT. Lee How Siem, who goes by Benny, is the chief technology officer of a Malaysian startup.\n\nTheir initial idea was a \"feng shui\" app to analyze properties in Singapore — a potentially lucrative use case in a market obsessed with housing and wealth accumulation. Feng shui is a traditional Chinese practice that evaluates how a person's surroundings, along with birth factors, influence luck and well-being.\n\nI embedded with the team at Google's developer space in Singapore in January to observe how a vibe-coding project comes together — or nearly falls apart — in seven hours.\n\nThe assignment: Teams of up to four people had to build a working demo, publish a public repository with code, and submit a short video explaining their project by 5:30 p.m.\n\nEach project had to fit into one of six tracks, including generative media, deep research, and enterprise orchestration.\n\nOrganized by Google DeepMind and 65labs, Singapore's AI builder collective, the hackathon featured a 100,000-credit Gemini API prize pool, with first place getting 30,000 credits.\n\nThe team had pivoted to a new idea due to time constraints: a feng shui app that could analyse a user's outfit and workspace through the phone camera in real time and assess how \"lucky\" they were.\n\nWei Khjan took the lead on prompting. He typed the first instructions into Claude, asking it to generate the workflow and code. Ler-Kuan focused on whether the AI's output aligned with feng shui concepts. Wah Kiang and Benny hovered over the codebase, refining ideas and flagging issues.\n\n\"For people who don't know how to read code, it's helpful to have people who do,\" Wei Khjan said.\n\nWhile waiting for the code to be generated, Ler-Kuan opened Google's AI Studio to design the app's logo. They called their app \"Feng Shui Banana.\"\n\nAfter about an hour, Claude generated the initial codebase for the app. It was designed to work with the Gemini Live API, enabling real-time image and text analysis. It ran but was riddled with bugs.\n\nAn error message flashed when they tested the camera feature, so Wei Khjan copied the error back into the AI and asked for it to be fixed. Minutes later, the feature worked.\n\nIt wasn't right. The feng shui logic was off, especially where colour analysis intersected with the user's birth timings. Ler-Kuan manually corrected the underlying dictionary and its mappings.\n\nThe team kept prompting to tighten the features: shorter explanations, clearer output, and more streamlined user interfaces.\n\nLunch arrived. The team stayed glued to their screens.\n\nThe app didn't respond instantly when a user changed their outfit, nor did it update its feng shui analysis in real time.\n\nWei Khjan explained how one prompt matters. Instead of issuing commands, he asked the AI to \"discuss it with me.\" The shift changed how the model reasoned, and it worked more like a collaborator.\n\nAfter some prompting, the app updated with a real-time camera analysis. It was striking to watch a feature emerging from a short back-and-forth with AI.\n\nI helped the team test the app.\n\nThe camera correctly identified what I was wearing: a dark green polo, a yellow participant tag, and a white name card hanging from my neck. According to the app, I was already wearing colours aligned with my luck for the day.\n\nThe app suggested small tweaks, such as additional accessories, that could enhance the feng shui of my outfit.\n\nThey finally had lunch and joked around to ease the tension. Four hours remained before they had to submit their project.\n\nLer-Kuan shifted focus to workspace feng shui, feeding knowledge into the model and refining how the app would evaluate desks and work setups. Wah Kiang and Benny worked on the video demo.\n\nThe team also revisited the app's tagline. After cycling through suggestions from multiple AI models, they settled on a line that didn't come from an AI at all: \"A wisdom, not a superstition.\"\n\nThey used Gemini to generate a storyboard for the demo video. The model laid out several scenes and drafted the script. The team followed along, filming clips and stitching everything together as they went.\n\nTheir workspace feature was also up and running.\n\nThe app had come together nicely. With some time to spare, they decided to add audio output for users who prefer listening to reading on a screen.\n\nThe first attempt to generate a voice using AI fell flat. It sounded robotic.\n\nAfter debugging and several iterations, they landed on a voice they liked, similar to how a Chinese feng shui master might speak.\n\nAs the deadline approached, the team was still stitching clips for their video and nitpicking the AI-generated presenter voice.\n\nThe organizers had urged teams to submit early. With about 15 minutes to spare, they made the call to lock the final cut and hit submit.\n\nThen it was over. The hunger hit immediately, and everyone got in line for some well-deserved food.\n\nEven as an observer, watching from the sidelines was tiring. Seven hours of vibe coding turned out to be anything but effortless.\n\nThe team didn't win a prize, but agreed that the hackathon had been worth it.\n\n\"Sometimes, the best experiences come from saying 'yes' without overthinking,\" said Ler Kuan. \"Innovation starts with curiosity and a little bit of spontaneity.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "fullText": "A project inside Google is attempting to supercharge employees with cutting-edge AI abilities — and hopes to turn the company into an \"AI-powered workplace.\"\n\nThe initiative, codenamed \"Project EAT,\" was spun up inside Google's \"AI and Infrastructure\" unit, according to internal documents reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe unit, internally abbreviated AI2 and led by company veteran Amin Vahdat, spearheads work on data centers, chips, and other key ingredients that underpin Google's AI technologies.\n\nAccording to internal documents, Project EAT was created to help employees adopt various AI products and standardize their use across the organization.\n\nProject EAT was created in May 2025 and began as a grassroots initiative among employees, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider. They added that it has led to the creation of some AI productivity tools that Googlers across the company are now using.\n\nIt comes as Google leaders, like those at other tech companies, are pushing for employees across the company to adopt AI into their workflows.\n\nPer an internal mission statement for Project EAT, the goal is to ensure AI2 is at the cutting edge of AI — from productivity tools to coding.\n\n\"We envision a future where Google is transformed into an AI-powered workplace, leading to dramatically higher productivity, greater employee engagement and collaboration, improved quality of work, better work-life balance, and greater product innovation across the company,\" it reads.\n\n\"We aim to lead Google into this vision by first leading this organizational change within AI2.\"\n\nWhile Google is aggressively shipping AI tools to customers and businesses, it's also fast adopting AI tools and practices internally.\n\nLast June, engineering VP Megan Kacholia sent an email telling engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Shortly after, CEO Sundar Pichai sent a clear message to staff: our rivals are using AI, and we need to do the same to compete.\n\nGoogle appointed Vahdat to lead its infrastructure group last year, and in December, he was promoted to senior vice president, reporting directly to Pichai. Vahdat played a key role in shaping Google's strategy with its AI chips, known as TPUs, and has spearheaded Google's efforts to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nAs tech companies pour billions into AI capital expenditure, a huge share of it at Google is going into Vahdat's org. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that A12 employs more than several thousand people.\n\nAn internal FAQ for the Project EAT page, reviewed by Business Insider, states that it had a 12-week seed-stage. It notes that this included a push for state-of-the-art code assistance tools within the AI2 org and that the test period resulted in \"promising signs of improved developer velocity, reduced toil, and enhanced code quality.\"\n\nThe name Project EAT is a reference to Google employees eating their own dog food, a spokesperson confirmed. Dogfooding is a common practice at tech companies where employees internally test and iterate products before launching them to market.\n\nInternal documents suggest EAT is pilot-testing new AI products and standards within AI2, with the goal of eventually adopting them across the company. \"The primary goal of Project EAT is to dramatically accelerate the adoption and integration of Google and 3rd party AI technologies within Al2.\"\n\nIt adds: \"We expect to improve standard practices across engineering, product management, TPM, and operations, thereby mitigating risks associated with the rapidly evolving external AI landscape and ensuring Google's technological leadership.\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "It’s what I had the most fun using Google’s Project Genie for, at least right now.\n\nIt’s what I had the most fun using Google’s Project Genie for, at least right now.\n\nThis week, a new generative AI tool from Google let me create bad knockoffs of 3D Nintendo worlds.\n\nCheck out my version of something like Super Mario 64:\n\nI didn’t like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but it’s better than my version of a Metroid Prime experience:\n\nOr how about my take on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, complete with a paraglider (and, briefly, a second Link):\n\nIt was all possible thanks to Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that Google gave me access to this week, though I don’t think I’m using it in exactly the way Google intended.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has been putting a lot of effort into building its AI “world” models that can generate virtual interactive spaces with text or images as prompts. The company announced its impressive-looking Genie 3 model last year, but it was only available as “a limited research preview” at the time. Project Genie, which will be rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US starting today, will be the first opportunity for more people to actually try out what Genie 3 is capable of.\n\nGoogle is releasing Project Genie now partly because it wants to see how people use it. “It’s really for us to actually learn about new use cases that we hadn’t thought about,” Diego Rivas, a product manager at Google DeepMind, tells The Verge. The company is already excited about how Genie could help to visualize scenes for filmmaking or for interactive educational media. You could, if you wanted, take a photo of your kids’ favorite toy and use it to prompt a Genie-generated world. Genie could potentially help robots navigate the real world, too. But Project Genie isn’t yet an “end-to-end product that we expect people to just use every day,” stressed Shlomi Fruchter, a Google DeepMind research director.\n\nWith Project Genie, you pick from a bunch of worlds designed by Google or define prompts for the environments and characters you want to create in your own world. After a brief wait, Genie first generates a thumbnail, then you can have it generate the world. You can explore each generated world for 60 seconds, and each has a resolution of about 720p and a frame rate of about 24fps. While you’re in one, you can (typically) move your character with the WASD keys, jump or go higher with a tap of your space bar, and turn the camera with arrow keys.\n\nOne of Google’s worlds, called “Rollerball,” features a blue orb in a white, snowy world, and as you roll around, the orb leaves a trail of paint behind it. As a “game,” Project Genie wasn’t great. There was nothing to do but roll around; there weren’t any objectives or goals. There was no sound. There was frustrating input lag that was even worse than what I sometimes experience with cloud gaming. (Some of this could be due to the generally poor Wi-Fi I get in my office.)\n\nOver the course of the 60-second experience, Genie sometimes forgot to show a paint streak where I had previously rolled. Occasionally, the ball would randomly stop laying down paint at all. So I started to distrust Genie’s ability to recall what I had already seen with my own eyes.\n\nAnother Google-designed world, “Backyard Racetrack,” was a little more fun because there was an actual track to follow. My racing lines were awful — the input lag didn’t help — but I enjoyed trying to make the turns and stay on the road. Near the end of the experience, though, part of the track unexpectedly turned into grass, which ruined the immersion. And the wheel rims looked really janky.\n\nI had a lot more fun pushing the limits of Project Genie to try and make 3D, AI-generated games featuring recognizable characters, like with my Super Mario, Metroid Prime, and The Legend of Zelda-themed worlds. While they made me laugh, the worlds don’t have scores or anything to strive for, so there’s nothing to do but walk or jump around. Even if there were specific things to do, the input lag made the worlds basically unplayable. (Again, this may be a Wi-Fi issue, but even when I was closer to my router, I still experienced lag.)\n\nI wasn’t able to make everything I wanted. Project Genie wouldn’t generate a world that I prompted with the scenario of Kingdom Hearts — here was my prompt, if you’re curious:\n\nIt’s a world filled with Disney characters with a steampunk vibe. Donald and Goofy are your sidekicks. Jack Skellington is present, as is Cloud Strife.\n\nYou are a spunky, anime teenager with spiky brown hair wielding a blade that is like a key.\n\nWhen I removed the specific names of characters and wrote descriptions of them instead, Project Genie generated a thumbnail preview of the world featuring characters that were dead ringers for Sora (the series’ protagonist), Donald, Goofy, Jack Skellington, and Cloud. But when I tried to generate the actual experience, Project Genie blocked me.\n\nI asked about why I was able to generate worlds with Nintendo characters. “Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides,” Rivas says. “As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback.” Rivas also notes that the Genie 3 model was “trained primarily on publicly available data from the web.” (This probably partially explains why Link deployed his paraglider in my test, which surprised me. At a high level, the Genie model is constantly trying to predict the next frame, and I’m sure there are many videos of people jumping in Breath of the Wild and then gliding forward, which the model probably learned from.) Shortly before publishing this article, Project Genie stopped letting me generate worlds based on Super Mario 64 due to “interests of third-party content providers.”\n\nAssuming Google clamps down on the ability to generate interactive worlds based on known gaming franchises — I can’t imagine Nintendo will be happy with what I was able to generate! — Project Genie otherwise isn’t that great at the moment. The input lag and 60-second limit make them pretty poor interactive experiences. Occasionally, I couldn’t control my character at all, only the camera. After the weirdness with the paint stripes and the road turning into grass, I had a general feeling that I couldn’t trust the worlds to stay consistent from moment to moment.\n\nProject Genie is better than some AI-generated worlds I tried last year, but it’s still much worse than an actual handcrafted video game or interactive experience. Fruchter described a potential future where the line blurs between different kinds of media thanks to technology like Genie, but I think it has a long way to go to get there.\n\nPerhaps my standards are too high. Project Genie is an experimental research prototype, after all. And maybe I’ll feel differently after the technology improves down the line. But I can’t imagine that people will want to spend an extended period of time jumping into these types of AI-generated worlds anytime soon. With world models, I don’t think we have to worry about the genie being out of the bottle just yet.",

    "description": "There are new enhancements to Failed Authentication Lock and Remote Lock.",
    "fullText": "Phones are valuable targets. If someone can steal your device, especially if they know how to break into it, they have access to a huge amount of your sensitive data. As such, good security features can mean the difference between losing that data, or protecting it entirely—even if your phone is long gone. Google has a number of anti-theft features baked in Android, appropriately called \"Theft Protection Features.\" While the company isn't announcing a slate of new features today, it did announced new updates to its existing Android Theft Protection features in a post on the company's Security Blog Tuesday. Here's what's new:\n\nFirst, the company announced updates to authentication safeguards, which apply to all Android devices running Android 16 or newer. That includes a new dedicated toggle in settings for Failed Authentication Lock, which automatically locks your screen after someone tries to guess your password too many times. Now, you can choose whether or not to keep this feature on right from settings.\n\nGoogle is also increasing the amount of time your phone locks up after too many failed passcode attempts, which reduces the chance for someone to break into your phone. I wouldn't have thought of this, but Google notes that it has included protections against children that try to break into your phone, by not counting identical passcode attempts against this retry limit. And while it isn't new, Google highlighted that since late 2025, all features and apps that use Android Biometric Prompt now work with Identity Check, which prevents unauthorized users from changing sensitive settings without a successful biometric authentication—meaning a face or fingerprint scan.\n\nThe company also announced enhancements to features that are available to devices running at least Android 10. First is an update to Remote Lock, which lets you lock up your phone from a web browser if it is stolen or goes missing. Now, you can set up a security question as part of the unlocking procedure. Even if someone knows your credentials, they'd need to know the answer to your security challenge before they could unlock your device. Tip: If you make the answer something nonsensical, you'll be even more protected (e.g., What is your mother's maiden name? h7r_t*2#). Just be sure to file that answer somewhere safe, like a password manager.\n\nUsers in Brazil also have two new security settings enabled by default. The first is Theft Detection Lock, which can detect when your device has been snatched out of your hand in a likely theft situation. The second is Remote Lock, so users in Brazil can take advantage of the above benefits without having to set anything up first—other than the option security challenge question, of course.\n\nThese updates might not be revolutionary, but they should help boost your Android's security a bit—and prevent your kids from locking you out of your phone for the day.",

    "description": "You might want to disable the buggy \"Take a Message\" feature on your Pixel phone.",
    "fullText": "A recent Google Pixel feature is reportedly turning on the microphone when it's not supposed to, and Google's finally acknowledged that there's a bug. Reports started as early as last September and gained traction last week, and now, Google has removed the feature on some older phones.\n\nCalled \"Take a Message,\" the buggy feature was released last year and is supposed to automatically transcribe voicemails as they're coming in, as well as detect and mark spam calls. Unfortunately, according to reports from multiple users on Reddit (as initially spotted by 9to5Google), the feature has started turning on the microphone while taking voicemails, allowing whoever is leaving you a voicemail to hear you. Audio leaks are bad in any circumstance, but they must feel especially nasty if you're trying to pretend you're not there.\n\nAffected users have have found that while the caller can hear the audio from the person receiving the voicemail, there's no indication on the receiver's end that their audio can be heard, aside from the green microphone indicator possibly turning on.\n\nThe issue has been reported affecting Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 4 to the Pixel 10, and on a recent support page, Google's finally acknowledging it. However, the company's action might not be enough, depending on how cautious you want to be.\n\nAccording to Community Manager Siri Tejaswini, the company has \"investigated this issue,\" and has confirmed it \"affects a very small subset of Pixel 4 and 5 devices under very specific and rare circumstances.\" The post doesn't go any further on the how and why of the diagnosis, but says that Google is now disabling Take a Message and \"next-gen Call Screen features\" on these devices.\n\nNext-gen Call Screen is a separate feature that allows Google's AI to ask a caller their name and the purpose of their call before taking a message. No bugs have been reported for it, but Google says it's disabling both features out of \"an abundance of caution.\"\n\nWhile this should prevent the issue from popping up for users with those phones, it's a bit of a heavy-handed fix. I've reached out to Google to check if Take a Message is only being removed temporarily while the company fixes the bug, or if it will now be permanently gone. In the meantime, Tejaswini does say that Pixel 4 and 5 owners will still be able to use manual and automatic Call Screening, which provide basic protection against spam. The post also suggests that affected users can rely on any call screening features provided by their cellular carriers.\n\nWhile it's encouraging that Google is taking action on the Take a Message bug, the company only seems to be acknowledging it for Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 models, at least for now. I've asked Google whether owners of other Pixel models should be worried, as user reports seem split on this. Still, because some have mentioned an issue with even the most up-to-date Pixel phone, if you want to practice your own abundance of caution, it might be worth disabling Take a Message on your device, regardless of its model number.\n\nTo do this, open your Phone app, then tap the three-lined menu icon at the top-left of the page. Navigate to Settings > Call Assist > Take a Message, and toggle the feature off.",

The company faces mounting pressure to give content owners ways to opt out of having their data crawled for AI, while still allowing traditional search engines to index this valuable data.\n\n\"We're now exploring updates to our controls to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features,\" Google said on Wednesday in a blog post.\n\nThat's a major concession from Google, which has been quietly but firmly pushing back against such demands.\n\nYet, the tech giant also warned that strict new controls could threaten its prized Search engine, which generates most of the company's profits.\n\n\"Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,\" the company said, arguing that search and AI are now deeply intertwined.\n\nGoogle says AI has been core to how Search works for more than a decade, helping rank results and surface relevant links. Creating sharp opt-outs for generative AI features, Google suggests, could undermine the basic mechanics that allow people to find information quickly and allow websites to be discovered at scale.\n\nAt stake is a deeper question about what Search should be in the AI era. Publishers increasingly argue that AI summaries substitute for their content rather than pointing users to it, undermining the grand bargain that has underpinned the web for decades. Google counters that drawing hard lines between search and AI risks unintended consequences, including degraded results and a worse user experience.\n\nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said the UK's proposal is \"progress,\" but didn't go far enough. His company helps run about 20% of the web and has been pushing for new standards to level the AI playing field.\n\n\"The CMA's recommendation today doesn't go far enough because it doesn't force Google to split search crawl from AI crawl,\" Prince told Business Insider, referring to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. \"Instead, it requires us all to trust that Google will not be evil when they build their unauditable black AI box.\"\n\n\"If the CMA wants to encourage innovation and competition in AI, the best thing they should do is force Google to play by the same rules as everyone else and split crawl for AI from the crawl for search,\" he added. \"Every company other than Google would support that because it fosters a healthy market. It's a no-brainer, so it's disappointing the CMA didn't go far enough today.\"\n\nA CMA consultation runs until February 25. Whether regulators can tighten the rules without, as Google warns, breaking Search may help determine not just the future of Google in the UK, but the shape of the open web itself.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",
