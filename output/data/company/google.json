    "fullText": "European Commission to assess whether Gemini owner is putting rival companies at a disadvantage\n\nThe EU has opened an investigation to assess whether Google is breaching European competition rules in its use of online content from publishers and YouTube creators for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe European Commission said on Tuesday it will examine whether the US tech company, which runs the Gemini AI model and is owned by Alphabet, is putting rival AI owners at a “disadvantage”.\n\n“The investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to such content, thereby placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage,” the commission said.\n\nIt said it was concerned that Google may have used content from web publishers to generate AI-powered services on its search results pages without appropriate compensation to publishers and without offering them the possibility to refuse such use of their content.\n\nThe commission said it was also concerned as to whether Google has used content uploaded to YouTube to train its own generative AI models without offering creators compensation or the possibility to refuse.\n\n“Content creators uploading videos on YouTube have an obligation to grant Google permission to use their data for different purposes, including for training generative AI models,” the commission said.\n\nGoogle does not pay YouTube content creators for their content, nor does it allow them to upload their content on YouTube without allowing Google to use such data, it said. The commission noted that rival developers of AI models are barred by YouTube policies from using YouTube content to train their own AI models.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”\n\nThe EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever.\n\n“Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”\n\nThe EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.\n\nIn September, EU regulators issued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals. Donald Trump said the fine was “discriminatory”.\n\nElon Musk’s social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, was fined €120m by EU tech regulators last week for breaching online content rules. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of transparency of the platform’s advertising.\n\nThe fine also attracted criticism from US officials, including the secretary of state Marco Rubio, who wrote on X that the fine was “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments”.\n\nThe European Commission opened an investigation earlier this year into Meta over its rollout of AI features on WhatsApp, its messaging platform. Last year it fined Meta €798m for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.\n\nIn 2024, Apple lost a fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay €13bn in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nLast month, the head of Google’s parent company said people should not “blindly trust” everything AI tools tell them.\n\nSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said AI models were “prone to errors” and urged people to use them alongside other tools. He also warned that no company would be immune if the AI bubble burst.",

The department has until Saturday, December 19, to comply with the order.\n\nTrump has also ordered the DOJ to investigate Hoffman, along with other individuals he views as political enemies, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, over their ties to Epstein.\n\nHoffman, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, has previously said that he had to hire security after Musk fueled conspiracy theories about his relationship with Epstein.",

    "fullText": "Google phones keep offering great value for the money, dropping in price very quickly after their release, including the latest Pixel. The Google Pixel 10, with the 128GB going for $599 (originally $799) and the 256GB for $699 (originally $899), are both at record low prices right now, according to price-tracking tools.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the latest in the series to be released this year, back in September. It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).\n\nThis Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",
